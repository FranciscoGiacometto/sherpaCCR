I am sure it is not the old, hard, heavy chair that my students need to use every day. I teach third grade in a very low-income neighborhood in California with 100% of my students receiving free or reduced meals and 90% are English language learners. It is a very diverse population with Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Indian, and Black students. Many of the students are considered high-risk due to the conditions in which they live (gangs, violence, and drugs). They are also the most charming and eager students anyone could hope to meet. My students thrive in an atmosphere that is consistent, fair, and filled with many opportunities to express themselves Imagine going to work every day and having to sit in old, hard, heavy chairs. It is not a comfortable learning environment for students. They spend more than half their school day sitting in these chairs. The Virco Zuma chairs are comfortable, light weight, ergonomically designed with the student in mind, and the cool cantilever shape makes sitting down fun! When children are sitting correctly, they can spend their energies focused on learning rather than on finding a more comfortable way to place their bodies. These ergonomically styled chairs will help this year's class learn in a comfortable environment as well as many futures classes to come.

It sounds silly, but I thought, 'Okay, the way the world works can be changed.'' Jay Silver We want our students, who are learning about how the world works, to understand that their ideas can bring about powerful change. We live in a community with a mixture of low-economic families and middle-class families. Many students have limited English, but they work very hard. Their parents are very supportive and work with their children to ensure success in school. Our students are bright and motivated. They enjoy learning about and using new technology. They amaze us with their ideas and willingness to persevere when faced with a problem. Our students have been creating products digitally, and we are ready to go to the next level and use the skills they have learned to have an object come to life. We think the best way to get started is with the Lego Robotics kit. Students will then be able to design and create a robot of any style and with any function. Seeing their designs come to life will allow our students to experience a true 21st century classroom. The skills students will acquire by learning to use a true robotics kit will help them throughout their school career and into the workforce. We want to provide an environment where creative ideas can be nurtured and developed and the students' ideas can come to life. Our students have brilliant ideas.

It is mandatory in our state approved curriculum that the children receive at least an hour nap. I would like for my students to sleep on cots that are not worn by years of use. New cots would provide better comfort for the children. My preschool class consists of 3 and 4 year old children. My students are very eager to learn and are very energetic. My school is located in the inner city. The Early Childhood department of my district has made great efforts to supply every child within this city the opportunity to a highly qualified free preschool education. The children will use the requested materials during nap time. The children will each have an individual cot placed around our classroom for them to rest on before the afternoon session begins. This will give the children a chance to 'reboot' before continuing with the rest of our day. My project will make a difference because the children will have a clean, sturdy, and comfortable place to rest. This will allow the students to continue with the rest of their day with a heightened energy level which will cause them to be more attentive, alert, and focused on learning.

All of our students have hearing loss, ranging from mild to profound. In addition, some of our students also have other disabilities including autism, cognitive delays, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy. Many of our students enter preschool with almost no language. They do not know how to communicate their wants and needs to adults or peers. As Teachers of the Deaf, we rely heavily on pictures and visual aids to introduce very basic vocabulary. It is our job to help our students learn to communicate with us, their families, and the outside world. This can be either through sign language, assisted sign, oral communication or a mixture of these modes of communication. Our preschool team would like to purchase one iPad for every classroom. An iPad can be a wonderful visual tool to introduce basic vocabulary, and there are fantastic applications that target specific skills such as advocacy, sign language, listening therapy... not to mention practice with preschool skills such as shape matching, counting and letter identification!

In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the TEACHER is most important.' I could not agree more. As a third grade teacher and life-long learner, I encourage my students to explore and go beyond the walls of our classroom. My class of 13 boys and 11 girls is a lively one. This group of children is first kind and cooperative with one another. They set their personal academic goals, and respect individual starting points knowing our class objective is growth for all. Our school and district is quaint and clean. It is full of caring parents, staff, teachers, and administrators. We are not a wealthy district or community, but we make do. The kids greet me at the door each morning with a handshake and smile. They come ready to learn, yet teach me something new each day!The technology available to the students is limited and outdated. This restricts both my ability and theirs with regard to exposing and exploring all the wonderful things that lie beyond our little school, district, and community. Technology is not the be-all and end-all of education, but it can provide children with experiences that they might not otherwise have growing up in a small somewhat rural town. I am seeking an iPad with a protective case for my classroom. The protective case with 24 third graders is self-explanatory, but let me share with you the purpose of the iPad. Technology of today has opened the door to more resources than one can imagine for adults and children alike. On a daily basis, my children would be able to utilize various online literacy and math programs which are not available to them outside of the school. These programs support the struggling student, the 'average' student, as well as the student who is ready for the next step in their education. Having an iPad would allow more children the chance to engage in these learning opportunities. More importantly, an iPad in our classroom would provide children with the ability to listen to books while following along. This will build fluency, as well as expose the children to a wider variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction with their specific needs and interests taken into account. The addition of an iPad to our two classroom computers (each over two decades old) will not revolutionize my teaching, as I believe what Bill Gates has said, 'Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is most important.' However, I also believe your model of generosity and kindness will make a difference in my students' lives. To know there are people in the world who care about both children and education is powerful. Thank you.

One of the biggest obstacles my students face is a lack of confidence in their ability. It breaks my heart that they don't see what I see in them! I want to build them up by showing that the more a person reads, the better he/she becomes at all things academic. My students come from an impoverished background and have faced much adversity, and I want to help give them a taste of reading success to propel them into productive, purposeful adult lives. My students will use these books as a part of an independent reading initiative I will be starting in the New Year. As a first year teacher, I am realizing that gaps in reading will only be closed by doing reading itself. Having a library will allow me to have books on hand for my students to be able to read both in and out of my classroom. By having high interest books in my class, I can visually promote reading and literature while also having an immediate means of making recommendations and starting dialogue around books my students are reading. I am excited for my students to become avid readers through having more access to books in which they would be interested in reading. Thank you in advance!

I have a small room that serves as an office and treatment space for children with communication deficits. My approach is to directly teach children the communication skill they need and then allow for practice and carryover through play with peers. My school has a wide variety of programs ranging from severely disabled students in both primary and secondary life skills classrooms, to the district level gifted program, in addition to a K-5 regular education elementary program. My caseload includes students with autism, selective mutism, intellectual disability, language disorders, and developmental delays. My project is specifically designed for those students with autism and selective mutism. I work with them directly on social communication skills which is very stressful and difficult for them. Many of them dislike school due to the anxiety caused by having to communicate with peers and adults. I have had success with having them come into the speech room with a buddy or two and complete puzzles, play board games or build with Lego's. My supply, however, is quite low and I am in need of a bigger variety of high interest puzzle and building toys to keep their engagement and enthusiasm up as well as their peers. With the addition of the puzzles and magnetic toys I've requested, my students will have more choices of what they can do with their speech buddies. The few items that I have used to date have allowed one of my students with significant anxiety related to autism and selective mutism to begin to build friendships with two other boys in his class. He is able to practice looking at others when he speaks, asking questions, initiating conversation, and being flexible when interacting with others. His mother reports that he no longer fights coming to school because he has something to look forward to every day before lunch. This project will allow my students to practice their communication skills, make friends and have fun while working on speech, social communication, problem solving, and language skills. High interest activities like I have selected will be motivating for them and allow for carryover of their skills in a more natural setting of playing with peers.

As an educator, these tables will give me the opportunity to monitor my students more efficiently and effectively during both individual and group time activities. Providing opportunities to become a team member throughout the school day and work collaboratively with peers is always a win-win situation. Donations towards this project will help provide a positive learning environment that focuses on the importance of social growth and educational happiness. My goal is to help my students learn how to work cooperatively with their classmates and will allow them the ability to use their positive communication skills not only in school, but throughout their lives.

I work with students in grades K-12 that have serious medical issues such as cancer. They all live in high poverty areas. It is a joy and a privilege to work with these students. Some students have life threatening conditions such as cancer. Other students are on the transplant list waiting for an organ transplant. A few students have been hit by a car or were in a car accident. Most of the students experience pain on a daily basis. All of my students are very brave and are a pleasure to work with. In addition to their serious medical problems, all of my students reside in high poverty areas. Most of my students come from single parent families. The families are in need and spend a majority of their time taking their children to medical appointments and to the hospital. My students need a laminator, art supplies, paper, various writing materials, and mailing envelopes so they can create projects to share with others in the world. Our school lacks basic supplies. With these supplies the students will be able to use hands-on learning in their lessons. Students will create projects, mail them and share them electronically with others around the world. They can post them in the hospital to bring joy and encouragement to others! Since my students are under a great deal of stress and most of the students have chronic pain due to a serious medical conditions, integrating art and hands-on learning into our academic lessons is necessary. Project based learning helps students develop critical thinking skills. The families love to see the books and projects the students' create. Laminating the projects helps families battling cancer save the students' precious work forever! We share the projects with the community and families. We create research presentations. This helps to develop students' critical thinking and analysis skills. We integrate math, art, technology, english and science concepts. Students create sophisticated writing and research projects. Students write books and letters. Brave students battling cancer inspire others with their work. Students can save these projects forever!

We are in a low income district and a low income school. Parents are very involved in their children's education and we have an active PTA. I have a group of regular volunteers in my classroom that work with students. My kinders LOVE choice time during our daily schedule and they really enjoy playing with our current collection of kitchen materials (plastic fruits and vegetables, dishes and cups), but they would love to be able to use these materials in this new play kitchen. Many of the students may not have these items at home and it supports their exploratory and dramatic play as well as learning to work together with their other classmates. The play kitchen will add to our materials students use for free choice time and exploratory play. Choice time in our classroom becomes a very noisy and boisterous time. many students are learning how to get along and how to navigate socially.

For this reason the students access to technology is varied from students to student. That being said all students no matter the background, care deeply for the environment and wanted to find ways to help sustainability and boogie boards was one of the suggestions. The students will use the boogie boards on a daily basis in place of white boards for showing and representing work in the class. Currently the students use white boards about 2-3 hours of the day during work time, which leads to wasting marker and other classroom resources. These boards will help students in my class have easy access to simple technology. They will also benefit by helping the environment by using a more sustainable option in the classroom.

It saddens me that, due to the low income area of our school, many of these students do not have the opportunity of exploring their talents outside our music classroom. Therefore, I believe it is so important for me to give them as many experiences and paths to explore and refine their inner musician as I possibly can! I love using music to create connections to literacy. Students who connect and create memories with books in the music classroom will be more likely to read on their own. Adding music to books is easy! We simply look for opportunities to implement sound effects within the story. We then assign these sound effects to unpitched percussion instruments to bring the text to life! Building up our selection of unpitched percussion will give us limitless options when adding sound effects to children's literature.

The best learning occurs when students have the chance to collaborate with their peers. Throughout the day I have the opportunity to work with 96 students. Due to increase class sizes, we have had the opportunity to use a second classroom. This classroom currently has a wide variety of left over desks and tables that were left over from other schools in our district. While this works, it is not an ideal learning environment. Students sit at desks of different shapes and sizes that do not best allow for group work. We are looking to create a classroom environment that is truly inviting to all students. We hope to arrange our classroom so that students can easily collaborate with one another on projects and academic tasks. These tables will allow us to work with students in a more collaborative manner. Our goal is to help facilitate students in a way so that they can learn from one another. In sixth grade, it's extremely important that students have the chance to interact with one another to complete academic tasks.

What if you needed a tissue for your runny nose...but had to use toilet paper or a paper towel? Healthy and happy kids make for bright and healthy learners. My students come from a very low socioeconomic status rural area in North Dakota. Little things, like getting a tissue when their nose is runny, or counting the minutes until lunch because the last time they ate something substantial was the day before school, plague my students on a daily basis. It is difficult for them to focus on their studies and learning when they are dealing with rumbly tummies. Most of my students do not even have essentials such as Kleenex or pencils to use during class. I want to distribute the snack during my reading group in the morning. This will tide the students over until lunch time so they can focus on their reading, and not their tummies. A vacuum, hand sanitizer, and cleaning wipes will help ensure my students will stay healthy throughout the school year. Little things such as Kleenex, pencils, and a paper sharpener are things my students wish they had on a daily basis. My students will become become better learners and will be able to focus when their normal, everyday, daily needs are being met. The students will be able to focus on reading and vocabulary, and not on growling tummies and pencils. The student's lives will be tremendously affected by this donation. Students have a really hard time focusing on reading when they are worried about how far away lunch is. Students will be able to not worry about the inability to have sharpened pencils during class time when they know they will have access to one in the classroom.

We are in a low-income, high poverty area where the majority of our students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. A lot of students also have parents or family members serving in the military. My students are very supportive of one another and want to succeed within our classroom and within life. As a teacher, providing my students with additional items to support their learning, is quite expensive. This is why I am seeking out your help. With the two iPads we are requesting, we will use them to monitor students online and to access learning sites such as IXL and Raz-kids. These sites allow teachers the ability to see how students are doing and what they are struggling with. My students and I will both use these iPads to monitor their learning on these sites and provide assistance when needed. iPads are very portable and will allow use to move about the classroom freely to provide specific support each student. This project will help make learning fun, meaningful, and more engaging. It will also allow students to receive more specific and direct feedback from myself and other students within the class.

Students need access to engaging text that represents their own experiences, interests, and culture. Currently, our library is stocked with few books that reflect the students in the room.
