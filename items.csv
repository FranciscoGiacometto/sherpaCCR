This will help them with their sensory integration because it creates a new pathway for development. Yoga will help them learn body awareness, eye hand coordination, and spatial awareness.

My students have difficulty with self regulation, body awareness, and have poor motor coordination. I am requesting yoga mats, videos, and cards to help improve physical, emotional, and educational benefits. Yoga will help my students learn body awareness, eye hand coordination, and spatial awareness as well as learning to calm their bodies. We breathe, play, stand, stretch to find balance. Donations to this project will help my students with autism gain needed sensory integration while learning a healthy form of exercise and self regulation techniques.

The specific apps will be chosen with individual student needs to help differentiate instruction. Many of my students do not have access to any type of technology within their homes, so it is up to the school to provide this opportunity. Our school is a Math Science Technology Magnet school, there are 34 students and two computers in my classroom. We are a title 1 school. So many of our students get breakfast and lunch for free. The two iPad minis in my classroom will engage and challenge my students with brand new and interactive methods. I will use the iPad minis to differentiate instruction through small groups. This way I will be able to individualize instruction for those students who are outside my small group and the group I will be working with. Since students all know how to play various electronic games, such as PSP, XBOX, Wii, and many others, I feel these iPad minis will help engage and motivate my students in learning the skills they need for reading and math interactively. The speakers will help us hear what we record. The tripod will help us set up a station to record with the iPad mini. The Flash drive will help save all their recordings. The covers will protect the iPad minis. My students need the two iPad minis, tripod, speakers, flash drive, and covers to allow them to learn at their own differentiated levels.

There is a huge problem with implementing this program for all of my students because we do not have enough netbooks for my students. My classes range from 33-38 students! I have to allow my students to use my personal tablet and laptop because we only have 30 netbooks. I also have to send two students to two different classroom to use a desktop. Even with all of these accommodations, there is always at least 2 or 3 students that are not able to do Teen Biz because we do not have enough netbooks. Although some of my students use their cellphones to complete the articles and questions, the small screen on the phones is not beneficial to reading long articles and answering questions. The use of the requested tablets will also serve as an additional resource for my ELL's and struggling readers with the use of specific apps. The tablets will also serve as additional research devices. Honestly, it is a struggle to implement Teen Biz because we need more technological devices. The tablets will allow more students to do Teen Biz activities and improve their literacy skills. Technology motivates and engages all students, regardless of their academic level. The tablets will also expose them to more complex texts, allow my ELL's to acquire language faster, and serve as an additional technological resource in the classroom.

We are a large city high school with an ethnically diverse population. Most of my students have never excelled in school and struggle to believe in their own abilities. Most of the kids really want to graduate, but struggle to sustain a high level effort on a daily basis. I would describe the majority of my students as really good kids. We have a large Hispanic and African-American population and many of the students are trying to become the first generation to graduate from high school.

I believe that when the students receive the books they will breath a sigh of relief. They will be very encouraged and their effort to read Othello will increase. The students really like to act out the play, but often get stumped by Elizabethan English. The No Fear Shakespeare version includes the original and modern version of the text. This will give us greater flexibility. I will still be able to cover puns, iambic pentameter, rhyme scheme and other theater terms. However, the modern version will give the students a level of comfort and prevent them from shutting down when we get into more dynamic aspects of Othello.

If you don't practice reading, you cannot develop your literacy skills. I work with students who need access to books in their native language, so they can read, as they learn English. My students are middle schoolers in 4th though 8th grades. All are immigrants from other countries, are learning English, have relocated to an inner-city urban area, and are in an over-crowded school. Most of them are Spanish speakers, and come from families who have limited or no English speakers as well. Most students come from low-income families and qualify for free lunch status. The literacy skills with which they arrive to school vary from very beginning to highly developed. They are still expected to read and keep up with the classroom curriculum, however, and this is very difficult to do in a language they are still in the process of learning. My students are eager to learn and wish to adapt to the culture and language quickly. This is why I need to provide them with access to quality literature in a language they understand. My school district has frozen budgets, which means I am very limited as to what I can purchase for my students, though they need instructional materials. Students will utilize these books to check them out for independent reading, as nightly reading is required as homework. Independent reading at one's instructional level will develop many reading skills, such as comprehension, synthesizing information, questioning, inferencing, summarizing, fluency, and accuracy. Additionally, independent reading will develop students' vocabulary, even in their native language, and this knowledge will transfer to and enhance their English acquisition. Students are often asked to respond to their reading in writing, and frequently they must refer to their texts, but if they cannot truly comprehend what they read because of a language barrier, they will not continue to develop any literacy skills at all because they do not have appropriate materials to use. Books for my students will improve their literacy dramatically, since I only have a modest collection in varying levels for 15 limited-English students. Our school library has a very limited selection of Spanish books too. Students are expected to read daily in class and for homework, and the small selection that I have compiled is not sufficient for these students' use throughout the year.

Even though our students live in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world, they very rarely step outside the confines of their own neighborhoods. As a result, their world view is limited by the blinders of a few city blocks. Literature, especially multicultural literature, provides students a window into the lives of others. The purpose of this project is to familiarize my students with Muslim life. While Muslim students represent a small minority in our school, each year their numbers continue to grow. Sadly, many of our Muslim students are bullied. I hope to use the book Ms. Marvel to teach our non-Muslim students that Muslim students are no different than any other student. Since the story’s protagonist is Muslim, I’m hopeful that Muslim students will feel a sense of pride as they see an aspect of themselves represented in the curriculum. Conversely, I’m hopeful that the non-Muslim students will learn respect and tolerance for their Muslim peers. Once individuals learn to look beyond outward differences, they start to see that the similarities we share as human beings are far more important. By learning about others, we often learn about ourselves. If students can recognize that people are people, they will not only respect people that are different but respect themselves, too.

Students come from a variety of different home lives, and a varied level of support systems around them. Locke's mission is to foster meaningful learning for all by increasing rigor and student engagement. My students are excited to learn and held to super high expectations. Students want to be successful and play an important part of our society today and in the future.A guided math table would be a great addition to my math classroom for my students. It is super important for students to be able to work in small groups, one-on-one with the teachers, or independently with teacher guidance to succeed in the 5th grade. As I reflect on my past teaching years, I am a strong believer that guided math and reading is the best way to run a successful classroom. Students enjoy working independently while I myself, as the teacher, can focus on skills that students are missing and need to master to succeed. A small group table would be so extremely helpful to my classroom for many reasons, one being that we are not constantly moving desks around taking valuable class time away.

I have been teaching Math and recently ELL in special education department. It is the end of the year and I am trying to come up with some good ideas to decorate my classroom in August to welcome my new students for the new school year 2017-2018. I need new math and encouragment posters as well as bulletin board borders and a 'Presenter Clicker Pointer Remote Control'. The students enjoy a welcoming class and math hints on the wall. Technology is essential and the sooner they can be exposed to it, the more comfortable they are in the future. It is never too early to plan for next school year. Thank you for your support. The students like the class when is cheerful and welcoming. The students need inspiration to study and behave. We all do need reminders to do well every day. The students want to feel good and if a few hints on the wall help them to feel good, I want to make sure I provide them those hints to make them feel good. When they students feel good, they are more positive, more participant in class, and, for sure, they are more successful in class. My students may forget very simple daily math skills, and it is my job to provide them with written and verbal assistance to make them feel good about learning.

While our classroom does have many barred instruments, we are lacking drums. Due to not having enough drums, physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited.
