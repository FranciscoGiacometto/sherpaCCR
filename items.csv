They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. We have a rapidly expanding band program. If the rate of growth keeps up, I will not be able to get instruments to all the students who want to join band next year. I have been acquiring instruments in every way I can, but even with the used instruments I've been able to acquire, I haven't been able to keep up with the need for instruments among students who couldn't otherwise afford to rent or buy one from a music store. This instrument will not only give many students an enriching opportunity to learn to play the clarinet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing this clarinet could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music. This project will bring a quality clarinet into my classroom and into the hands of a student who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford this experience. Please help me create an amazing experience for my students ","My students need a clarinet, a ligature and lesson book in order to support an expanding band program.",Music & The Arts,Grades 6-8,Other,885.29,Fully Funded
6efa4cf55f68328042b47ad570ea4742,Eye Hand Coordination For Lower Grades,"All students, including the Marcy students, love to try new things and challenge themselves. Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

Or perhaps, wanted to show something enhanced right away? As a teacher, this is our life- to share! Both my eighth graders and myself are eager to share everything we learn and know with our class. A document camera will enable us to do so. I teach in a Title One, diverse, multi-cultural school. With over 29 languages represented on our campus, we need all the tools we can use to communicate with our students. My eighth graders love math and technology, and luckily math is a universal language. Our school is in a low socioeconomic neighborhood but full of eager, creative learners. In our district, our goal is to have all children excelling and to be college and career ready. We follow the common core standards to ensure that all students are getting the same quality education. My students get so excited when we are able to experience new learning through our smart boards, graphing calculators, laptop carts, and responders; however, we have needs that a document camera would fulfill. With the document camera, my students will have greater opportunities to share their work and discoveries, and learn in a more dynamic way! This will lead to greater listening and work skills. With this, they can share in a positive, encouraging manner. They will be able to use and display math manipulatives under the camera to explain thinking, as well as share their work and steps. Our school is big on STEM teaching in our classrooms, which allows more investigative exploration of topics. As a teacher, I would be able to model more efficiently to the class as a whole. This will also save A LOT of time, for documents not available for the smart board to view, will be able to be shown and not needed to be copied onto a whiteboard. Picture your child in a classroom with a document camera, would you not feel more confident in the learning taking place verses not having a document camera? They truly do help speed up the learning process, while making the learning more engaging and fun! Technology is the future! This will give our students another opportunity to be challenged and to express their ideas and thinking in a different, functional way. It is a more efficient way for me to model, to demonstrate, to display my graphing calculator to teach steps, and to show each other'ÂÂs work, which will enhance learning and knowledge of the world around us. Teaching is my passion and with the use of a document camera, I will be an even more effective educator for our future!Other's ","My students need a document camera in order to engage their learning, save time, and view virtually anything within moments.","Applied Learning, Math & Science",Grades 6-8,Technology,539.47,Fully Funded

My students struggle with our language, and when they can't see what trick or change I made on a worksheet, it is hard for them, or when someone solved a problem and it can't be seen. My students are from all over the world. Some are just learning the English Language and this is their first classroom in America. Other students have been here or were born here. Our school is striving to achieve excellence in a low socioeconomic part of our state. We encourage and create lifelong learners and instill go ethics into our students. This way they do go on to further their education. Our school itself is on a 98% free and reduced lunch program to help the struggling parents. We don't have the funding for document cameras and other things that will help our children be prepared for the world. The teachers usually provide most of the school supplies and other basic needs for the children. Having a document camera will help my students inspire and learn from one another. It will help them see clearly where we are on a worksheet no matter where they sit in the room. An example of an activity is when we use factors in a Venn diagram to find the greatest common factor. Students can come up and place their document under the camera and explain how and why they got the answer they did. If they are incorrect it allows the other students to encourage a different answer. The students can now see each other's evidence and reasoning. This request is very important to me because even though my students are from a low socioeconomic area I want them to have the tools and skills any other child would. This way they can thrive in the environment and not continue to repeat a cycle of poverty. My students will have a chance to learn from each other and have clarity when doing a worksheet.

Being a visual learner myself, I understand the need for my class to have that same experience. Children need to SEE what they are learning to develop and challenge their minds. My classroom is currently full of 34 second grade students who are all eager to learn and come from very diverse and difficult backgrounds. I teach in a high poverty neighborhood in Arizona, where most of the population in our school are English Language Learners. Our kids have a strong desire to learn and challenge themselves, despite the hard challenges they face at home. They are extremely hard workers and push themselves to 'Achieve the American Dream'. As a child and an adult, I have always been a very visual learner. I need to see it to understand it, and experience it to remember it. My second grade students are the exact same way and I would love to give them ALL the opportunity to fall in love with learning through the use of a document camera. Since I have a large class this year, 34 students, it is difficult to model and teach in the way they need it without them seeing it first hand. By using a document camera, I can not only bring more technology into the classroom, but I can enhance their learning experience. Showing them other students work using the camera, or modeling lessons and independent practice that they can all visually see will be so much more rewarding to them as a learner. I also would love for my students to be able to teach their classmates using this technology tool. I can only see positive learning and success coming from the use of a document camera in my classroom! I honestly believe that a document camera could make a huge difference in my students' behavior and learning. Technology is so widely used within our world now, it is so important to bring it into the classroom as well!

We work hard every day to help improve our reading skills while having fun. It's my goal that I will be able to help my students develop a love for reading just like my teachers did for me. I teach first grade at a school with a very diverse population. We have students from all different backgrounds with very different home lives. My school is located in an area where most of the families do not have much money, and often barely have enough money to cover their basic needs. My school is a choice school in our district so parents from any part of the district can choose to send their students to our school. The families here want only the best for their child and work hard to help their children to succeed in school even if they have limited time, money or even English speaking skills at home. The listening center will be allow small groups of students to listen to a story and follow along with the reader in their book. After the story they will be able listen to questions and check their comprehension of the stories even if they are still working on becoming independent readers. Having this listening center will allow one more center in my classroom so I can have smaller groups to work with and give students more personalized help during their time working with me each day. The whisper phones will be used when students are practicing letter sounds and decodable reader books. It can become very noisy with students reading to themselves, but these whisper phones will allow them to whisper their words and still hear themselves saying it without distracting others in their group or the entire class.

When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

They've never truly found a book they are inspired by, or a book that offers a strong role model that makes them want to know more about themselves and the world around them. I want change! My traditional English students are in 8th grade and have tried to find many creative ways around not doing real work so that they can 'slide by' and not be noticed. They 'fake read' because they don't know who they are as readers and they no longer care about stories or the heroes that lay within the pages of a novel. I have a large percentage of energetic students curious about history. I have students with low reading scores who would never consider 'reading' on their top 100 hobbies of 'after school activities'. My school's largest demographic category is low social economic status. I believe every child can learn, but that they need the right tools. I believe that the adapted young adult book 'Unbroken' can be the very book that changes their reluctance into sizzling energy. Olympian Louis Zamperini spends a difficult 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. 'Unbroken' is the story about resilience of the human mind, body and spirit, and can give inspiration to students and teach them the value of perseverance. Students will engage in literature circles and will discuss the major events in small group settings. Students will not only write objective academic summaries, but will, but will cite evidence that proves Zamperini is a hero. Students will also draw inferences about the main character to support their opinion and establish a formal writing style by doing so. Overall, the book will inspire struggling readers to read more, and to write more compelling essays that challenge them to cite evidence and to use logical reasoning in their essays. If I can get one student to love this book, I may have perhaps caused them to become life long readers. If I can do that, I have created a critical thinker. I've helped create one more soul dedicated to becoming a stronger citizen all by having read a book about a tough American hero who refused to give up.

My students will use the laptop to project images onto a monitor that can be seen in their daily videos. Things like weather, birthdays and even videos will be projected onto the monitor, much like an actual news broadcast. They will also use the laptop to edit their videos and be able to include things like titles, transitions and video effects, even green screen. My students will gain experience with current technology. This will allow them to create their daily videos to include real world broadcast techniques.

Creating a multi-genre classroom library with popular books is what I'm hoping will be the key to unlocking a life-long love of reading for my students. I have the best students in the whole world! OK, well I am admittedly biased. While they are not the highest socio-economic level, they are hard working and goal oriented. Most of my middle school students want to go to college and work toward that goal. Many of the parents have a college background, and those that don't work hard to keep their families comfortable. Unfortunately, we don't have a great local library and parents don't always have the opportunity to take their kids to the library to get the books that they want. Our school places literacy development very high in our academics and we want our students to improve their reading levels each year. We have a designated 30 minute period 4 times a week where students are expected to read to work toward this goal. Our district has had a multitude of budgetary woes in recent years and one area that has been hit hard is in our libraries. We just don't have the number of current books available to meet the students wants. I can't wait to stand at my bookshelf with a student and have a conversation with them about books! Often times a student will not know what to read and I have to fly somewhat blindly when suggesting books that they may enjoy. With a well stocked library we can actually look at, pick up, and peruse through potential books to read. Students participate in book talks weekly, which helps others to add to their queue of next books to read. If I have many of these books available to the students it would help to increase the number of books that they read. Furthermore, we are going to be having Literacy Circle units this year where students will read multiple books from a specific genre. This allows student to have thoughtful talks and discussions on specific genre traits, theme and plot development, as well as how characters and setting work to move the plot and theme along. Kids need to have books available to them if we are going to ask them to read. The flip chart easel and Post-It notes will also help. Not all kids are readers. Often kids 'hate' reading because they haven't found the right book(s) for them. If students have a variety of genres, subject, and lengths of books I am confident that this can help to tear down the 'I hate reading' wall. I've seen students blossom when they have a chance to talk to their peers about books. With a well stocked classroom library I know that students will read more, increase their literacy and ultimately foster a stronger knowledge base.

I teach at an elementary school that has many needs, particularly when it comes to providing opportunities for our students use technology. Seventy-four percent of our students receive free or reduced lunch. We also have a number of English language learners, which make it really important to provide them with learning experiences where their ability to speak English isn't as important as being able to create a visual image of what they want to say. We will use the ipads to create a number of movies, which will include book trailers, safety tips, bullying information videos and original stories. They will use a huge amount of critical thinking as they learn to create visual stories; the elements of a good story, the analysis of what makes an effective movie, character development, the way a shot is framed, creating the right mood by using the right music, the editing, etc. Using technology provides opportunities for my students to participate in learning 21st century skills. They have limited access to technology in their home life, so it is critical that they have the opportunity to use technology at school.

However, in my particular classroom (and many other classrooms in my building), the students are knowledge hungry and not afraid to struggle to improve their learning. The students in my room need to read a variety of complex texts for multiple purposes. The students also need to find evidence to support their learning. Having the evidence kits will help my students read nonfiction and fiction text while being able to find key details, compare and contrast, summarize,discuss vocabulary and find the theme for multiple grade level texts. During the school day, we will use white boards for multiple reasons and in multiple subject areas. With the white boards the students can practice their work and show their thinking. Students also hold up white boards in whole group lessons so the teacher can get a snapshot of learning and understanding to provide more intense intervention/small group time when needed. Currently, my school does not have a traditional literacy program. As teachers, we are finding our own materials that increase rigor and engagement in the classroom.

Therein lies the power of the classroom, and any teacher worth their salt knows that forming a community--particularly a reading community--is the foundation to a great year. My students are bright and willing, but need assistance in terms of literacy resources and experiences, which is why I am constantly on the lookout for great books to read together. Most of my students come from families with two working parents. As a working mom with two children of my own, I often lament my family's loss of reading time to the demands of just making it through the day. Reading, in my opinion, is mistakenly considered a solitary activity. You may take the words in through your own eyes, but I believe so much is lost if you don't share everything that happens after that--the joy, surprise, confusion, frustration and reward of reading good books. I want to create these opportunities in school, for this is what creates lifelong readers. If my project is funded, my students will participate in a genre study of historical fiction. Students will be able to chose an historical novel that interests them and read in small groups of 3-4, while together we will use our selections to examine the genre and its traits. It is important that students are exposed to and immersed in many kinds of print and many types of literature. A genre study is one way to accomplish that. I chose the genre of historical fiction as one way to support history standards. Our past is too vast and complicated to be covered in one history class per year; reading historical fiction not only brings the past to life, but it also exposes children to parts of history that may not be covered adequately in their course of social studies. Additionally, my students will read primary sources and informational texts associated with the time-preiod of their chosen novel, which adds another element of genre exposure (fiction v. non-fiction). Ultimately, a genre study will allow us to not only enjoy historical content, but also to 'compare and contrast a fictional portrayal of a time, place, or character and a historical account of the same period as a means of understanding how authors of fiction use or alter history.'

It would be a wonderful addition to our Reader’s Workshop Area! In addition, it would be a nice area for the students in my class that need a break from traditional seating.

003fc5865728f67b34e100b83fa8dcbe,Eager Musicians Need Instruments,"When my students pick up an instrument for the first time, they have no idea where it will take them or the joy playing will bring them. They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. Our band program has been expanding so quickly that I do not have enough instruments for my students. Since starting at my school in 2012, the number of students in band has grown from 38 to over 200! This is a great problem to have, but even after years of generous donations by countless individuals, finding affordable used instruments, and borrowing/trading with other schools, we still don't have enough instruments for every student who wants to be in band. These trumpets would mean three students who can't otherwise afford an instrument will be able to participate in band. These instruments will not only give the students that play them an enriching opportunity to learn the trumpet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing one of these trumpets could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music. This project will bring three trumpets into my classroom and into the hands of students who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford this experience. Please help me create an amazing experience for my students!",My students need trumpets in order to support a growing band program.,Music & The Arts,Grades 3-5,Musical Instruments,465.14,Fully Funded
977faa20837851e39393d5befa9982a9,Family Fun Night,"I am the art/recreational therapist at our school. As a member of an incredible staff, I work to include the benefits of liberal arts into each area of studies for our students. On a daily basis, students come to the art room for art projects that are designed just for their needs. Our student population is pulled from nine school districts in Northwest Indiana (with an average of 100-125 students).We provide a full day of services for students who are physically, emotionally and developmentally challenged. Art is such a great process for our students to express themselves. This year we are hosting a 'Family Fun Night.' Hosting students and their families helps bring a sense of belonging. We will be sharing a meal, dancing and have the main event. BOWL MAKING! Students will help their parents/guardians make two bowls from clay. Students become the instructors during a 3-hour event of artistic expression. Students and staff work hard on a daily basis developing our skills as artists at our school. With this event, the students will be able to show/share with others (parents and siblings) what they work on at school during art class. What an amazing opportunity for this joint adventure to be shared. A piece of art that both students and families will have forever. A follow-up activity will be organized, and the bowls will be used during an ice cream social.

248ef49bca01b6d7dfc71c5ffa1bff0c,Vlogging for Struggling Readers and Creative Minds,"Our 6th through 12th grade students are redefining possible at our charter school in Texas. Many come from low-income families and struggle with a variety of issues before they even walk into the classroom. As a Reading Interventionist and the school’s librarian, I’ve seen all of our students embrace a whatever-it-takes attitude to ensure their personal literary growth. Our students are hard-working, determined individuals with a desire to attend college; many would be the first to do so in their family. Our goal as a school is to provide rigorous curriculum, build meaningful student relationships, and provide experiences outside of the classroom as we prepare them for college and beyond. My students don't yet believe they can fall in love with reading, but I am out to prove them wrong! In my reading intervention class, students are anywhere between 1 - 3 grade levels behind in reading, and also struggle with their academic self-confidence knowing they are not as successful in this area. With this video equipment, students will be given a fun, interactive platform that excites them after finishing a short story, a poem, or a full novel. Students will have an opportunity to vlog about their thoughts from the reading material they dive in, summarize the text, or make connections to previous reads. These vlogs are alternative means to current homework that involves writing book reports. Ultimately, this equipment will also be used to start a vlogging club, piloted by my students and supervised by myself as our school's librarian. ","My students need camcorders, tripods, and video equipment to begin vlogging as alternative homework assignments!","Applied Learning, Literacy & Language",Grades 6-8,Instructional Technology,826.41,Fully Funded

Our school culture of perseverance and hard work provides our large student body with the tools and resources to succeed on a daily basis. All of our students, including students with special needs and ESL, are provided with daily instruction using a variety of hands-on, experiential learning opportunities. In addition to classroom instruction, students are provided with a variety of specialties in physical education, visual arts, technology, and music. As the music teacher, I have witnessed a natural passion and enthusiasm, in all of our students, for creating music. They are always ready and eager to fully engage themselves in daily music education. With your help, we can enhance their music education to help them achieve their personal musical goals and dreams!It is well known that music is extremely beneficial to childhood development. Learning to play an instrument, such as the ukulele, provides students with many benefits, which are applied inside and outside of the music classroom. When students learn to play the ukulele, fine motor and coordination skills are developed as students learn strumming and chord patterns. Students develop and build their listening skills as they tune their own instruments and learn to play a variety of songs. When playing in an ensemble, students work collaboratively and collectively, improving their social and emotional skills on a daily basis. In the music classroom, students will compose their own songs, which provides students multiple opportunities for creativity and risk-taking. In my years teaching music, I have seen how music education, in which students sing and play instruments, provides an outlet for creativity and individuality. I have seen my students grow out of shyness and self-doubt, and have seen them blossom into strong, self-aware, performing artists.

However, many of these students have low self-esteem and don't have much confidence in themselves. Their lives are full of personal struggles and limited to almost no recognization or praise, so when these students come to school, I make it my number one priority to make them feel loved, appreciated, and special when they accomplish positive tasks or obligations. I am requesting small toys, treats, prizes, such as stress balls, writing pens and paper, stress-free coloring books, Yo-Yo, play dough, kids stampers, notebooks, activity books, and other items for my treasure box that will be available schoolwide to all students. I am requesting these items for my treasure box because I am the one person that provides prizes and rewards to the entire school for the students. I provide these prizes, treats, and rewards because many of these students do not get the chance or opportunity to celebrate the small but wonderful accomplishments that they make while in school. These small toys, treats, prizes will make a difference in these students lives by lifting their confidence, making them feel worthy, providing them with opportunities to be recognized for being an important part of their school.","My students need rewards, treats, and small toys to help lift their self-esteem and overall emotional well-being!",Special Needs,Grades 3-5,Educational Kits & Games,794.72,Fully Funded
