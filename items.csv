f4842d9369baaf8f5ae34119f09e1b4c,Desperately Need Students to Conduct International Research,"Kids and Culture is a new club we have formed in the past few years. We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past four years, our small initiative has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. This calendar year, a small group of students will be traveling through Spain and Portugal. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the religious influences on art and literature, strengthen their Spanish speaking skills by volunteering with a community center, and compare the traditions, cultures, and cuisine to what they are accustomed to. They will be part of nightly conversations that ask them to reflect on the experience in the moment. Much of their experience will be captured in nightly journals that will be collected. These will assist with their research upon returning. In funding this grant, you give another student the opportunity to travel with us. The total cost covers everything for the student, including transportation, meals, and all activity costs. The research, experience, and life long lessons that are produced from these tours are true testaments to the value of this program. Past students have continued to succeed (100% of alumni are enrolled in four year institutions) and many students have continued their studies with semesters abroad.

We need your help to supply our special education classroom with some working technology to help contribute to the success of our students. Our school district is based in a low income town. Our middle school has a specific program called the Target program. The Target program supports students with emotional disorders. Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly. Our students deserve a chance to interact with today's technology and they deserve to do so in fast and productive manner. If our students have the opportunity to learn 21st century skills, they will be able to practice skills that can be used in their bright futures.

8c8f0bc9fe659b59bc82bcc032894f3c,Freedom of Speech- Public School Students &The First Amendment,"'Tomorrow is Now. It is today that we must create the world of the future.'~Eleanor Roosevelt 'Nothing But the Truth' integrates Civics into the English classroom. My lessons begin by having students explore cases where claims were made that students' first amendment rights were violated. My students are motivated kids who want to learn. This year is a giant transition for them as their middle school was shut down due to budget cuts and they were moved to the local high school where I teach. For the most part, they are the group that represents the above average sector of their grade level, and I believe that researching first amendment court cases and then reading 'Nothing But the Truth' will produce critical thinking and writing from this group. The school they attend is in a lower socioeconomic area where there is little parental involvement. The majority of our school population receives free or reduced lunch. Our district offers free breakfast and most of our students take advantage of this as the free breakfast and free lunch might be all they eat that day. Additionally the students come to me with very little prior or background knowledge of the world outside their community which makes discussion of literature difficult. I will be able to integrate civics into the English classroom by doing a pre-reading activity with the first amendment. Students will understand the first amendment of the constitution as it applies to public school students. They will learn concepts such as advocacy of illegal action, commercial speech, and forum. They will research cases where students' first amendment rights were violated such as Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) where students were suspended for wearing black armbands as a silent protest to the Vietnam War. They will identify the facts of each case, each sides' position, the decision held by the court, and its effect on the country. Students will be grouped by case and will create a digital presentation to share with the class. As a class, we will then read 'Nothing But the Truth' where a student is suspended for humming/singing along to the Star-Spangled Banner instead of standing at silent, respectful attention. We will conclude with a persuasive writing opportunity. Students will have the opportunity to read from books that are new and not falling apart from being used for year after year after year. They won't have to stare at a sticker saying the book belongs to another school that's in a more affluent area because I had to beg and promise favors just to borrow a class set for a limited time. They will know that this class set belongs to OUR classes and they will feel ownership and pride. Most importantly, they will glean real world knowledge.

Today's students live in a global society, and all students deserve the opportunity to explore and experience the world through cultures with which they are unfamiliar. Despite the fact the my students come from an urban environment facing economic and social issues that can bring them an enormous amount of stress, they continue to show that they are dedicated to success at amazing levels. My students are committed to their education in both an academic and personal sense. They seek out opportunities, such as the chance to study the culture of Morocco, in order to learn more about the world they live in and their place in it. These high school students hope to strengthen their understanding of the world as they begin to explore their collegiate opportunities, and plan for their futures. The opportunity for students to experience learning on the international stage has long been relegated to those who are financially able to attain these goals. However, my colleagues and I believe that these experiences should be available to all students. In the months leading up to their trip, my students begin conducting research in various areas of the culture of Morocco. For many students, this is the first time they are able to completely self-direct their learning, focusing on various aspects of culture- from fashion trends and choices, to studying the education system in the country they visit. Students will conclude their research by visiting the country they are studying, gaining the chance to live like a local and to see the world from a new perspective. Students gain the opportunity to grow as individuals and as learners as they gain college credit for their research endeavors. In addition, students have the opportunity to give back. They will be volunteering their time in local communities, participating in activities as diverse as visiting local schools and working with local farmers to better understand the way of life in the country. In funding this grant, you will help to fund the trips of 5 students who are in great economic need. These students will be able to compare their experience in a western nation to the experience of teenagers living in a world vastly different from their own. You will help to instill a love of learning that will carry these students through their academic careers at the university level, as well as in their professional endeavors.

My adorable dragons continue to excel and grow through reading. This is only one way I can continue to help them thrive and grow. I cannot even begin to express what 'Storyworks' will allow me to integrate in the classroom, or the benefits it will bestow upon my students, but I will give it my best shot. As we have rolled out Common Core Standards, it has been challenging to find resources and text to support our lessons. As I stumbled upon a copy of 'Storyworks,' it has enhanced my teaching significantly. I am able to teach complex text in a wide range of genres, share thrilling narrative non-fiction text, original fiction, bring historical events to life through readers theater, explore classic and contemporary poetry, as well as support each one of my students at their individual levels.

Students need many experiences with reading books and other materials. These durable book holders will allow my students a special place to keep the books they are reading.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life. They are healthier emotionally and intellectually. When you're a reader, anything is possible. Please help our students realize this.

I work in a Title 1 School that has a wonderful group of dedicated staff believing every child can learn. The majority of students are coming from a financially challenging backgrounds. The students, even though they have challenges at home, are happy to come to school and determined to participate in learning. In today's technology, fast paced, standards-based driven educational world, the demands on students as learners is higher than ever. However, in my particular classroom (and many other classrooms in my building), the students are knowledge hungry and not afraid to struggle to improve their learning. The students in my room need to read a variety of complex texts for multiple purposes. The students also need to find evidence to support their learning. Having the evidence kits will help my students read nonfiction and fiction text while being able to find key details, compare and contrast, summarize,discuss vocabulary and find the theme for multiple grade level texts. During the school day, we will use white boards for multiple reasons and in multiple subject areas. With the white boards the students can practice their work and show their thinking. Students also hold up white boards in whole group lessons so the teacher can get a snapshot of learning and understanding to provide more intense intervention/small group time when needed.

In our classroom alone we speak 5 different languages and call several countries home. My students are diverse in socioeconomic background and home environments. Many students do not have Internet access at home, and some live in a mobile home community. I have several gifted and talented students eager to create and learn. Although they come from various backgrounds, one thing they have in common is their enthusiasm to learn. They are an energetic, and a very gracious group. Dash & Dot robots are hands-on learning tools that teach creativity, problem solving, and coding to children. Children can see their code come to life in a real-world, hands-on way that engages them fully in the concepts they are learning about. As robotics and computers become increasingly prevalent in students’ lives, understanding programming concepts is becoming very important for students’ success. Students will work in small groups to develop their collaboration and communication abilities as they learn valuable 21st century skills. Help my students get introduced to STEM early and cultivate their skills for the opportunities of today’s world. The possibilities are endless for these robots and I can’t wait to use them in all subject areas to enrich my student’s learning. My students live in a rural part of our county and many are on free and reduced lunch. Many of them do not have the opportunity to learn through through technology, let alone robots, at home. I want to give them opportunities to learn and grow and develop real world skills. I want all of my students, especially my female students, to feel inspired in the field of science and technology.

Our school culture of perseverance and hard work provides our large student body with the tools and resources to succeed on a daily basis. All of our students, including students with special needs and ESL, are provided with daily instruction using a variety of hands-on, experiential learning opportunities. In addition to classroom instruction, students are provided with a variety of specialties in physical education, visual arts, technology, and music. As the music teacher, I have witnessed a natural passion and enthusiasm, in all of our students, for creating music. They are always ready and eager to fully engage themselves in daily music education. With your help, we can enhance their music education to help them achieve their personal musical goals and dreams!It is well known that music is extremely beneficial to childhood development. Learning to play an instrument, such as the ukulele, provides students with many benefits, which are applied inside and outside of the music classroom. When students learn to play the ukulele, fine motor and coordination skills are developed as students learn strumming and chord patterns. Students develop and build their listening skills as they tune their own instruments and learn to play a variety of songs. When playing in an ensemble, students work collaboratively and collectively, improving their social and emotional skills on a daily basis. In the music classroom, students will compose their own songs, which provides students multiple opportunities for creativity and risk-taking. In my years teaching music, I have seen how music education, in which students sing and play instruments, provides an outlet for creativity and individuality. I have seen my students grow out of shyness and self-doubt, and have seen them blossom into strong, self-aware, performing artists.

However, many of these students have low self-esteem and don't have much confidence in themselves. Their lives are full of personal struggles and limited to almost no recognization or praise, so when these students come to school, I make it my number one priority to make them feel loved, appreciated, and special when they accomplish positive tasks or obligations. I am requesting small toys, treats, prizes, such as stress balls, writing pens and paper, stress-free coloring books, Yo-Yo, play dough, kids stampers, notebooks, activity books, and other items for my treasure box that will be available schoolwide to all students. I am requesting these items for my treasure box because I am the one person that provides prizes and rewards to the entire school for the students. I provide these prizes, treats, and rewards because many of these students do not get the chance or opportunity to celebrate the small but wonderful accomplishments that they make while in school. These small toys, treats, prizes will make a difference in these students lives by lifting their confidence, making them feel worthy, providing them with opportunities to be recognized for being an important part of their school.","My students need rewards, treats, and small toys to help lift their self-esteem and overall emotional well-being!",Special Needs,Grades 3-5,Educational Kits & Games,794.72,Fully Funded

We are fortunate that we are one of the few one to one laptop classrooms in our school which allows us to incorporate technology in all subjects. We are a STEAM Academy where the focus is on science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. Most of my students are low income and don't have the ability to use technology at home. They are are coming from the surrounding areas to attend a school that is often times better than their neighborhood school. Las Vegas also tends to have a very transient population, and many kids are constantly moving either into, out of, or around the city. As our classroom technology becomes outdated we need to continuously update our technology to provide learning opportunities for our students. We have several schoolwide programs such as ST math, Reading Plus, and Star Reading that require access to the internet. The Chromebooks will be used several times throughout the day to access our schoolwide programs and to create online projects. As we are teaching 21st-century skills such as coding the students need technology that can keep pace with the skills they are learning. Having access to technology that is updated and current help students complete projects quicker and improves their experience using technology.",My students need four Asus Chromebooks to replace outdated classroom technology.,"Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades 3-5,Computers & Tablets,2531.05,Live
