The leveled readers we have are very short and most of my readers have already read them multiple times. Chapter books, please! My students are becoming excellent readers. I think that may be my favorite part of this job so far, watching them grow. At this point in the year they have shown so much growth! I cannot let them be held back by our selection of books. It is my job to challenge them, and make sure they have all of the necessary materials to do excellent things with their lives. Some of them have never read chapter books before and that accomplishment alone is something that they are proud of. I want them to excel, be proud of their accomplishments and become amazing readers. Please help me do this for them! The titles that I have requested are from some of my favorite book series from when I was a child. Of course, I added some suggestions from my little ones, but most of you will remember reading these books! The Magic School Bus, Henry and Mudge, Amelia Bedelia, these are just a few of the series that are included in this project. Reading can be fun, and it is especially fun when readers get to follow a character through multiple books. I want to share that fun with my students. My students have been so inspired by the donations that we have received so far from DonorsChoose.org. They even wanted to start their own 'giving tree' bulletin board to track the ways that our class can help others because we have been helped so much. Not only is your funding helping them grow academically but your generosity shows them that there is good in the world, and a lot of it. Thank you for everything that you do. You have already taught my students a wonderful lesson.

1e69d5ea8f4d653b409b57734243e0d9,Learning through Light,"My super scholars are always investigating the world around them but they don't live in communities where they can easily learn about science. Many of my students live in neighborhoods where they cant go outside and take a walk and they don't have opportunities to go to a museum. My students are active explorers. I teach prekindergarten in a public school in Washington, DC. My students are always asking inquisitive questions and I know they yearn to understand the world around them but I do not have enough resources in my classroom to teach them everything I would like them to learn. We live in a society where science isn't always the priority but it is a subject matter that I not only want to be a priority in my classroom but I want to make it fun and interesting for my young scientists. The resources I am asking for include a light table and various materials my students can explore with the light table. These resources will help my students learn about how light affects what we see and they can have a clearer picture of how light affects things differently. My project is so important because I am asking for materials that have endless uses in my classroom. A light table can be used to teach my students about science but can also be altered to teach literacy or be used for an art project.

ba4d9406a4977793d971716bb842bf9f,Making Mathematicians Out Of Kinder Kids!,"Math can be challenging and frustrating for young children in Kindergarten. Without interactive tools and games, my students have a hard time visualizing math in the real world. We need the resources to build on students basic number sense and problem solving. I work at a Title 1 School where 70% of our students are free and reduced lunch. They are enthusiastic learners who need the basic fundamentals to succeed in Kindergarten and enrich their love of school. My students are ready for new challenges and enjoy learning. Most of my students have not had the opportunity to work with math manipulative's or played games that facilitate learning. My students come into the school year with little knowledge of what math is, how we use it everyday, and basic number sense. It is my job to get my kindergarten students loving school, so they continue on their path to a higher education. Math can be very frustrating to young students and it is my goal to find games, tools, and resources to encourage students to love math! The resources I have chosen are hands-on, interactive, and promote basic problem solving skills. The use of mathematical stations help each student independently problem solve, work with others to explain their mathematical thinking, and engage the students in game-like centers that promote learning. Puzzles not only promote logical and mathematical reasoning, but also fine motor skills. The writing tablets will help the students write numerals and explain their thinking while developing number formation. The various learning centers will help the students build confidence in explaining their thinking with peers in small groups, and have them show their mathematical knowledge. Students gain information through hands-on learning centers because they are physically manipulating the tools to help them problem solve. Another great advantage is teaching the students how to explain their thinking using math language and build their own oral language among their peers. My students are extremely enthusiastic about math, but it can become frustrating to work through mathematical problems. I need the resources and manipulative's to help my students strengthen their confidence in basic problem solving, explain their thinking, and build their math language. Throughout their education, children must explain their reasoning, and these resources will help students to naturally progress in explaining how they found a solution and how math is important to everyday life!

These are some of the best words I could hear from my students during center time! In wanting their love for books to grow, I want to give them another way to listen and enjoy books! My classroom is a Tittle 1, Head Start Preschool/Pre-K mixed aged classroom. They started as a rambunctious group excited to do anything in school and have grown into deeper learners these last few months. Now that their love for school and learning is growing, I know I need to set them up for success, especially with their pre-literacy and mathematics skills. Finding a way to foster their excitement for learning as well as their social/emotional growth in a play-based environment is my main job! We have so many children wanting an adult to read books to them, it has become challenging to meet all of the student's needs during this critical learning time. With no listening center currently, the children are frustrated when they cannot read the stories on their own. By giving them a way to listen to books in a more independent way, we can allow each child to grow their love for reading. In addition, children will develop their listening skills, their abilities to follow directions (page turning signals), and their social skills by reading with a friend! Looking at the data for the student population in our area is one of the most disheartening things I can do. But it is also the best reminder of why I am doing what I do each day; setting up my students for the best possible educational future! Having a listening center is one key way I can give my students a better start in reading and we thank you tremendously for supporting our learning!

b8c67cd6680b1d324ed5bbbcb20b8021,Pre-K Listening Center,"One of the biggest determinants of success in their academic career is exposure to fluent reading at an early age. A classroom listening center is the perfect way to provide my students with this opportunity and further develop their emergent reading skills. My students, all either four or five years old, are in Pre-Kindergarten at a public, inner-city school in Washington, DC. They are an energetic, enthusiastic group who are eager to learn. Though they are at different stages in their literary development, they all love and appreciate books and enjoy being read to. I am requesting a complete listening station for the classroom literacy center. This station will include a CD player, set of headphones, junction box and a storage unit to keep things organized (we already have sets of books with corresponding CDs). This listening center will ensure that all 20 students will have access to individual reading instruction, which is critical as they embark on the initial stage of the multi-year process of becoming fluent readers. Exposure to fluent reading on an individual or group basis during morning reading, center time, or free choice will help students gain access to books, recognize letters, make letter-sound connections, recognize site words and aid in comprehension. Furthermore, this will instill my students with a sense of confidence that they are reading the book along with the recorded reader. Additionally, the listening center will foster productive interaction with technology and further develop their fine motor skills. A listening center will be a wonderful addition to the classroom. Your donation to this project will greatly impact the lives of my students and no amount is too small. Each student will have access to the listening center a minimum of 2-3 times per week which will aid in the development of their emergent reading skills.

c317d493ad9814e7a840785ab4cbbbd3,Inner-City Puppet Theater,"Our art room houses several iterations of visual art. 1st and 2nd hour is usually basic Art 1 and 2. 3rd hour is usually Video Production. By 4th hour we are either doing Digital Photography, Graphic Design or Art Appreciation/Art History. 7th hour is the new and experimental Puppet Making class. My students are from Flint, MI and the surrounding counties. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. Many of my students come from poverty stricken areas and households. This is the single factor that most of my students have in common. We are about 85% free and reduced lunches. Many come from violent environments, broken and unstable home environments. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. Students who are openly homosexual, pregnant, extremely intelligent, or socially awkward make up a large portion of the student body. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to extremely empathetic to others. We pride ourselves in being involved in our community! The two items I am requesting are specifically for our new puppet theater that we are starting this year. We will be producing both indoor and outdoor productions. The puppets will range in size from 3 feet to parade style puppets which are sometimes up to 20 feet. Our first show will be this December. It is about dreams. The show will combine live puppetry, shadow puppetry, video, live music, recorded music, lighting, sound design, narration and a smoke machine I hope! Our main puppets are in the style of Japanese Bunraku puppets as well as European Marionette Portee style puppets. This means that the puppets are very high in artistic style and creativity. These are not Muppet style. Most of the puppets will take 3 students to operate. One for the head and arm, one for the back and other arm and one for the legs. Since we will be utilizing video and overhead projections as well as live music, narration and sound effects we are in desperate need of a movie screen and a sound system. Our intention is for our students to be able to tell stories relevant to their lives. Puppets are a great way for our particular student body to express themselves in a unique way. Controlling a puppet also takes some of the stigma of performance away from an otherwise nervous young actor. Helping to support our Puppet Theater will directly impact the lives of hundreds of inner-city youth and their families but also the wider Flint community.

We perform concerts with our beginner and two advanced bands. We rehearse daily and strive for the highest! My students are passionate, hard workers. The band is made up of about 170 members. Even though 96.7 percent are economically disadvantaged, these students deserve a chance to experience the best education and musical experience they can get! We are an inner city school. Our band students will use these reeds literally everyday that they are performing. Without these reeds, the band would not be able to create music! Our clarinet, bass clarinet, and saxophone students will be using them from the beginner level through the last concert of their 8th grade year!The joy and education of learning a musical instrument should not be under-valued.

Last year they watched in anticipation as the art classes created masterpieces and now it is finally their turn to show the world what they've got! My students are devoted to the school mission to 'Redefine Possible'. Almost all of the students in our school will be first generation college graduates and we work toward achieving that goal every day. Before enrolling in 6th grade, each student signs a college commitment contract with the school committing to eight long years of putting 100% every day to the goal of getting to and through college. Every day my students show tenacity to reach this goal, take for example this art course where my students are completing a high school credit in the 8th grade. As the first art course that many of them have completed, they relish the chance to tell their personal story through art. Thanks to your donation, we can create unbelievable works of art! This project includes classroom supplies for many of the projects that we will complete in the classroom this year. The canvas panels will be used for our painting unit at the end of this semester where each student will recreate Van Gogh's masterpiece, Starry Night, but with their own twist. This semester ends with the most meaningful painting project, the self portrait, where the art students find a way to depict both their inner and outer self using art. The watercolor paper will be used for a Georgia O'Keeffe inspired watercolor painting in the spring. Finally, the easy cut boards will be used for a printing project. Last year the printing project was a huge hit and students are still talking about it today! Funding this project will allow my students to experience a large variety of art mediums throughout their Art I course curriculum. Without canvas, watercolor paper and printing blocks my students wouldn't get the chance to see all of the possible ways they can create art. For most of them, art is drawing with colored pencils.

Right now a typical day involves learning movement, breath and teamwork, building practice puppets, sculpting heads, making masks, painting props, paper mache work and more. My students come from all walks of life. Our school accepts students from the entire county and we have a very high percentage of students from inner-city Flint. Our school truly has a diverse population. Our city has been hit hard with poverty and that does transfer into the classroom in many forms. My students tend to be quite creative but lack the experience of having the arts offered at their previous schools. They can be challenging, hilarious, smart, caring, empathetic and kind. One thing that does set our school apart is our commitment and involvement in the community. We have a great reputation in our town. We are considered an alternative to a traditional high school. This means that we have many non-traditional students, students that do not fit your typical mold. We are an early college and a middle college. Students start taking college in their 9th grade year and stay a 5th year in order to get more college credits and a potential Associates degree. With a lighting system we will be able to present our high school puppet theatre called 'Fli-Town Puppet Theatre'. We need lights to be able to present the atmosphere that is needed for a puppet show to be truly engaging, artistic, dramatic and fun. Our puppet theatre is new this year. One thing that is important to us is to be able to be portable. We want to share our shows with our community as well as other schools. The lighting system that we are trying to get funded is light, portable, isn't hot and dangerous, and is made up of new technology that is beneficial for our students, especially if they are planning to get into any part of entertainment or theatre. They will learn how to focus lights, change colors, fade in and out, design a lighting set up for specific spaces. They will learn what it means to be a gaffer, a technician, the artistry around lighting design, power, electricity and more. And of course what it means to put on a play and present puppets to our community. If we are able to get our project funded it will directly impact our ability to present a high quality theatrical puppet play. Our puppet theatre does not use a traditional Muppet style puppet. We are making European style puppets mixed with traditional Japanese Bunraku style. This means we have 2 to 3 students controlling each puppet. For them to come to life we need a controlled lighting set up to allow us to camouflage our actors on stage bringing attention to the puppets themselves.

Alice WalkerMy students come alive through the beautification of our school through gardening. As a veteran teacher at my high school, I wondered if beauty affected the learning process. This year I found out. I had an idea in my environmental science class. The students supported and jumped right in. Most come from broken homes and impoverished neighborhoods. Often times, school is the place where they can get away from their realities at home. Our school would be the perfect escape if they had something to look forward to. Our class is filled with seniors whom have yet to see their school at it's peak of success. There is a need for that success. As a teacher I wish for my students to bask in the beauty of awesomeness. I wish for them to start a legacy that will be passed on. I wish for them to return to their home and see how they have contributed to the success of their community. This starts with the beautification of our campus. Someone once planted some roses in our courtyards. The roses have not reached their full potential. Students will learn how to prune and care for our roses to make them thrive. We currently started a vegetable garden in a courtyard and used old planters in another area of our school to continue planting. We have been walking our water hose from one side of campus to another. A hose cart would be the perfect tool to make this process more efficient. Our water nozzle has broken and we are in need of another. We have been manipulating the water as it comes out of the hose by placing our thumb on the end of the spout. We are desperately in need of outdoor gardening soil and or manure. Our ground is not fertile. Students will learn the elements needed in soil to create a sustainable growing environment for plants and vegetables. They will also be able to participate in soil testing labs. Knowing that anonymous people are investing in their efforts will help change their attitudes toward people in life. The beautification of our school through gardening will allow the students to gain the hands on experience in agricultural studies. This will also be the catalyst of projects to come and future partnerships for our school as we move forward.

I am so excited that our best musicians will be able to compete in multiple concerts and competitions! These children have so much talent, hope, and desire to be the best, and have dreams for their future to be contributing and supportive members of society. I believe they can! Imagine a musical group looking groomed and fervently desiring to provide music that creates joy and awe! The elite musicians from my classes have been selected and have been diligently practicing difficult music for the upcoming UIL competition. The skills they have mastered from learning to read music, to the discipline they have learned from consistent practice, are life-long skills that are needed in life and any career. Learning the persistence and patience to be successful is a critical skill. Performing together in a well versed team is another critical skill. Feeling respected, valued, and honored is an extra bonus that comes from being in a competing wind ensemble group and is only complete with a great uniform. The students have the desire, hope, talent, and matching vests to create a beginning for looking polished. Matching dress shirts for under the vests are the missing touch that will make a difference in their look and feelings of pride.

The kids will look and sound like one million bucks! When we go to our next competition, looking like a group playing a professional concert, the kids perform different. They feel different about themselves. They come from extreme poverty, homelessness, broken families, and do not have the resources to better themselves or their appearance. Every time we are able to provide them with new resources we see a change in how they think about themselves, and what they can accomplish. Help our kids feel like the winners they are!

783e9ce8b695057e2d45d28234217cac,Urban Puppet Theatre Supplies,"Each day our students come into class and begin the process of discovery. Puppetry includes engineering, technology, sound design, lighting, music, movement, acting, mathematics, fine art, teamwork, prop making, mask making and many forms of experimentation in the form of design and performance My students are from Flint, MI and the surrounding counties. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. Many of my students come from poverty stricken areas and households. This is the single factor that most of my students have in common. We are about 85% free and reduced lunches. Many come from violent environments, broken and unstable home environments. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. When I get my students in 9th grade the majority have not had an art class since they were very young. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to extremely empathetic to others and we pride ourselves in being heavily involved in our community! With the addition of foam and foam cutting tools my students will be able to design and build light weight puppet bodies. Having a designated tool box for the puppet building class will aid in my students being able to engineer and build props and puppets. We will utilize the clay and clay tools to sculpt heads and body parts for molding and casting. We will utilize heat guns for softening thermoplastics to be used to create masks and puppet heads. Through the process of puppet building and performance my students learn techniques in painting, sculpting, casting, mask making, prop building, music and sound design, anatomy, movement, lighting, set design, acting, choreography, teamwork but also STEM skills (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). These skills transfer into many disciplines and potential job opportunities. We are making professional quality puppets in our class. This means that we use professional tools and supplies that can get expensive. We have some financial support from our school system and PTSO but adding these extra items will create a thriving environment in the room. This will improve the classroom by allowing my students to have ample supplies to really experiment and dive deep into what is possible in terms of puppet design using the proper professionally standard tools and supplies.

The children that I work with daily are so eager to learn and put forth so much effort. It is my goal to get these children to reach their educational goals In our building, we have the philosophy 'everyone gets what everyone needs.' We incorporate a MTSS framework that targets all students K-5, which ensures that all students are getting what they need in order to be successful at school. I currently have 14 students on my caseload. Disabilities range from Specific Learning Disabilities, to Emotional Impairments, to Other Health Impairments. Each student is working out of interventions to target their reading and math needs. Despite their large educational gap, these children are so eager to learn and be the best they can be. Children always get so excited when able to get their hands on new technology. Having iPads will enhance my students reading and math skills. They will be able to take what they've learned within our interventions and be able to generalize while doing different activities. There are apps that are tied directly to our math intervention, the iPads would allow my students to get extra practice and learn new skills while working with technology. Using iPads would also allow my students to have the feeling of independence. They need so much extra support throughout the day, being able to utilize different apps at their level would make them feel much more confident! Every student can learn, it just may not be on the same day, or in the same way. I'm hoping that with extra learning opportunities tied to technology, I will be able to close up the learning gap that my students currently have. Each child has a different learning style and pace. I believe that each and every child is capable of learning and succeeding. ",My students need iPads to further their learning when it comes to reading and math.

We, as a school, are working very hard to get them on or above grade level. This is a big challenge, but we care about the students' futures. Technology will help us get there! My students are great! We are always working on a classroom environment where everyone feels loved, valued, and respected. They work hard at school despite some challenges that may be at home. A lot of my students come from the Flint area, which means that running water would be a luxury for them. My students have so much potential to make a big difference in this world, and we are trying our best, as a school, to help them see that. Our school not only cares for our students but also their family and community. Technology is sparse at our school because our Title 1 money is spent on interventionists because our students are coming to us way below grade level. We recently received one iPad from another DonorsChoose.org project, and my students have loved every second of it. If we could have another one in our classroom, we could double the students that could use it. We will be using the iPad in a lot of areas but really focusing on reading and math. My students will be reading a wide variety of books which brings the library to them. My students will also be building their basic math knowledge that is the foundation of math to come. My students like to know that people care. When I told them we had received an iPad for our classroom, they were so excited. I'd love to share that we got another one. Being able to incorporate technology into their foundational reading and math skills is important. Technology is the future, and it helps students relate to the material being presented. My students will be able to have a library that has thousands of books at their finger tips. My students will also experience math in a fun way!

I also serve a split level classroom this year with first and second grade students. Students love that difference in the approach for learning. Doing something other than sitting at a desk in a chair. Students have an opportunity with the fun chairs, a bench, and mats to lay on and just enjoy reading. At a young age it is so very important to children to love learning or in this case love reading. I would love to be able to create that space for them here. As we work on independent learners, I want them to be comfortable; and these materials/furniture will help my students with that.
