I am sure it is not the old, hard, heavy chair that my students need to use every day. I teach third grade in a very low-income neighborhood in California with 100% of my students receiving free or reduced meals and 90% are English language learners. It is a very diverse population with Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Indian, and Black students. Many of the students are considered high-risk due to the conditions in which they live (gangs, violence, and drugs). They are also the most charming and eager students anyone could hope to meet. My students thrive in an atmosphere that is consistent, fair, and filled with many opportunities to express themselves Imagine going to work every day and having to sit in old, hard, heavy chairs. It is not a comfortable learning environment for students. They spend more than half their school day sitting in these chairs. The Virco Zuma chairs are comfortable, light weight, ergonomically designed with the student in mind, and the cool cantilever shape makes sitting down fun! When children are sitting correctly, they can spend their energies focused on learning rather than on finding a more comfortable way to place their bodies. These ergonomically styled chairs will help this year's class learn in a comfortable environment as well as many futures classes to come.

Using whiteboards individually helps each student practice standards and skills to be successful in 1st grade. The whiteboards will help them quickly practice without wasting a lot of paper. The children in my district come from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. All the children have the desire to learn. Some, do not have the family support necessary to encourage success.

My students need double-sided whiteboards to create an enriching classroom learning environment. The white boards we have currently are ones that I have made. They are white construction paper put into a see-through sleeve. These homemade whiteboards are very flimsy and do not last long. If our class has the hard-back whiteboards, they would last for a very long time and we would be able to practice standards and skills learned throughout the day. Students will use the lined side of the whiteboard to practice writing words or short responses. Students will use the blank side to brainstorm or complete mathematical equations. These whiteboards will ensure that all students are actively learning and participating in whole group lessons as well as practicing during their independent time. Please help us get our whiteboards! I can assure you that this would be an educational tool that would get its use in our classroom. My students this year and many years to come will utilize them daily.

It sounds silly, but I thought, 'Okay, the way the world works can be changed.'' Jay Silver We want our students, who are learning about how the world works, to understand that their ideas can bring about powerful change. We live in a community with a mixture of low-economic families and middle-class families. Many students have limited English, but they work very hard. Their parents are very supportive and work with their children to ensure success in school. Our students are bright and motivated. They enjoy learning about and using new technology. They amaze us with their ideas and willingness to persevere when faced with a problem. Our students have been creating products digitally, and we are ready to go to the next level and use the skills they have learned to have an object come to life. We think the best way to get started is with the Lego Robotics kit. Students will then be able to design and create a robot of any style and with any function. Seeing their designs come to life will allow our students to experience a true 21st century classroom. The skills students will acquire by learning to use a true robotics kit will help them throughout their school career and into the workforce. We want to provide an environment where creative ideas can be nurtured and developed and the students' ideas can come to life. Our students have brilliant ideas.

All of our students have hearing loss, ranging from mild to profound. In addition, some of our students also have other disabilities including autism, cognitive delays, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy. Many of our students enter preschool with almost no language. They do not know how to communicate their wants and needs to adults or peers. As Teachers of the Deaf, we rely heavily on pictures and visual aids to introduce very basic vocabulary. It is our job to help our students learn to communicate with us, their families, and the outside world. This can be either through sign language, assisted sign, oral communication or a mixture of these modes of communication. Our preschool team would like to purchase one iPad for every classroom.

In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the TEACHER is most important.' I could not agree more. As a third grade teacher and life-long learner, I encourage my students to explore and go beyond the walls of our classroom. My class of 13 boys and 11 girls is a lively one. This group of children is first kind and cooperative with one another. They set their personal academic goals, and respect individual starting points knowing our class objective is growth for all. Our school and district is quaint and clean. It is full of caring parents, staff, teachers, and administrators. We are not a wealthy district or community, but we make do. The kids greet me at the door each morning with a handshake and smile. They come ready to learn, yet teach me something new each day!The technology available to the students is limited and outdated. This restricts both my ability and theirs with regard to exposing and exploring all the wonderful things that lie beyond our little school, district, and community. Technology is not the be-all and end-all of education, but it can provide children with experiences that they might not otherwise have growing up in a small somewhat rural town. I am seeking an iPad with a protective case for my classroom. The protective case with 24 third graders is self-explanatory, but let me share with you the purpose of the iPad. Technology of today has opened the door to more resources than one can imagine for adults and children alike. On a daily basis, my children would be able to utilize various online literacy and math programs which are not available to them outside of the school. These programs support the struggling student, the 'average' student, as well as the student who is ready for the next step in their education. Having an iPad would allow more children the chance to engage in these learning opportunities. More importantly, an iPad in our classroom would provide children with the ability to listen to books while following along. This will build fluency, as well as expose the children to a wider variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction with their specific needs and interests taken into account. The addition of an iPad to our two classroom computers (each over two decades old) will not revolutionize my teaching, as I believe what Bill Gates has said, 'Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is most important.' However, I also believe your model of generosity and kindness will make a difference in my students' lives. To know there are people in the world who care about both children and education is powerful. Thank you.

I have a small room that serves as an office and treatment space for children with communication deficits. My approach is to directly teach children the communication skill they need and then allow for practice and carryover through play with peers. My school has a wide variety of programs ranging from severely disabled students in both primary and secondary life skills classrooms, to the district level gifted program, in addition to a K-5 regular education elementary program. My caseload includes students with autism, selective mutism, intellectual disability, language disorders, and developmental delays. My project is specifically designed for those students with autism and selective mutism. I work with them directly on social communication skills which is very stressful and difficult for them. Many of them dislike school due to the anxiety caused by having to communicate with peers and adults. I have had success with having them come into the speech room with a buddy or two and complete puzzles, play board games or build with Lego's. My supply, however, is quite low and I am in need of a bigger variety of high interest puzzle and building toys to keep their engagement and enthusiasm up as well as their peers. With the addition of the puzzles and magnetic toys I've requested, my students will have more choices of what they can do with their speech buddies. The few items that I have used to date have allowed one of my students with significant anxiety related to autism and selective mutism to begin to build friendships with two other boys in his class. He is able to practice looking at others when he speaks, asking questions, initiating conversation, and being flexible when interacting with others. His mother reports that he no longer fights coming to school because he has something to look forward to every day before lunch. This project will allow my students to practice their communication skills, make friends and have fun while working on speech, social communication, problem solving, and language skills.

They come from broken families, or parents who work multiple jobs just to pay rent. It is hard for them to continue their learning at home because parents are working hard to make ends meet, or they simply don't have any materials to work with. Due to this fact, many of them are below grade level, and struggling to get caught up. To help my students, we work in small groups on a regular basis.

Students don't have space to put all of their materials, much less enough space to put their arms on the table and write comfortably. With this new table, there will be enough space to seat eight students. Plus, the table is scalloped, so each student has their own area.

69e235927bc6a5c7dd65e45a8506dc73,A Kind Circle of Friends,"A classroom that is full of smiles, communication, collaboration, creativity, and laughter is a classroom where learning is taking place! Receiving round tables for our classroom will allow my students endless opportunities to complete individual and collaborative activities daily. Putting the fun and love of learning back into the classroom is the ultimate goal of every teacher. Over the years I have watched the kindergarten curriculum increase in its educational requirements as the common core standards for students leaving kindergarten have soared to very high heights for our youngest learners. The curriculum lessons and expectations for reading, writing, and math, provide little time to focus on the importance of the 4C’s of learning (collaboration, cooperation, creativity, and communication). My goal is to provide my 24 students with every opportunity to engage in the 4C’s of learning by providing them with collaborative furniture and creative learning materials that will guide them through their educational journey in a positive and caring way. Our youngest learners are eager to learn, I simply want to design a positive learning environment that will help make their educational journey enjoyable. Adding round spacious and comfortable tables to the classroom will allow the students to work both independently and collaboratively. Students will have their own space to keep their materials better organized which will help make their learning endeavors more productive and successful. In addition, the round collaborative feel of the tables will also allow many opportunities for the students during group activities to communicate with each other and create collaborative projects. As an educator, these tables will give me the opportunity to monitor my students more efficiently and effectively during both individual and group time activities. Providing opportunities to become a team member throughout the school day and work collaboratively with peers is always a win-win situation. Donations towards this project will help provide a positive learning environment that focuses on the importance of social growth and educational happiness. My goal is to help my students learn how to work cooperatively with their classmates and will allow them the ability to use their positive communication skills not only in school, but throughout their lives. These tables will help make collaboration more attainable and will make it easier for my students to work together as a team.

I work with students in grades K-12 that have serious medical issues such as cancer. They all live in high poverty areas. It is a joy and a privilege to work with these students. Some students have life threatening conditions such as cancer. Other students are on the transplant list waiting for an organ transplant. A few students have been hit by a car or were in a car accident. Most of the students experience pain on a daily basis. All of my students are very brave and are a pleasure to work with. In addition to their serious medical problems, all of my students reside in high poverty areas. Most of my students come from single parent families. The families are in need and spend a majority of their time taking their children to medical appointments and to the hospital. My students need a laminator, art supplies, paper, various writing materials, and mailing envelopes so they can create projects to share with others in the world. Our school lacks basic supplies. With these supplies the students will be able to use hands-on learning in their lessons. Students will create projects, mail them and share them electronically with others around the world. They can post them in the hospital to bring joy and encouragement to others! Since my students are under a great deal of stress and most of the students have chronic pain due to a serious medical conditions, integrating art and hands-on learning into our academic lessons is necessary. Project based learning helps students develop critical thinking skills. The families love to see the books and projects the students' create. Laminating the projects helps families battling cancer save the students' precious work forever! We share the projects with the community and families. We create research presentations. This helps to develop students' critical thinking and analysis skills. We integrate math, art, technology, english and science concepts. Students create sophisticated writing and research projects. Students write books and letters. Brave students battling cancer inspire others with their work. Students can save these projects forever!

The best learning occurs when students have the chance to collaborate with their peers. Throughout the day I have the opportunity to work with 96 students. Due to increase class sizes, we have had the opportunity to use a second classroom. This classroom currently has a wide variety of left over desks and tables that were left over from other schools in our district. While this works, it is not an ideal learning environment. Students sit at desks of different shapes and sizes that do not best allow for group work. We are looking to create a classroom environment that is truly inviting to all students. We hope to arrange our classroom so that students can easily collaborate with one another on projects and academic tasks. These tables will allow us to work with students in a more collaborative manner. Our goal is to help facilitate students in a way so that they can learn from one another. In sixth grade, it's extremely important that students have the chance to interact with one another to complete academic tasks. Students need just as much practice working with one another as they do on their math skills. These tables will allow students to easily collaborate with each other throughout the school day. Table tops provide a much needed workspace while also providing the students a more structured way to learn from one another.

What if you needed a tissue for your runny nose...but had to use toilet paper or a paper towel? Healthy and happy kids make for bright and healthy learners. My students come from a very low socioeconomic status rural area in North Dakota. Little things, like getting a tissue when their nose is runny, or counting the minutes until lunch because the last time they ate something substantial was the day before school, plague my students on a daily basis. It is difficult for them to focus on their studies and learning when they are dealing with rumbly tummies. Most of my students do not even have essentials such as Kleenex or pencils to use during class. I want to distribute the snack during my reading group in the morning. This will tide the students over until lunch time so they can focus on their reading, and not their tummies. A vacuum, hand sanitizer, and cleaning wipes will help ensure my students will stay healthy throughout the school year. Little things such as Kleenex, pencils, and a paper sharpener are things my students wish they had on a daily basis. My students will become become better learners and will be able to focus when their normal, everyday, daily needs are being met. The students will be able to focus on reading and vocabulary, and not on growling tummies and pencils. The student's lives will be tremendously affected by this donation. Students have a really hard time focusing on reading when they are worried about how far away lunch is. Students will be able to not worry about the inability to have sharpened pencils during class time when they know they will have access to one in the classroom. A clean classroom not only keeps students healthy, but it will keep moral and general attitude positive.

We have become a Google classroom and we use the technology to the best of our ability. The addition of an iPad will allow my students to video and research when they need it, instead of just when we are scheduled to have the media cart. Students often struggle understanding the concept of molecular makeup and atomic structure. If students are able to build models of these difficult concepts they will gain a better understanding of these benchmarks. The chemistry kits will allow a hands-on approach that will greatly benefit kinesthetic learners and visual learners alike. Students learn by doing and these kits allow students to create molecular structures and atomic models.
