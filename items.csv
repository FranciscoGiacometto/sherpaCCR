b94e64a19c9d26503d5470ce8fe4fd19,Cooking in the Functional Skills Class,"Do you remember learning to cook your first meal? My students will be adults in the next few years, but have had few opportunities to learn appropriate cooking skills. I teach a class for students with moderate to severe disabilities. My students all attend a public school and spend some time in a special education setting and some time with their typical peers. They have a wide range of skill levels and abilities, but they are all on a functional life skills curriculum, meaning their goals in school are to learn basic skills required to navigate life. With the addition of cooking supplies, including a skillet, a griddle, a crock pot, and kitchen utensils, my students will have the opportunity to learn to make and/or assist in making simple meals. We will be able to make a wide array of foods traditionally cooked on a stovetop including pancakes, tacos, and spaghetti. They will also be given the opportunity to try new foods that they have not tasted in the past, broadening their food preferences through experience. By donating to this project, you are helping my students learn skills that will last them throughout their life. My students will be able to learn some basic cooking skills and try new, delicious foods that they've never tried before. Please consider donating to this project.

d3366a35ce7ad4ff022b11b6877364c8,Reading with Meaning...Let's Take A Closer Look!,"'Reading without reflecting is like eating without digesting'. Edmund Burke said it best! Working at a Title I school comes with several challenges. Over half of my third-graders are on free or reduced lunch. Two-thirds come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. It's no surprise that so many of them struggle with comprehension. By the time students enter my classroom, most of them have learned to read fluently, but have little comprehension. Reading without meaning is a recurring problem year after year. With this project, I hope to be able to set up small learning centers that will allow my students to practice comprehension skills in a variety of ways. I hope to show them how to take small chunks of high-interest text and carefully examine each piece. My students will learn how to utilize graphic organizers to find the evidence that supports their answers. With the activities funded through this project, I hope to bring meaning to my students' reading. I want to show them that there is a purpose with all reading we do, whether it be learning new information or for pure entertainment. I hope to create life long readers!

Kennedy. A powerful statement that empowers me to provide my students with fun and interactive ways to keep their minds bursting with knowledge. My students have bright smiles that light up the classroom despite their disabilities that range from moderate to severe diagnosis. Each day they are exposed to functional learning experiences that engage their minds and help them to understand the world they are living in. Our school community welcomes students with disabilities and promotes an inclusive setting. It is in these exclusive settings that my students are able to work with their same age peers and develop friendships. Physical Education is an important part of my students' fine and gross motor skills development. My students need more instructional time to master movement concepts and instruction needs to be engaging, creative, and fun! The target toss and comet balls are one of the ways my students can work on their motor skills. The activity mats, toss and catch play set, and balancing spoon game are also ways to promote skills development while also teaching them cooperative play. These hands-on active play resources will help my students gain the practice they need not only through the school year, but also while attending summer school. Additionally, my students will also be learning new vocabulary, practicing math skills, and learning some science concepts. By having these additional opportunities to learn these academic skills, my students will begin to generalize the concepts and learn that language, math, and science can be done outside while having fun in the sun! As a first year Special Education teacher, my goal is to provide my students with the necessary skills to learn at their individual levels, while introducing functional concepts. The best way to accomplish this is to provide a variety of learning opportunities in multiple learning modalities. That is why this project is important to me. Your donation will help me expand our functional curriculum to the outdoors and that will not only benefit my students this year, but in years to come. Thank-you.

Bringing them to a Civil War reenactment would help them to learn about and understand the Civil War. My classroom consists of students with significant learning handicaps. Although they are in high school, they learn at an elementary school level. Visual aids and hands-on experiences seem to be the most effective means of achieving understanding and interest. My students are learning all subjects, including social skills and functional skills. My students need to attend a Civil War reenactment experience to bring history to life. This would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the majority of my students. I have attended the Civil War reenactment, and I am positive that this field trip would be one that they will not soon forget. Not only will they get to see the Blue and the Gray at battle, they will also get to go through an encampment and see how Civil War soldiers lived during that time. By donating and enabling my students to attend the Civil War reenactment, you will be providing an amazing learning experience that no textbook or film could ever come close to achieving.

81ac5109013957fb62180ed32f873c82,Real Photography for Special Needs Students,"Photography class at this school is designed to be a studio class where students get the opportunity to try different types of film and digital cameras both in studio as well as outdoors. Students at my school are very motivated, hard working kids. Their defining characteristic is their willingness to do what is on the menu for the day. They are willing to work through adversity to reach their goals. They have great can do attitudes. Academic success is their primary focus each day. And they are just darn nice kids. The primary concern is my physically challenged students. Each year 2 to 4 students with physical limitations takes photography. Often these students are incapable of holding a camera still or even focus. With this camera we can interface it with an IPad that allows the student to focus the camera, compose the image, adjust ISO, Aperture and shutter speed. It also allows them to fire the camera. The iPad gives them immediate feed back on how the image looks. Currently, the DSLR's we have are not advanced enough to run the adaptive device (a Cam-Ranger). This device will make a difference in my classroom in two ways. The first way is that it will make photography accessible to the physically challenged students I get each year. It will allow them to take pictures with a high degree of individual choice. The second way is as a demonstration tool for classroom purposes. This camera will allow for displaying, in real time,the steps taken to create an image.

We have a program in which we target reading skills and build fluency and comprehension. The goal is to exit students within two years and to bring a flavor and culture to reading they will find intriguing, appreciate and understand. My students are middle schoolers with 6-8th grade mixed in my classes. I have a mix of general education students, students learning English, and students with special needs. My classes are capped at 24 students with a total of 72 students. I currently have a waiting list of students to get into my class. Our population is a diverse population; our school has a large population of African Americans, Mexican American students, and several other students learning English. Our school is 85% free and reduced lunch. We have a beautiful campus with diverse students eager for the chance to learn and make something of themselves. Students will be able to read these books at an independent level. These books are highly engaging for middle school students since the main characters are teenage students. I have seen how these books help students with self esteem struggles; they see the characters having difficulties in the middle school setting and realize they are not alone. My students realizing they are not alone in navigating the scary world of middle school allows them to take chances in which they never would have in the past. And one of those chances is to learn to be a better reader. By having interesting and applicable reading material my students will be able to work on reading skills to build vocabulary, background knowledge, fluency, and comprehension. Books that have become movies are of huge interest to my students. They will be able to read the books and compare and contrast the differences between the movies and the books.

34a3c29b6457e537b7d9e3f402277a14,Literature Lovers!,"Every day students are reading, reviewing language skills, and talking about current events together. They make connections between Literature and Nonfiction, and what is happening today, in the real world. We debate, discuss, and infer together, and everyone is encouraged to 'show what they know'! Our school is unique because we are a public school but gifted, regular, and disabled students all attend classes together and there are lots of opportunities for cross grade interactions. It is normal to see students of all ability levels playing basketball with two students in wheelchairs, or a 4th grader teaching a 1st grader to sound out words, or how to design a catapult! Some 4th grade students visit 5th grade once a week because we do what is best for kids. We are an IMPACT Academy, that stresses Problem Solving and Positive attitudes, and as the front of our school announces, 'All students are welcome at Garden Grove!'. This year we will have 35 students in each of two fourth grade classrooms. We want to extend our Literature Circle book sets to include a Science Fiction genre (When you Reach Me), a realistic fiction (Because of Winn Dixie) and a Historical Fiction (By the Great Horn Spoon). Since we only receive about $100/year for books & supplies, these extra book sets, and art supplies of paint, pencils, paper and pastels are critical for our extension projects to provide readers additional ways to revisit what they've read, and continue the conversations and discoveries to create even more meaning. Game Boards, CD Covers, Character bookmarks, collages, ABC books, commemorative stamps, accordion books, paper story quilts and salt dough maps are some of the planned projects. Extra kids mean extra books and supplies needed! No one should be left without a book or art supplies! As more and more students are packed into our classrooms, we sometimes forget the power of one book-one student. While it is true students could share novels, there is something magical about curling up on the rug with your own book, reading at your own pace, and getting lost in that literary world for a while each day. These few extra sets of books mean one book/child . The art supplies mean there are enough supplies even for students who come from homes who cannot afford extras.

c3668d717eb8d6c374789ac08056012c,Unbroken in Middle School,"I'm tired of my traditional 8th grade students telling me they hate English class on the first day of school. They've never truly found a book they are inspired by, or a book that offers a strong role model that makes them want to know more about themselves and the world around them. I want change! My traditional English students are in 8th grade and have tried to find many creative ways around not doing real work so that they can 'slide by' and not be noticed. They 'fake read' because they don't know who they are as readers and they no longer care about stories or the heroes that lay within the pages of a novel. I have a large percentage of energetic students curious about history. I have students with low reading scores who would never consider 'reading' on their top 100 hobbies of 'after school activities'. My school's largest demographic category is low social economic status. I believe every child can learn, but that they need the right tools. I believe that the adapted young adult book 'Unbroken' can be the very book that changes their reluctance into sizzling energy. Olympian Louis Zamperini spends a difficult 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. 'Unbroken' is the story about resilience of the human mind, body and spirit, and can give inspiration to students and teach them the value of perseverance. Students will engage in literature circles and will discuss the major events in small group settings. Students will not only write objective academic summaries, but will, but will cite evidence that proves Zamperini is a hero. Students will also draw inferences about the main character to support their opinion and establish a formal writing style by doing so. Overall, the book will inspire struggling readers to read more, and to write more compelling essays that challenge them to cite evidence and to use logical reasoning in their essays. If I can get one student to love this book, I may have perhaps caused them to become life long readers. If I can do that, I have created a critical thinker. I've helped create one more soul dedicated to becoming a stronger citizen all by having read a book about a tough American hero who refused to give up. I can get my class talking about historical issues, and real people who turned crisis into an opportunity to prevail. I believe 'Unbroken' is that one book.

Creating a multi-genre classroom library with popular books is what I'm hoping will be the key to unlocking a life-long love of reading for my students. I have the best students in the whole world! OK, well I am admittedly biased. While they are not the highest socio-economic level, they are hard working and goal oriented. Most of my middle school students want to go to college and work toward that goal. Many of the parents have a college background, and those that don't work hard to keep their families comfortable. Unfortunately, we don't have a great local library and parents don't always have the opportunity to take their kids to the library to get the books that they want. Our school places literacy development very high in our academics and we want our students to improve their reading levels each year. We have a designated 30 minute period 4 times a week where students are expected to read to work toward this goal. Our district has had a multitude of budgetary woes in recent years and one area that has been hit hard is in our libraries. We just don't have the number of current books available to meet the students wants. I can't wait to stand at my bookshelf with a student and have a conversation with them about books! Often times a student will not know what to read and I have to fly somewhat blindly when suggesting books that they may enjoy. With a well stocked library we can actually look at, pick up, and peruse through potential books to read. Students participate in book talks weekly, which helps others to add to their queue of next books to read. If I have many of these books available to the students it would help to increase the number of books that they read. Furthermore, we are going to be having Literacy Circle units this year where students will read multiple books from a specific genre. This allows student to have thoughtful talks and discussions on specific genre traits, theme and plot development, as well as how characters and setting work to move the plot and theme along. Kids need to have books available to them if we are going to ask them to read. The flip chart easel and Post-It notes will also help. Not all kids are readers. Often kids 'hate' reading because they haven't found the right book(s) for them. If students have a variety of genres, subject, and lengths of books I am confident that this can help to tear down the 'I hate reading' wall. I've seen students blossom when they have a chance to talk to their peers about books. With a well stocked classroom library I know that students will read more, increase their literacy and ultimately foster a stronger knowledge base.

The children will select books at their level of reading to assure success. The toy kitchen and props help create opportunities for creativity and social skill development. I envision the children writing recipes and taking an order for food to prepare. These materials will provided a stimulating environment to facilitate learning in my kindergarten students. Once the environment feels like home and safe, the children will flourish and grew as I prepare then academically in all areas.

For the first week of school, they came to school every day filled with excitement about being in school. The students were excited to be able to check out books from our classroom library. These students have been impacted by the Great Flood of 2016. The school that was their second home has been flooded and is now being gutted and rebuilt. I'd like to give them some sense of normalcy. After being submerged during the Great Flood of 2016, my classroom library is gone. This library has been built by myself over the past 15 years that I have been teaching. The students are starting school on Monday at a different campus but do not have any books to read. Reading is a great way to relax the body and mind during this difficult time. This is especially important to my students because they need to be able to 'escape the realities of life' for awhile. What better way to escape than through a novel. Students will be able to check out these books just like they would a library. Then they'll be able to test their comprehension through Accelerated Reader assessments for the books. Along with transporting my students to another time/place through these books, they will also be building their comprehension skills. It is important to me that these students continue to grow educationally through this difficult time in their lives.","My students need to be able to have different types of books to checkout and read.

da67acee1eab5b131613383e2963fc95,Living the Past: Historical Fiction Genre Study,"'Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.' -Helen Keller. Therein lies the power of the classroom, and any teacher worth their salt knows that forming a community--particularly a reading community--is the foundation to a great year. My students are bright and willing, but need assistance in terms of literacy resources and experiences, which is why I am constantly on the lookout for great books to read together. Most of my students come from families with two working parents. As a working mom with two children of my own, I often lament my family's loss of reading time to the demands of just making it through the day. Reading, in my opinion, is mistakenly considered a solitary activity. You may take the words in through your own eyes, but I believe so much is lost if you don't share everything that happens after that--the joy, surprise, confusion, frustration and reward of reading good books. I want to create these opportunities in school, for this is what creates lifelong readers. If my project is funded, my students will participate in a genre study of historical fiction. Students will be able to chose an historical novel that interests them and read in small groups of 3-4, while together we will use our selections to examine the genre and its traits. It is important that students are exposed to and immersed in many kinds of print and many types of literature. A genre study is one way to accomplish that. I chose the genre of historical fiction as one way to support history standards. Our past is too vast and complicated to be covered in one history class per year; reading historical fiction not only brings the past to life, but it also exposes children to parts of history that may not be covered adequately in their course of social studies. Additionally, my students will read primary sources and informational texts associated with the time-preiod of their chosen novel, which adds another element of genre exposure (fiction v. non-fiction). Ultimately, a genre study will allow us to not only enjoy historical content, but also to 'compare and contrast a fictional portrayal of a time, place, or character and a historical account of the same period as a means of understanding how authors of fiction use or alter history.'

Having a music education for these kids is such a privilege to them, and they absolutely LOVE learning about music and how to play their instruments. We have a high minority and high poverty level here, but that doesn't stop my students from wanting to learn music! If children are not introduced to music at a young age, I believe something fundamental is being taken from them. I have 185 students in the band program here, and my classes are divided by grade and sometimes by instrument. I teach students from 6 through 8th grade! I seriously consider my job my biggest blessing because I am able to come to school daily and work with these kids. They truly make my heart happy, and I cannot express enough great things about the students I get to teach on a daily basis. The Community of SA was hit by a terrible flood beginning on Friday, August 12, 2016. MANY of my students lost their homes, quite a few lost the instruments, and the band room at SA middle school flooded. Most things in my band room have been thrown away. The music stands that I am requesting are used daily in class by 185 students. They use them to place their music, folder, and pencil on while we play. If not for the band, what music would the dance team and cheerleading squad dance to throughout the game? My 7th and 8th grade football band will use the music from the Sports Pak daily in class as we prepare for football games/pep rallies. All of my band students will daily use the Foundations for Superior performance book to learn warm ups, scales, chorales, etc. from. Music makes my students HAPPY!

However, in terms of classroom supplies, they are used to sharing old, obsolete and sometimes barely functioning equipment. Three biology teachers currently share 6 electronic balances that may or may not function correctly on any given day. This means that lab procedures that should take 20 minutes can sometimes take 40 minutes as students line up to use electronic balances. Many of our students are on a free and reduced cost lunch program (46% of our population), and we have a high proportion of English language learners on our campus (32%). Despite this, our school has a vibrant campus culture with clubs and activities going on during lunch and recess most days. The rallies and athletic events are well-supported and well-attended. It is my belief that our students deserve the same equipment in their science classrooms that other schools in our district routinely receive from parent donations; however, our science programs are often hampered by limited funding. My project does not have the excitement of many others as I am simply asking for the funding to purchase 1 electronic balance. A single electronic balance does not sound like it will make much of a difference but when you have twelve lab groups and one student from each group responsible for collecting data thats 12 students in line. A single functioning electronic balance added to the room can halve that line to 6, if my other two balances are working the lines drop down to 4. Suddenly, the data can be collected in a timely manner during one class period. Suddenly we can move on to the analysis THAT day and not the next and the lesson has momentum and that makes a difference to learning.",My students need an electronic balance to allow them to collect accurate data in their labs in order to collect evidence to make claims,Math & Science,Grades 9-12,Supplies,472.19,Fully Funded

For many of my students, school is where they have access to books, supplies and other resources that support their academic achievement. I teach a special education class with 25 students that range from pre-kindergarten to 5th grade. Their disabilities range from learning disabilities to visually impaired. They come from a diverse background. Some students have limited verbal ability. Five students have limited motor skills, which limits their writing ability.
