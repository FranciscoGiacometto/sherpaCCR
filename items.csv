2274d68de7068287375b9d025ceba625,Collaboration Station in the RJE Learning Commons,"We are acquiring more and more technology at RJE, mobile technology, in particular. While this is exciting, we struggle to find spaces for students to use it. I feel that if we have a fun, kid friendly space that will facilitate an environment of collaboration and teamwork, kids will flock to it! RJE has 636 students, and they are very social. They love to play together and work together. In fact, teachers encourage students to work together to encourage cooperation and compromise. It also allows our students to learn from one another. They like the affiliation aspect of learning. My goal is to use our collaboration station area for working in groups, particularly with technology. We are fortunate to have many iPads on our campus that are intended for student use. With the collaboration station, students could use our tablets or other devices and collaboratively work on a project. They could even use this shared space to visit and communicate with students outside of our campus via Skype or Face Time. The furniture that I am requesting will facilitate a coworking environment and encourage children to work together and use our mobile technology in a collaborative, cooperative way. I would be thrilled to offer my students this modern learning space for their studies. I want to provide a book store or coffee house setting that will appeal to our 21st century learners as well as accommodate discussions and our mobile technology. I am requesting a 5 piece Wesco Modular Square Soft Seater that sits low to the ground and will accommodate up to 8 students and/or staff. Each piece is a bright color and there is a center piece for materials and such. Currently, we have rectangular tables, which are well suited for classes and meetings, but they are not ideal for a small group, who may want to meet privately and/or have small group discussions. With the furniture that I am requesting, the seating will be perfect for small groups that are working on a project together, and a perfect place for students to use mobile technology together. If RJE receives this seating option, I will complete the collaboration station by adding a stationary iPad. I want to provide our students with furniture that will be fun and colorful. Schools must align their classroom environments with real world environments in order to prepare our students for the future. To do that, schools must practice the 4 Cs: critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity. My students need a go to space to work together that will allow them to talk, ask questions, and practice their critical thinking skills. I want to provide a setting that will appeal to our 21st century learners and accommodate collaboration at its finest!

Or perhaps, wanted to show something enhanced right away? As a teacher, this is our life- to share! Both my eighth graders and myself are eager to share everything we learn and know with our class. A document camera will enable us to do so. I teach in a Title One, diverse, multi-cultural school. With over 29 languages represented on our campus, we need all the tools we can use to communicate with our students. My eighth graders love math and technology, and luckily math is a universal language. Our school is in a low socioeconomic neighborhood but full of eager, creative learners. In our district, our goal is to have all children excelling and to be college and career ready. We follow the common core standards to ensure that all students are getting the same quality education. My students get so excited when we are able to experience new learning through our smart boards, graphing calculators, laptop carts, and responders; however, we have needs that a document camera would fulfill. With the document camera, my students will have greater opportunities to share their work and discoveries, and learn in a more dynamic way! This will lead to greater listening and work skills. With this, they can share in a positive, encouraging manner. They will be able to use and display math manipulatives under the camera to explain thinking, as well as share their work and steps. Our school is big on STEM teaching in our classrooms, which allows more investigative exploration of topics. As a teacher, I would be able to model more efficiently to the class as a whole. This will also save A LOT of time, for documents not available for the smart board to view, will be able to be shown and not needed to be copied onto a whiteboard. Picture your child in a classroom with a document camera, would you not feel more confident in the learning taking place verses not having a document camera? They truly do help speed up the learning process, while making the learning more engaging and fun! Technology is the future! This will give our students another opportunity to be challenged and to express their ideas and thinking in a different, functional way. It is a more efficient way for me to model, to demonstrate, to display my graphing calculator to teach steps, and to show each other'ÂÂs work, which will enhance learning and knowledge of the world around us. Teaching is my passion and with the use of a document camera, I will be an even more effective educator for our future!Other's ","My students need a document camera in order to engage their learning, save time, and view virtually anything within moments.","Applied Learning, Math & Science",Grades 6-8,Technology,539.47,Fully Funded
8fcdf8aa06abe9f37ba0fde1a9df9d5c,Doc Camera,"Do you remember when a teacher was trying to show you something on a piece of paper and you could not see it? My students struggle with our language, and when they can't see what trick or change I made on a worksheet, it is hard for them, or when someone solved a problem and it can't be seen. My students are from all over the world. Some are just learning the English Language and this is their first classroom in America. Other students have been here or were born here. Our school is striving to achieve excellence in a low socioeconomic part of our state. We encourage and create lifelong learners and instill go ethics into our students. This way they do go on to further their education. Our school itself is on a 98% free and reduced lunch program to help the struggling parents. We don't have the funding for document cameras and other things that will help our children be prepared for the world. The teachers usually provide most of the school supplies and other basic needs for the children. Having a document camera will help my students inspire and learn from one another. It will help them see clearly where we are on a worksheet no matter where they sit in the room. An example of an activity is when we use factors in a Venn diagram to find the greatest common factor. Students can come up and place their document under the camera and explain how and why they got the answer they did. If they are incorrect it allows the other students to encourage a different answer. The students can now see each other's evidence and reasoning. This request is very important to me because even though my students are from a low socioeconomic area I want them to have the tools and skills any other child would. This way they can thrive in the environment and not continue to repeat a cycle of poverty. My students will have a chance to learn from each other and have clarity when doing a worksheet.

Being a visual learner myself, I understand the need for my class to have that same experience. Children need to SEE what they are learning to develop and challenge their minds. My classroom is currently full of 34 second grade students who are all eager to learn and come from very diverse and difficult backgrounds. I teach in a high poverty neighborhood in Arizona, where most of the population in our school are English Language Learners. Our kids have a strong desire to learn and challenge themselves, despite the hard challenges they face at home. They are extremely hard workers and push themselves to 'Achieve the American Dream'. As a child and an adult, I have always been a very visual learner. I need to see it to understand it, and experience it to remember it. My second grade students are the exact same way and I would love to give them ALL the opportunity to fall in love with learning through the use of a document camera. Since I have a large class this year, 34 students, it is difficult to model and teach in the way they need it without them seeing it first hand. By using a document camera, I can not only bring more technology into the classroom, but I can enhance their learning experience. Showing them other students work using the camera, or modeling lessons and independent practice that they can all visually see will be so much more rewarding to them as a learner. I also would love for my students to be able to teach their classmates using this technology tool. I can only see positive learning and success coming from the use of a document camera in my classroom! I honestly believe that a document camera could make a huge difference in my students' behavior and learning.

We work hard every day to help improve our reading skills while having fun. It's my goal that I will be able to help my students develop a love for reading just like my teachers did for me. I teach first grade at a school with a very diverse population. We have students from all different backgrounds with very different home lives. My school is located in an area where most of the families do not have much money, and often barely have enough money to cover their basic needs. My school is a choice school in our district so parents from any part of the district can choose to send their students to our school. The families here want only the best for their child and work hard to help their children to succeed in school even if they have limited time, money or even English speaking skills at home. The listening center will be allow small groups of students to listen to a story and follow along with the reader in their book. After the story they will be able listen to questions and check their comprehension of the stories even if they are still working on becoming independent readers. Having this listening center will allow one more center in my classroom so I can have smaller groups to work with and give students more personalized help during their time working with me each day. The whisper phones will be used when students are practicing letter sounds and decodable reader books. It can become very noisy with students reading to themselves, but these whisper phones will allow them to whisper their words and still hear themselves saying it without distracting others in their group or the entire class.

The iPad compliments all learning styles and can be used across all content areas. Our Elementary has four kindergarten sections of approximately 22 students a total of 76 kindergarteners. They are full of energy, enthusiasm, and a desire to learn! The goal of the grant is to use the iPads to improve student achievement across all populations. The touch screen facilitates easy use for tiny fingers still developing fine motor skills. The highly visual and animated delivery of iPad educational apps captures their imagination, motivates their desire to learn, and provides the authentic use of technology to master essential knowledge and skills. We are requesting three iPads. One of our teachers previously received an iPad through a grant. If this Donors Choose project is funded, the iPads will be placed permanently in each classroom. The use of the iPads will offer a plethora of appealing, hands-on learning experiences that will facilitate the mastery of kindergarten skills. The iPads will be utilized by independent student use in literacy and math stations. Students could use Tellagami, Videolicious, or Puppet Pals app to retell or create their own fairy tale. Another possibility would be to use Educreations app to describe the plant cycle or their animal research. Haiku Deck could be used to show their learning about landforms or science tools. The possibilities are endless! We want to provide a technology tool that will appeal to our 21st century learners, enhance instruction, and increase student learning.

Specifically, in fifth grade we study topics throughout US History, such as the Civil War, Civil Rights, immigration, and civics. We don't have a specific block of time in our schedule for social studies, so we will use these picture books not only to become better readers and writers, but to integrate many important social studies concepts into the curriculum. I believe that representing my diverse students' backgrounds in the curriculum is incredibly important. I want to read them books with characters who look like them and come from different countries like them, so that they can learn about the complex roots of American culture.

My students need more hands-on experiences, particularly with measurement in math and science. My students are curious and engaged learners who love learning with hands-on activities and games. Our school is in a high-poverty area and students often come with deficits in background knowledge, literacy, and real-world experiences. Our students love to come to school every day and take pride in their school and their learning. The most memorable and valuable lessons for them are ones that use real-world activities to connect to their real-life experiences. For example, having measuring cups will help students understand the concept of whole, half, and quarter when we follow recipes in math as a way to cement the concept of fractions. My students struggle to connect math and science to their daily lives--and across the curriculum. I had a student this year ask me why we were doing math during our science block! Measurement is an easy way to make those connections, yet students come to me with a poor understanding of concepts such as fractions, length, weight, and volume. Materials like a balance, scale, measuring cups, and thermometers will help us in our daily math classes and in our physical science units. We learn about weather and heat transfer, so the thermometers will aid in experiments measuring temperature. The scale will give students opportunities to measure the mass of substances before and after an interaction, and better understand the Law of Conservation of Matter. I will use the balance to help students understand the concept of balancing an algebraic equation so they can actually see and feel when you change the quantity on one side, you must adjust the other side to keep the equation balanced. For better or worse, standardized tests are a big part of public education. I know that having these measurement materials will help students dig deeper into math and science content, giving them a more firm understanding and helping them be more successful on tour End-of-Grade tests.

c2f9f00d42cf94a8e54a70c438830ae5,A 3D Printer for Academically Talented!,"Energetic. Hands-on. Inquisitive. These are just a few words that describe the Academically Talented students I get to work with each day. These students are excited about learning and would love to have the opportunity to take their learning to the next level with a 3D printer. The seed of a 3D printer and a makerspace was planted by last year's Academically Talented teacher. Now, the 8th grade class, in their last year at the middle school, would like to make a 3D printer a reality in the 5th through 8th grade Academically Talented program. Eager to learn, discover, and create, the students are also excited to be able to design, code, print, and ultimately hold their own ideas in their hands. Before even receiving a 3D printer and just by creating this project, the students are learning about planning and marketing. The students began with researching 3D printers in order to determine the best printer to meet their needs. As they develop this project together, they are also working as a team to market and spread the word about this campaign so that it is successful. Once the students have received this 3D printer and filament, so many more opportunities will be open to them. From learning to code and design their own projects and inventions, to the problem-solving, and persistence required to refine their projects, the students will be able to develop the hands-on learning experiences needed to increase their STEM awareness and 21st Century Skills that are so necessary to their future. Our goal is to make our ideas and projects come to life with a 3D printer. The addition of a 3D printer to the Academically Talented program will allow us to actually apply our learning in real ways, rather than just through discussion or writing. This 3D printer is not only for us, but for all of the current and future students in the program. We are leading this project not only for ourselves, but for the younger AT students as well. We are not only researching and typing up this campaign, but we are planning a media campaign within our school and community to create awareness for our project. This project is important to our school and community because it will provide us and the younger Academically Talented students with a multitude of opportunities that were not available before. We will be able to learn about coding and project design as we become the engineers. And while we, the 8th grade class, will be gone in a year, what we have done for the AT program will not.

The are now eager to take these projects to the next level - from simple 3D objects to programmable, functioning robots using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. From the day they started working with the 3D printer, my students have been brainstorming what they can print and make. Printing simple objects has been interesting, but they are eager to tackle more advanced projects and challenges. They have seen fully, functioning robots using 3D printed parts programmed with controllers like Raspberry Pi 2 and the Arduino Uno R3, and decided this was the next step they wanted to take. Through the combination of our existing 3D printer and the programming capabilities of the Arduino Starter Kits, my students will be able to learn and apply their knowledge of coding to real-world situations. They will be able to work cooperatively as a team, designing and printing the parts needed to construct their robots, and then program their robot to complete a task. According to Eric, 'Our project is to expand our engineering skills and our knowledge of electronics customization by obtaining two Arduino Starter Kits and two Raspberry Pi 2 Starter Kits. Combining our 3D printer with these kits, we can create a balanced, electronics driven curriculum that inspires ingenuity and opens minds to the vast world of robotics, programming, and the creation of objects that can change the world.' This project is important not only our class, but also to the classes and students below us. We understand that we will be leaving this school at the end of this year, but we also understand that this project will not only benefit our learning during our last year, but will benefit the younger students in the Academically Talented program. This project will solve the main obstacle we currently face with our 3D printer curriculum. We are able to print nice objects for projects, but we are not able to use those objects and parts to program working electronics and robots. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi will allow us that next step in our engineering learning.

They want to learn in a manner that suits their own personalities. My students are 21st century learners, meaning they love technology and overall are kinesthetic learners. I think giving them choice and opportunity to do work wherever they want in the room is motivating and beneficial to their learning experience. Since every child is different, I believe in having different choices and opportunities for them. They love having a voice and choice in their seating arrangement and activities during the day. My dream is to set up my classroom like a coffee shop. When you go into a coffee shop to do some work, you have choice. I don't have someone telling me my spot for the remainder of my time there. I have the choice to pick my seat. I also have the choice to change my mind and sit somewhere else during my time at the coffee shop. My students love the opportunity to have a voice in the classroom. Having different seating options will really help them in determining where they want to complete their work. Setting my classroom up as a coffee shop will really emphasize the type of learning environment my students want and need. I want to lower one desk and have the deluxe sit-upons as an option for students who want to work at a desk but in a different way. Wobble chairs around a table would be the perfect asset to my classroom for those students who like to move while they work. Other things I plan on doing is having one table with chairs and one table that will be raised up to be a stand and learn desk. I will provide stools under the raised desk to provide a seating option if need be. Yoga mats and clipboards will also be utilized in my room for those students that work best lying down.

The photo shows my entire special education team of teachers, paraprofessionals, diagnosticians, and speech and occupational therapists that work together to meet each child's needs. The students we serve have different disabilities, such as Learning Disabilities, Autism, Intellectual Disabilities, and Emotional Disturbances. They often struggle with the day to day challenges that face them in the classroom, and can become overwhelmed very easily. They want to come to school to learn and make friends, but due to their challenges, they often have a hard time doing so.I would like to create a special sensory rich classroom for the students in my school to be able to access throughout the day before they reach sensory overload. This classroom will be a place that they can spend time and feel safe. The sensory tools included in this special room will be used by numerous children on a daily basis to help them be able to relax and get their emotions and feelings back in check to be able to function in their classrooms. These tools could be the life line for many students to help them better perform in a typical classroom. When special needs students begin to feel overwhelmed, they often begin to show behaviors that disrupt the classroom. The rocker, weighted tools, tilt board, and headphones will allow my students enough sensory input to realign their bodies with their minds so that they can function. These tools can be used in the sensory classroom, or checked out by individual teachers to help these students transition into general education classrooms so they can be included like all children.
