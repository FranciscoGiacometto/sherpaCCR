f4842d9369baaf8f5ae34119f09e1b4c,Desperately Need Students to Conduct International Research,"Kids and Culture is a new club we have formed in the past few years. We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past four years, our small initiative has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. This calendar year, a small group of students will be traveling through Spain and Portugal. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the religious influences on art and literature, strengthen their Spanish speaking skills by volunteering with a community center, and compare the traditions, cultures, and cuisine to what they are accustomed to. They will be part of nightly conversations that ask them to reflect on the experience in the moment. Much of their experience will be captured in nightly journals that will be collected. These will assist with their research upon returning. In funding this grant, you give another student the opportunity to travel with us. The total cost covers everything for the student, including transportation, meals, and all activity costs. The research, experience, and life long lessons that are produced from these tours are true testaments to the value of this program. Past students have continued to succeed (100% of alumni are enrolled in four year institutions) and many students have continued their studies with semesters abroad.

8c8f0bc9fe659b59bc82bcc032894f3c,Freedom of Speech- Public School Students &The First Amendment,"'Tomorrow is Now. It is today that we must create the world of the future.'~Eleanor Roosevelt 'Nothing But the Truth' integrates Civics into the English classroom. My lessons begin by having students explore cases where claims were made that students' first amendment rights were violated. My students are motivated kids who want to learn. This year is a giant transition for them as their middle school was shut down due to budget cuts and they were moved to the local high school where I teach. For the most part, they are the group that represents the above average sector of their grade level, and I believe that researching first amendment court cases and then reading 'Nothing But the Truth' will produce critical thinking and writing from this group. The school they attend is in a lower socioeconomic area where there is little parental involvement. The majority of our school population receives free or reduced lunch. Our district offers free breakfast and most of our students take advantage of this as the free breakfast and free lunch might be all they eat that day. Additionally the students come to me with very little prior or background knowledge of the world outside their community which makes discussion of literature difficult. I will be able to integrate civics into the English classroom by doing a pre-reading activity with the first amendment. Students will understand the first amendment of the constitution as it applies to public school students. They will learn concepts such as advocacy of illegal action, commercial speech, and forum. They will research cases where students' first amendment rights were violated such as Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) where students were suspended for wearing black armbands as a silent protest to the Vietnam War. They will identify the facts of each case, each sides' position, the decision held by the court, and its effect on the country. Students will be grouped by case and will create a digital presentation to share with the class. As a class, we will then read 'Nothing But the Truth' where a student is suspended for humming/singing along to the Star-Spangled Banner instead of standing at silent, respectful attention. We will conclude with a persuasive writing opportunity. Students will have the opportunity to read from books that are new and not falling apart from being used for year after year after year. They won't have to stare at a sticker saying the book belongs to another school that's in a more affluent area because I had to beg and promise favors just to borrow a class set for a limited time. They will know that this class set belongs to OUR classes and they will feel ownership and pride. Most importantly, they will glean real world knowledge.

Today's students live in a global society, and all students deserve the opportunity to explore and experience the world through cultures with which they are unfamiliar. Despite the fact the my students come from an urban environment facing economic and social issues that can bring them an enormous amount of stress, they continue to show that they are dedicated to success at amazing levels. My students are committed to their education in both an academic and personal sense. They seek out opportunities, such as the chance to study the culture of Morocco, in order to learn more about the world they live in and their place in it. These high school students hope to strengthen their understanding of the world as they begin to explore their collegiate opportunities, and plan for their futures. The opportunity for students to experience learning on the international stage has long been relegated to those who are financially able to attain these goals. However, my colleagues and I believe that these experiences should be available to all students. In the months leading up to their trip, my students begin conducting research in various areas of the culture of Morocco. For many students, this is the first time they are able to completely self-direct their learning, focusing on various aspects of culture- from fashion trends and choices, to studying the education system in the country they visit. Students will conclude their research by visiting the country they are studying, gaining the chance to live like a local and to see the world from a new perspective. Students gain the opportunity to grow as individuals and as learners as they gain college credit for their research endeavors. In addition, students have the opportunity to give back. They will be volunteering their time in local communities, participating in activities as diverse as visiting local schools and working with local farmers to better understand the way of life in the country. In funding this grant, you will help to fund the trips of 5 students who are in great economic need. These students will be able to compare their experience in a western nation to the experience of teenagers living in a world vastly different from their own. You will help to instill a love of learning that will carry these students through their academic careers at the university level, as well as in their professional endeavors.

To many, our classrooms are a safe haven from the challenges of their home lives. Through their perseverance, they strive for success in reaching their educational and good citizenship goals. I am blessed to work with such an awesome group of students each year!My students need a classroom carpet where we can gather comfortably, engage in meaningful discussions and share our writing pieces with one another. Our classroom does not have a common meeting place where we can interact with each other comfortably as a group. In the elementary grades, it is especially important to develop the skills of being an active listener and presenter of one's own work and ideas. Having such a place in our classroom where my students can present their thoughts and ideas to each other and actively comment, will help build their confidence as they progress on their educational journey. Engaging in meaningful conversations with one another will also help to foster a sense of community and respect within our classroom environment.","My students need a classroom carpet where we can gather comfortably, engage in meaningful discussions and share our writing pieces with one another.","Health & Sports, Literacy & Language",Grades PreK-2,Supplies,512.29,Fully Funded

Since it is a special education class they really benefit from hands-on class work and work in an environment that allows them to get up and move around the room whenever needed. My students are always asking for more. More games, more play, more hopping, skipping and running. The activity mat for small group centers and the sports balls will fulfill their need and want to play more with each other. They constantly ask for more play time. Especially after a long day of reading/writing/math. By having the games/activities in the classroom my students will have access to them during indoor recess and during center time in the classroom. They will be able to play with the materials and enjoy socializing with their friends in the classroom. They need to move and socialize with each other outside of the common core curriculum.
