'Students learn appropriate behaviors in the same way they learn to read...through instruction, practice, feedback and encouragement.'I have requested books that will be a great tool in teaching kids life lessons. These books will be used in classroom guidance lessons, small groups, and individual counseling.I am a k-5 elementary school counselor split between 2 different Title 1 elementary schools. Students attend a neighborhood elementary school with a high rate of students qualifying for free and reduced lunches. Many of my students come from very challenging backgrounds. The books I am requesting are all centered around teaching and building social and life skills. I think it is an important part of a student's educational experience for us to introduce, model, and reinforce positive social behavior. My responsibility is to make sure that the students have the tools they need to be successful in school and give them skills they need to become good citizens. My students need books that will capture their attention and provide opportunities for learning character education and social/life skills. The counseling resources that I have requested promote life skills such as respect, responsibility, empathy,good manners, honesty, anger management and teamwork. Life-skills are an important component of a well-rounded education. The books that I have requested will provide them with the necessary tools that support their personal, social, emotional, physical, and academic needs. Thank you in advance for helping provide resources for my guidance program. My students would not have access to these materials it it wasn't for your support.

I want my kindergarten students to have the same experience, a favorite book that they can recall when they are grown! I teach in a magnet school and I have 23 enthusiastic, fun-loving kindergarteners. My kindergarteners come from a wide range of family dynamics, some live in traditional households while others live in single parent households, and others live with extended family. My students' economic situations are just as varied as their family dynamics and sixty percent of my class qualifies for free lunch. Regardless of these factors, every one of my students possesses a passion for learning, exploring, and playing! I am requesting a set of Elephant and Piggie books by Mo Willems and information texts about weather. Mo Willems writes books that are loved by kindergarteners and my class is no exception! Each week when my students go to media many of them return with one of his Elephant and Piggie books. I would like to have a set of these popular books in our classroom so that my class can enjoy them on a regular basis. I am also requesting some weather themed informational texts. After reading a Weekly Reader, my students became fascinated with all different types of weather, but especially tornadoes! The weather and tornado books will enable my students to continue to learn about a subject they enjoy. By donating to this project you will give my students books that they will enjoy and that are kindergarten appropriate. The informational texts will be used as a part of our upcoming nonfiction unit in Readers and Writers Workshop and with some exciting science projects! Thank you.

They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. We have a rapidly expanding band program. If the rate of growth keeps up, I will not be able to get instruments to all the students who want to join band next year. I have been acquiring instruments in every way I can, but even with the used instruments I've been able to acquire, I haven't been able to keep up with the need for instruments among students who couldn't otherwise afford to rent or buy one from a music store. This instrument will not only give many students an enriching opportunity to learn to play the clarinet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing this clarinet could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music. This project will bring a quality clarinet into my classroom and into the hands of a student who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford this experience.

Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

Putting in notes using midi keyboards would be much easier than using laptop track pads. My students are middle school students attending a magnet school for the gifted in Illinois. These students are taught using inquiry based teaching and are highly motivated to learn new things. Most have attended the same school for gifted students since first grade. In our music classes, we introduce composing using computers. Despite some having limited experience with music instruction, students don't balk at trying this new concept, and embrace it with enthusiasm. My students need 12 midi keyboards for our composing classes. My students have been entering notes in the Finale program, by clicking on each individual staff line or space to place the notes. This is difficult enough with a mouse, but we are using laptops, making it even trickier. With the purchase of these midi keyboards, students will be able to plug them in and play the note they wish to place instead. This will not only speed up their composing process, but will help them to learn the location of notes on a piano keyboard as well. Introducing these children to creating music is an important part of their education. Creativity is highly valued in the work place and this project could potentially impact their future careers. Being a risk taker and stepping out of ones comfort zone is just the sort of life preparation we like to provide for these students.

Many of them are refugees from war-torn countries like Burundi, the Congo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Reading is challenging for many of them--especially for those who've missed several years of school for economic or safety reasons prior to moving to the U.S. I have been growing my classroom library with books from rummage sales and used bookstores, but I would love to be able to offer my students more books with characters they can identify with. My students deserve to have access to a wide range of fiction and nonfiction texts that allow them to explore and validate their own identities as immigrants and young people of color. These 22 texts were carefully chosen, and many of them have won awards or are on Teaching For Change's recommended reading lists. I know my students will devour them as soon as we get them into the classroom, and that they will be well-loved for years to come.

Even though most of my students face hardship, they come to school excited about learning, especially reading. With the resources I've requested, my students will be interacting in reading literacy centers. I've requested grade level book sets to have my students engage in book groups. This opportunity would allow them to discuss books as a group and learn together. I've also requested some picture books to read aloud to my students. We will use these texts to show how authors use writing in powerful ways, practice reading comprehension skills, and use before, during, and after reading strategies. With these powerful tools, my students' reading comprehension and enjoyment will increase. I hope to see a positive boost in reading success levels with the use of these resources. This project is immensely crucial to impact student learning. I believe in exposing children to great literature and to use authors as supplemental teachers in my classroom.

Many of my students do not have access to any type of technology within their homes, so it is up to the school to provide this opportunity. Our school is a Math Science Technology Magnet school, there are 34 students and two computers in my classroom. We are a title 1 school. So many of our students get breakfast and lunch for free. The two iPad minis in my classroom will engage and challenge my students with brand new and interactive methods. I will use the iPad minis to differentiate instruction through small groups. This way I will be able to individualize instruction for those students who are outside my small group and the group I will be working with.

Many families are Title One families. We have to rely on the support of grants or donations to get most of our technology. Unfortunately, when we have our mobile computer lab, many of the students are frustrated because we do not have enough headphones for the students to use. Many of the original headphones are now 5 years old and broken. There are no headphones to use. The students cannot hear the Successmaker program. All students benefit with reading and listening to the program. It helps with their fluency as well. Students who have a low reading level are at a particular disadvantage using our Successmaker program because they cannot read accurately and with fluency the problems on the computer screen without headphones. I believe all of my students need reliable headphones. If each child has their very own headphone to be responsible for, I believe that they will last several years. My Project: The most important computer program in our school for math and reading is our Successmaker computer program. Successmaker is unique in that it can find the student's ability level through questions and problems that the student answers. Then Successmaker individualizes the program to each student's abilities. With a headphone, each one of my students will be able to understand not only by sight, but by hearing the words and sounds all of the educational activities on Successmaker. This will definitely impact the ability of my students to learn their math and reading in 3rd grade.

When reading aloud to them I see the sparkle in their eyes, but I also see them more engaged if they also have a copy of the book I am reading. It is often difficult to keep their attention for long periods of time. This, however, is NOT the case when it comes Sharon Draper's book 'Sassy-Little Sister is not my name!' This was one of the most rewarding times I spent with my students with a chapter book. There were chapter questions for each chapter where students had to revisit the chapter to answer. There were opportunities for creativity when students wrote in the character's point of view. After we finished book 1, the students said, 'This was the best book ever! Are we reading book 2-4?' Our school is comprised of all of the third and fourth graders in our district. We are located in a low-income area with a high rate of students receiving free or reduced lunch. My students will use the classroom sets of the chapter book series of 'Sassy,' by author Sharon M. Draper, during our reading block. During this time we sit in a 'U' shape with our desks and engage ourselves in book discussions for every chapter. We will answer questions created that are Common Core driven. Creativity will be involved, as they create their 'Sassy' journals, and students will be able to each have a copy where they will be able to work in literature circles with their peers.

Unfortunately, last year our computer cart fell and broke, so we're using a 20-year-old cart that doesn't function properly. Having a new cart will allow us to more safely use the equipment to project classroom lessons, videos, etc. onto a large surface. All our students want is to be able to access the most up-to-date digital equipment for their learning pleasure. This cart will make a great difference in the ability to project information for all to see. Thank you so much.

This presents a challenge when asking students to acquire certain materials for class. Some will have have every luxury (ipads, laptops) when others can't even afford the most basic supplies (a binder). Students will have access to the calculators on a daily basis for use in calculations while conducting laboratory experiments, as well as in other coursework.

That is how it was for my first graders when I introduced them to the Elephant and Piggie series by Mo Willems. They so love Piggie and her friend Gerald that the characters feel like two more kids in our classroom! I teach at a public alternative school. The literacy workshop curriculum keeps the students active and engaged. Like every primary teacher, my class includes kids who are already reading, as well as kids who are just dipping their feet in the water. It is for this latter group, in particular, that I am requesting a Donors Choose grant. I hope to buy a large set of these magical books that kids won't put down! I hope you'll come on board with me! Beginning readers confidently read what each character is saying because they have learned their personalities and ways of interacting. Pictures of them and their talking balloons have started surfacing in the students' drawings and I have even heard familiar exchanges during the kids' spontaneous drama. I knew we were on to something good, but unfortunately, there are not enough books in the classroom or library to satisfy this thirst. I want to use the Elephant and Piggie books in Readers Theater activities with students to help them build confidence and voice as readers. A larger collection of them can increase their use as take home, read-aloud-to-family books, because they are books these kids are dying to read aloud. When the occasional book is left at home, the other kids will not feel so disappointed. Elephant and Piggie will also contribute to my students' growth as writers, as the kids are already drawing these beloved characters and captioning their conversations with speech bubbles modeled after those in the texts. More copies spread out on the tables will invite them to add words they have memorized, or copy words that express what they want to say. Sight words will serve the greatest purpose (rather than flashcard practice), rounded out with best guess spelling that builds phonics knowledge and fluency with writing. In short, Elephant and Piggie (and the Pigeon) inspire, and inspired readers are fearless readers. Because my children believe in and love the voices of these characters and their friends (yes, there is a snake, a bat, a bird...), they are building their own voices as readers in order to spend time with these characters, and then extending that inspiration in writing. Please help build our collection of these go-to books--and contribute to building our skills as readers and writers!

When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

My students are K through 6th grade at an inner-city school in Minneapolis with a diverse population including Hispanic, African American, and Somali students. We are an Open School where students are taught to be critical thinkers and give their own voice to each project they embark on. Hard working, enthusiastic, and extremely joyful, they devour all arts opportunities presented to them. They LOVE to create and perform and jump at the chance to share their creations. 'Orff Instruments' (in this project, xylophones) are specifically designed for elementary and middle school use. Students not only use them to learn and accompany known songs and pieces, but more importantly to create their own arrangements, compositions, and solos. They are a fabulously accessible instrument that allows all students to participate in music making. They also help dramatically in differentiation- students and the teacher can tailor learning to the needs of each student by making the music as simple or complex as appropriate. Students will perform large pieces in an ensemble, accompany songs in the classroom, and create their own arrangements and compositions. The general music program at our school is being rebuilt from the ground up- we started the year with an empty room. With extremely limited funds we are not able to purchase these, or many other, instruments and classroom supplies. Ideally, someday we will have one instrument for each student in the class.

We also have over 90% free and reduced lunch and many homeless and highly mobile students. But, my students are eager to succeed in learning and life! To keep my students engaged and excited about learning we do stations. During stations, small groups of students spend time working on a specific skill, like phonics. Twenty minutes later, we rotate to a new station to practice another skill, vocabulary. The same is true for math, students rotate from working on money, to telling time, to using numbers. Stations allow students to practice multiple skills, and work cooperatively with others. Using stations, I am able to meet with smaller groups of students or even one on one to reach students who need extra support in a given area. Stations provide a predictable routine for students, with embedded cooperative learning skills, and academic challenge. My students love stations! They love the easy rotation structure and routine in the classroom. One thing they are missing is a little more fun! The student are kind and act like they don't mind my old dice, or different worksheets, but I know they would love some more engaging activities.

These books will also be used during independent reading time, allowing groups of students to support one another as they practice their reading together. This collection includes informational books about high-interest topics to 2nd and 3rd graders as well as folktales from many different cultures. Students will gain confidence as readers as they learn about this wondrous and diverse world we live in.

8b2bfeedb9559808c10d0b7b9ca16e40,Reading Corner,"My students are special not only because of the unique differences and daily challenges they face. Yet they still come and try their best at school and are motivated to learn (most of them). We are a neighborhood school in a low socioeconomic neighborhood, serving less than 400 students. We are 99% free and reduce lunch; mostly Hispanic and African American. My students deserve the best yet we are not given essential materials or help. I also serve a split level classroom this year with first and second grade students. Students love that difference in the approach for learning. Doing something other than sitting at a desk in a chair. Students have an opportunity with the fun chairs, a bench, and mats to lay on and just enjoy reading. At a young age it is so very important to children to love learning or in this case love reading. I would love to be able to create that space for them here. As we work on independent learners, I want them to be comfortable; and these materials/furniture will help my students with that. Having a different place to go will help them feel like they are doing something different than what they usually do.","My students need Something different.

Their reading levels are diverse as well, ranging from kindergarten through 6th grade. My students are eager to read about this amazing world in which we live. My school is an urban option school that parents can choose for their children. I have many students with special education needs including learning disabilities, Autism-Spectrum Disorder, Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD. These special needs can impact their ability to read at grade-level. My students love reading about their world. They especially enjoy reading books about topics that interest them. It can be frustrating for kids who aren't yet reading higher-level texts, however, because they want to be able to read about their interests, too. Our classroom library just doesn't have enough books at the lower levels these kids need. The collection of books I am requesting includes informational books about topics of high interest to 2nd and 3rd graders. While high-interest, the books are at a lower reading level so they can be accessed by all students. My students will use these books during our daily Reading Workshop. The sets will be used for guided reading when the students will receive reading support in a small group from a teacher. The other books will be used during independent reading time so children can read about topics that interest them. Students will gain confidence as readers as they learn about this wondrous world we live in. These nonfiction books will help them be engaged and excited about reading!

Our students come from all kinds of families and from all over the world. We have students that live in the neighborhood and many that have just moved to our country. Our school is filled with terrific students and dedicated staff. Our parents are very involved in the education of the students and all of us want to help our students develop into healthy, active learners and good citizens of the world. This is our 2nd year taking our awesome 5th grade learners to the Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center in Northern Minnesota. Last year's trip was such an amazing experience that we knew that we had to do it again! We have a very diverse group of students that love new experiences and adventures! Wolf Ridge is a great place for them to experience the outdoors in ways that they have not done in the cities. We have a great number of students that are new to our country or are from backgrounds that haven't had the same opportunities as other students. When we get to Wolf Ridge none of that matters! All of the students are trying new things and experiencing the outdoors and all that it offers! ",My students need an opportunity to leave the city and head north!

My school is an urban option school that parents can choose for their children. I have many students with special education needs including learning disabilities, Autism-Spectrum Disorder, Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD. These special needs can impact their ability to access the skills and concepts I am teaching. During our independent reading time each day, my students find spots around our classroom to read their books. Two or three kids get to be cozy in our classroom library, but the remaining children have to sit on the floor or at their tables. Bean bags and wobble cushions will allow more kids to have comfortable spots for reading. And when they feel comfortable, they will be more focused readers! In addition, when small groups meet with me for individualized instruction, they will no longer have to gather around me on the floor. Instead, they will have stools on which to sit.

They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. Our band program has been expanding so quickly that I do not have enough instruments for my students. Since starting at my school in 2012, the number of students in band has grown from 38 to over 200! This is a great problem to have, but even after years of generous donations by countless individuals, finding affordable used instruments, and borrowing/trading with other schools, we still don't have enough instruments for every student who wants to be in band. These trumpets would mean three students who can't otherwise afford an instrument will be able to participate in band. These instruments will not only give the students that play them an enriching opportunity to learn the trumpet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing one of these trumpets could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music. This project will bring three trumpets into my classroom and into the hands of students who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford this experience.
