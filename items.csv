However,once you are submerged in the language,it feels great to be successful. One of the ways to achieve success in a new language is to use the most important,and most basic instrument;reading. I'm proud to say that my students are really bright and constantly seeing intellectual challenges. I teach in a Spanish Immersion school where students learn math, science, and cultural studies completely in Spanish. Half of their academic day is spent immersed in the language,while the other half of the day is in English. My school is part of a very low income district where the resources are never plentiful enough. We must constantly supplement the instruction to keep our students engaged and active in the learning process. I have a very limited Spanish literature resources to introduce to my 6th graders. I want them to be in the habit of reading, as I think this is the key to learning a new language. ItÂ´s amazing how involved they get into reading literature in a different language once they get started. It makes me so happy to see that even though they struggle through,they never give up. I plan to use these resources to continue and will allow students to discuss literature,and even debate,topics in a different language. These materials will given them access to thousands of new words. Giving students the opportunity of reading new material in a new language is both challenging and exciting. This will allow them to expand their vocabulary in two language.

And while you're at it, learn how to use quotation marks in your writing!Our city school serves children from all socio-economic levels in its Montessori, Designed Instruction, and regular classrooms. My students all struggle with reading, writing, and mathematics because they have a learning, health, or other disability. They are the best kids in the world, and I love to find ways to make their hard work pay off quicker and in multiple ways. Reading today's Comic-Style books has so many benefits. The words are leveled, the graphics are designed to teach emotional response ('read that with expression' just became easier) and strong story lines show all the elements of a good story. And BONUS! We can use them to understand just what goes into those pesky quotation marks classroom teachers demand third graders to use. With these Comic-style books, my students will also learn how to analyze plot, storyline, and problem/solution. This will make sense as they learn to plan their own writing.I've seen my students learn to read, and many use the stories we've read to provide a basis for their own writing. This is GOOD! Now my classroom needs books that will enable them to do this at a lower level. The TOON books, several of which have won awards, will make that easier.

In order to create a comfortable reading environment for my students I am asking for beanbag chairs, reading pillow seats, and a rocking chair that all of my students can use when they curl up on the floor to read. These new seating options will give my students the opportunity to spread out in the library during reading time and still be comfortable. By being more comfortable, they will also be more engaged in their reading and be more motivated to curl up and enjoy a good book.

Although it was filled with graphics and colorful pictures, often it was hard to read and comprehend. With your help, my students won't have to experience frustration reading nonfiction text. I am starting a new adventure with a new district and a new campus! The campus I will be attending is a Title 1 school. This means that most of the students I will be serving will come from low socioeconomic environments that face many challenges. The school serves about 900 students and 85 percent are on free/reduced lunch. We also have a large number of refugees that attend our school. Most of my students face academic challenges due to their backgrounds and home lives. Among these challenges are dyslexia, slow-learners, learning disabilities, and language. However, I will also have students who are on and above grade-level that would benefit from this enrichment. I am determined to meet the needs of ALL my students. For many decades, reading and writing has mostly been composed of make believe; fairytales, talking animals, and magic. Students find themselves addicted to these types of text as well as movies. They rarely run to the nonfiction section of the library. It is important that I teach my students the importance of factual information and how to summarize and decide what's important. Although my students are in 3rd grade I want them to be college ready! Being able to comprehend informational and expository text is a must-have skill for college and for life. The Research and Respond Comprehension center will allow my students to increase their comprehension skills with 3 easy steps: preview, read, and respond. After these steps they are required to respond to follow-up questions that reinforce the content. My students will be exposed to high-interest text that I'm sure they will love to read! Maybe they'll even explore the nonfiction section of the library! Research shows that although students are reading on an average of 25 minutes a day, only 4-5 minutes are allocated to nonfiction.

The majority of the students in my classroom do not own any type of technology at home and consequently do not have knowledge of saving a document or using the web for research. Computer time in our school is limited due to the fact that all classrooms are competing to use 1 computer cart that holds only 30 computers! That's why this project is important to us!

They will discover different ways to sort them and share their ideas with the class. Then they will learn the names of shapes by saying them aloud as they toss shape beanbags back and forth. Next, we will learn about quadrilaterals. They will get to make their own on a geoboard. After that they will have new ideas for sorting, and can return to the pattern blocks to put their ideas to use! With the clay they will be able to create shapes.

My classroom houses many different cultural backgrounds of students-students who speak different languages besides english, low income, and high income. It doesn't matter the race or age of these students. I have one goal in mind-to build a lifelong love of reading. If my students had chromebooks, they could access digital content. My students could access their literature series and take advantage of all of the digital components: note taking, access lessons, take tests/quizzes and receive immediate feedback, and annotate their thinking as they read.

They love saying 'hello' from different parts of the world. One of my challenges is to teach them about the world around them. This is one of many ways I teach multiculturalism. My students are bright five-year-olds. They love school and they love to learn. Often at my school I have to gather resources on my own to make the learning fun and relevant, but it is so worth it. When I see how engaged my students are in the learning, it's priceless. My school is in a low income community. All of the students qualify for free lunch. Many of my students live in the neighborhood. They consider the school, 'their school' and they absolutely love being there. My students and their parents know how important learning and being college and career ready is. At any point, you could come in my room and ask, 'What's more important than learning?' and they will reply, 'Nothing!' Another catch-phrase I say to them is, ' We're getting the knowledge..' and they respond, 'to go to college.' Beginning in Kindergarten, I want my students to already have the mindset they are going to college. I want them to learn about not just their community, but the World Community. These magazines are for kindergarten learners. These magazines allow my students to learn about the world around them in a fun, colorful, and inquisitive way. Two of the magazines infuse the learning around social studies topics that are engaging and current events. The science magazine will pique the interest of those little scientists in my classroom and nourish those inquisitive minds. My students will be able to read most of the magazine on their own. They will participate in group talks about what they have learned and ask questions about the information they read to their peers. What amazing book talks they could have around this nonfiction reading material. These magazines also teach map skills, geography, math, phonics, and many comprehension strategies. Funding this project will allow me to teach my students about the world around them using colorful, kid-friendly, and inviting photographs. They will see students the same age as them, in different parts of the world, learning, living, and growing. If my students are allowed to get their hands on these magazines, I feel they will have an even more appreciation for nonfiction, social studies, and the sciences. They are already eager to learn.

I try to create an environment where students take pride in their classroom and design it to their artistic and individual personalities. In our classroom, students' own beautiful works of art decorate the walls. My students are bright, active, and sweet young learners. They are eager to learn whatever it is that I am willing to share. Although academics is a large part of the curriculum, I like to incorporate art and fun crafts to each lesson in order to keep the creativity alive in my classroom. I believe that it is just as important to keep students engaged with the arts - especially since budget cuts keep cutting costs in music, art, and physical education. I am currently a 1st grade teacher working in a Title One school in Los Angeles, Ca, where many students receive free or reduced lunch. My class also serves English Language Learners and a few students who receive extra support from the Resource Specialist for various needs. With a variety of abilities and disabilities in my classroom, it is important to provide my class with additional resources in order to meet the needs of all students and to keep them engaged in the curriculum. All of these materials will be used in the classroom and will benefit all of my students. With these materials, students will explore their individuality and create masterpieces in which they will be able to take home and treasure with family and friends. I truly enjoy incorporating art with academic lessons. By doing so, I am able to keep students engaged and students are able to explore their artistic and creative capabilities. With the beads, jewels, and gems, students can create beautiful works of art. Moreover, they can also practice creating patterns with numbers, size, color, and so much more. While working with these materials, students also practice developing their fine motor skills while they cut, arrange, and manipulate various objects with their tiny, little fingers and hands. With these materials, you would provide so much more than what you would think to these students. You are giving them art, education, creativity, individuality, fine motor skills, and so much more. The donations to this project will truly help my students gain a sense of individuality in our classroom of twenty-five first grade students.

They are perfect for students of all ability levels, not to mention the fun and enjoyment my students get when reading them. Their confidence will soar when they see that everyone can read!

I will use the materials in whole-group situations as models and teaching tools. The materials will be used in small-groups, interventions, and center groups for students to understand key concepts and ideas in both language arts and math. Listed below are some of the materials and how they will be used. Phonics Stamps: The skill-building stamps each feature a picture and a corresponding word with the beginning, middle or ending sound missing. Kids stamp out each image and then fill in the missing letter to complete the word. Measuring Center: Students get an instant, visual grasp of measurement concepts like length and width as they conduct simple investigations with this hands-on center.

My resource room pulls students with disabilities from behavior, designed instruction, and regular classrooms. What we do to help students has to be quick, thorough, deep, and practical. The Common Core standards require children to become good communicators. Too many of my struggling learners can't even tell a story without support.

My students have some disadvantages in their life but at the end of the day, all they want to do is learn. They are passionate about discovering what they don't know and learning more about what they already understand. Please help make this a reality for them! My classroom is comprised entirely of students with severe behavior issues across 3 grade levels. Included in my classroom are a number of students with severe ADHD and other behaviors that have greatly impacted their learning. These students do not respond to traditional pencil and paper learning. I teach in a self-contained classroom, my students come to me from around my district after they have struggled in their home school. The school that I am at has a staggeringly high poverty rate, and my entire room is comprised of high poverty students. Many of my students feel like they have been written off by every adult in their lives. They all desperately desire to learn, though, and are hungry for a chance to read. Throughout their lives they've been made to feel like learning is something that they never will be able to achieve, but they are passionate to prove those naysayers wrong. My hope with this project is to continue using an alternative way to engage my students in learning. Throughout my building, teachers are experimenting with technology as a way to reach some of our most reluctant learners, including students with severe ADHD. We are seeing tremendous success with unique forms of technology that students in our building have no opportunity to see at home. In our room we have 3 NOOKS and they are always being used. Students are always clamoring to use them, and I simply can't keep up with demand. Students who previously refused to read are reading entire novels and novel series. These NOOKS have been game changers for us. The iPad mini will be a great teaching tool to help differentiate learning and continue to get students reading. There are a number of applications geared to reading that my students would greatly benefit from. This will be immensely important in a multi-age classroom where students are working at all different levels. My students need an iPad Mini to give them a more engaging way to interact with literature, alternative learning, and technology. Finding a way to engage my students in their own education is my greatest challenge, and this resource will make that challenge more attainable for so many more of my students.

Hands-on learning and exploration is needed to ensure that my students truly understand the math they are doing. My classroom is full of 29 fourth graders who are eager to learn and explore. Our classroom is comprised of Pacific Islanders, African Americans and Latinos. Many of my students are on free and reduced lunch and live in a neighborhood where they have seen far more than any ten year old should. Despite the realities of what occurs outside my classroom, my students come ready to learn each day. The Common Core has changed what is expected of our children in schools and math is seeing a huge shift in expectations. No longer are students required to memorize standard algorithms and endure mass quantities of calculations to prove they understand. Students are being encouraged to be problem solvers and critical thinkers. Furthermore, they are asked to solve problems through perseverance and modeling with mathematics while attending to precision and explaining their thinking. Pattern blocks and base ten blocks can be used across the four operations and for developing an understanding of fractions and decimals and allow for students to concretely model the math. It allows them to explore, question, make mistakes, and revise their thinking as they tackle a math problem. These hands-on materials (pattern blocks and base ten blocks) will allow my students to not only explore math content, but develop and strengthen their understanding of essential math concepts.

They struggle to overcome hurdles their disabilities have given them, both academic and behavioral, but when they succeed, they shine. It takes specially trained staff, individualized curriculum, designed instruction, and adapted materials to teach my students.

The Apple iPads will primarily be used inside my classroom through Kindergarten Literacy Center time where I will enforce their literacy skills through apps that enrich alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, reading and reading comprehension. With a splitter, each iPad will be used with 2 students at a time collaborating together to enhance these skills. The Apple iPads and iPad protectors will also be used for class intervention groups for at risk students in Language Arts and Math inside my classroom.

We have a lot of military families, low poverty and high poverty, single parent families or no parent families, homeless families, and a big population of Malti-cultural families. Because of this our school is extremely community and family oriented. We want to do everything we can to make sure every student is being included and feels safe and able to learn. One thing I have noticed is either students love to read because they have access to do so, or students hate to read because of their inability to do so. This inability can come from a lack of access to reading materials outside of the classroom. I want students to be able to use the kindles as another way to read books they love.

I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I would love to have Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They would also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. Students could build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class will inspire teamwork, encourage perseverance, and promote a positive attitude towards solving math problems. Learning to persevere through problem situations is invaluable to my students. For most of them, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life. They are healthier emotionally and intellectually. When you're a reader, anything is possible. Please help our students realize this.

I'm hoping to eliminate a lot of the frustrations my students experience in my Tech classes when they use our old robots by updating our set to the new and improved EV3 versions. We live in a rural Idaho community that still values 'vocational' education. My students are interested in learning skills they can use in their daily lives - possibly even for making a living. We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. With these new robots, students will be able to quickly and easily test out programs they've written. Most of the robots we currently use do not have working screens, and several of them have worn ports causing poor connections to motors and sensors. Being able to 'plug and play' will allow them to go further in their experimentation, and not only learn how the sensors work but also see what they see! With this knowledge I hope they will also be able to adapt their programs to compete in a classroom 'challenge' to see whose robot can navigate the maze. Technology changes at the speed of light. Having a new set of classroom robots will help my students keep up with the ever expanding field and give them an edge as they continue their education.

This year I started teaching a new program for Algebra 1 called Intensified Algebra designed for students who have struggled in math. In order to be successful in this program, students need to have graphing calculators. Please help us be successful! My students are freshmen and sophomores in high school who have struggled in math and never passed a math class. Now that they are in high school, and math is a must in order to graduate, they are struggling as they don't have the foundational math skills to pass a math class. This course is designed to help solidify their basic math skills as well teach them all of the Algebra 1 skills needed at the high school level. These students are with me for two periods in a row (110 minutes) to maximize the content that we cover. Over the course of the year, we will cover foundational math skills from 6th, 7th, and 8th grade, as well as the Algebra 1 skills needed to move onto geometry. Many of the lessons in our curriculum require students to have graphing calculators. These lessons teach the students how to use different components of the graphing calculator. Our school has graphing calculators to use, but they are for students in higher math classes. Many of my students don't have the funds to purchase graphing calculators so teaching these lessons has been a challenge. It would be a huge benefit to my students to be able to learn how to successfully use a graphing calculator, instead of watching my use one under the document camera. My students have lacked confidence in math their entire lives. The curriculum I am teaching from is really helping to provide my students with skills and confidence to go out and be successful. In order to get the most out of this program, my students need access to the correct tools. Providing them with graphing calculators with give them a little more confidence to be successful.

The girls are in need of a calming, mindful space. The young ladies who will be participating in this course are in need of a space to practice mindful behavior as well as explore strategies for being more self-aware in order to be the best version of themselves possible. This group of girls needs the little extra push and support in order to realize their full potential academically. This course will provide the girls with strategies for calming down and relaxing and how to use these strategies to make good decisions. There will also be a yoga component that will enable discussions and activities around health and wellness in both mind and body. The meditation activities will be used to teach the girls calming and relaxation strategies as well as to set a positive tone each day. Girls will learn how to calm the mind in order to think more mindfully about themselves and others in their interactions and decisions. We will practice meditative sketching and coloring, as well. The students will also use the sketchbook as a reflective journal. Each day we will write an intention in the sketchbook and use it at a space to reflect on progress. Additionally, the meditation readings will serve to present the girls with positive messages and inspirations each day that they can take with them into their lives outside of the classroom. There is a need in urban education to provide more differentiated support to students, especially those who need that little extra push in order to realize their deepest potential. Research is also revealing the benefits of mindful and meditation practices in schools, especially with developing middle school students. My school, and under my teacher leadership, has already implemented a similar program with boys. This program enables us to reach our young ladies who will also benefit greatly.

My students have been identified as gifted in Mathematics. They come to me every day for their math instruction. They are so much fun. They love to learn and still get excited about new activities. I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I love having Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. With the addition of the cubelets students will build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class inspires teamwork, encourages perseverance, and promotes a positive attitude towards solving math problems. For most of my students, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated. I want them to experience the true self-esteem that comes from sticking with hard problems.

Many students do not have Internet access at home, and some live in a mobile home community. I have several gifted and talented students eager to create and learn. Although they come from various backgrounds, one thing they have in common is their enthusiasm to learn. They are an energetic, and a very gracious group. Dash & Dot robots are hands-on learning tools that teach creativity, problem solving, and coding to children. Children can see their code come to life in a real-world, hands-on way that engages them fully in the concepts they are learning about. As robotics and computers become increasingly prevalent in students’ lives, understanding programming concepts is becoming very important for students’ success. Students will work in small groups to develop their collaboration and communication abilities as they learn valuable 21st century skills.

I keep them moving as much as I can, but at times they have to sit and learn. These students living situations aren't always ideal for them to get out their energy and move around unfortunately. Many are stuck living in small apartments with a large family and no yard to run around in. Several of my students have ADHD as well. It really is a struggle and constant battle for these students to be in a classroom without moving much throughout the day. Many students constantly struggle with having to sit still all day long in the classroom. Often times they end up getting in trouble because of it.

It is nice having the ability to move around even if it is just a little bit. I would eventually love to have an entire class set of these stools. These stools will be used on a daily basis by all students as they rotate through small groups in math and reading. I can also use them throughout the regular instruction day when I have those students who just need that extra movement.

Your donation of magnetic letters and boards will help beginning readers make connections to reading and writing. The magnetic letters on the white boards will help them practice their alphabet, letter sounds, word families and sight words. By working with words on a daily basis I have no doubt that all of my students will become fluent readers.

0c4df44a688cc024f2552f4653dae23d,"Cold, Clean, Filtered and Green: Water Bottle Filler Fountains!","Recently, three students, Azriel, Madeline, and Deiny approached me from the School Wellness Council proposing we raise money to get new water fountains in our building. Water is something many people take for granted in day to day life. However at our school, water is a common complaint amongst our students. Many of our students opt to not drink any water during the day rather than drink the warm tinted water that comes from our water fountains. The students at our school come from low-income homes making it hard to fund projects like this even though new water fountains would greatly help all of the students and staff in our school. The students have classes such as Physical Education that involve physical activity and staying hydrated is important. The students at our school spend all day working to ensure that they pass their classes and have a future, yet they are unable to have access to clean none the less cold water. Hydration is essential to life. Sadly, our students don't take the time or have the desire to properly hydrate themselves during school. The reason is simple. Bad water. The students hate drinking the dirty, warm water that our school water fountains provide. The students will have a better understanding of how important water is to their learning and health if they had cold, clean, filtered water at their disposal on a daily basis. The water bottle filler fountains also provide a green, waste free option which will help the environment in which the students live. Understanding how important it is to drink clean water and how important it is to save water, will give our students a better understanding of how they can help others who are in need of clean water and ways they can conserve and waste less. We are trying to get three cold filtered water bottle stations (one on each floor of our school) installed at our school. As members of the School Wellness Council our responsibility is to find ways to make our school and community healthier. Drinking clean, filtered, cold water throughout the school day is one way we want to help our community and school. Plus the water stations are waste free and thus saves our environment in the process. We are planning on selling water bottles for the Parent Teacher Student Association that will help raise funds for the PTSA. We will be responsible for collecting the money and promoting the use of the water bottles in the new water stations. We will also be educating our peers in the importance of staying hydrated throughout the school day. This information will be created and given during a school wide event by us students in the School Wellness Council. We believe that since our peers don't drink the school's water they instead are either drinking the 'sugar' free sodas provided in our school's vending machines or they are drinking nothing at all during the entire school day. We believe that providing water bottle stations that produce clean, filtered, cold water will increase the amount of water our peers will drink. This will keep them healthier and also provides them with a FREE drink option that is better and healthier than what the vending machines provide.

Children come and go throughout the day and throughout the year. Meeting every child's individual academic and social needs is a fun challenge. My day is never boring! My students are a wonderful group of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders attending a high-poverty, urban elementary school. They have a wide range of disabilities that make it challenging for them to learn exclusively in a general education setting. They come to my room for small group instruction in reading, writing, math, and/or social skills. Most of my students are also English language learners. My students rely on consistent routines and access to models and visual examples of the tasks they are completing. They depend on engaging learning experiences that meet them at their individual instructional levels and tap into their personal interests. Most importantly, they depend on having access to the resources that support their individual instructional needs. My biggest challenge as a special education teacher is providing my students with an ever-changing supply of reading materials at their individual reading levels and interests. My school's community is very supportive of all of our learners, but our budget is very tight. While we are fortunate to have a great leveled library, it doesn't have enough breadth for my learners, who take longer to progress from one reading level to another. Likewise, the titles that span the 2nd and 3rd grade reading levels are unlikely to appeal to my older students. In order to read more, they need access to reading material that piques their interest. That's where Storyworks and Time For Kids come in. Every week, my students will have access to Time For Kids' quality, up-to-date news, social studies, and science articles that are relevant for kids of all ages. Monthly, they will receive Storyworks literary magazine, packed full of fiction and non-fiction passages from well-known and up-and-coming authors, often paired with non-fiction passages or poems. With these high-quality resources I'm sure not to run out of materials for my learners. These materials will ensure that my students have non-stop access to high-quality reading material that will pique their imaginations and encourage them to read more, which is key to reading success.

The reason DCS is so small is because we are, in essence, a modern-day, one-room schoolhouse. Our students are taught every subject in mixed-grade classes. We find, with the right amount of differentiating the material for the older and younger students, the students mentor one another, find role models, observe what struggle and humility look like. Our students are on a constant search to nurture and satisfy their sense of intellectual curiosity. To them and their families, education is the first priority in life. Because of the economic hardships many of our families face, they understand the connection between receiving a high-quality education and achieving success in life. We consider our school's curriculum to be extremely rigorous, and our expectations of our students are high. Our school represents the rich ethnic and racial spectrum of the city of Newark. Our students and staff are African-American, Caribbean, Caucasian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern: Muslim, Protestant, Jewish and Catholic. There are students whose families have been in Newark for decades, and students whose families have just arrived here from abroad: all-in-all our school community represents over 30 countries from around the world.DCS kicks off the coming school year with a school-wide, interdisciplinary unit of study on our city: Newark, NJ. The title of the unit is 'Newark: Revolution, Rebellion and Rebirth'. One of the periods we will focus on in-depth is the Newark Riots of 1967, also known as the Newark Rebellion. I am seeking literature to teach in English Language Arts which will enrich the students' knowledge of that period in American history, specifically as it relates to the African-American's struggle for civil rights in the 1960s. The 'March' Trilogy is a perfect vehicle to teach my students one man's real-life account of social rebellion in the 1960s, written in a format to which they can relate easily. 'March' is a graphic novel, presented in three parts, the story of the life of Rep. John Lewis. The format of a graphic novel will gain critical buy-in from my students and give them an immediate feeling that the material is in an accessible format. The use of 'comic book' conventions, will naturally convey the urgency and drama of the events. I am positive that the combination of the powerful content of John Lewis' story and the inviting design of the graphic novel will give my students a vivid context through which to view what happened in Newark in July of 1967: how it could happen in America and why it had to happen.","My students need to study the 'March' trilogy, so they may analyze the trajectory of a life steeped in the social activism and racial turmoil of 1960s America.","History & Civics, Literacy & Language",Grades 6-8,Books,1017.21,Fully Funded

We work like scholars by sticking to the task and having a thirst for knowledge. We spend a lot of time developing number sense in first grade.

In the past, I had the students make their own Rekenraks using cardboard, pipe cleaners, and red and white pony beads. However, they don't hold up very well because we use them a lot. I would have to stop the lesson to help a child put their handmade Rekenrak back together. It took precious time away from the lesson.

Last year, I taught first grade and in the fall, I will be teaching Kindergarten. (The photo I have posted is from last year's class, as I have not met my class for next year yet.) My students are Kindergarteners. For some it will be their first experience with school, and I am looking forward to creating a warm and nurturing learning community for them! They will be 4 and 5 year-olds. They will be a community of curious, energetic, individual and unique children eager to make friends and learn new things! I'm so excited to meet my students in the fall!These wooden blocks will be a part of a play center in our classroom. Building with wooden blocks helps children develop fine motor skills, learn to be creative, problem-solve, work with others and nurtures a multitude of other skills! Play centers are also important for oral-language building skills, for instance, when children present their creations to the class and/or ask and answer questions about them.I believe play is very important for a Kindergartener's healthy holistic development. After recently reading the book Purposeful Play by Kristine Mraz, I learned about how all the different types of play are important for children in different ways.

Meeting our scholars, you would describe them as open-minded inquirers ready to take on new challenges. Our students are here because they choose to take on the challenge of an International Baccalaureate (IB) program that will effectively prepare them for college, a goal they might be the first in their families to achieve. These supplies will allow our scholars to learn without the distraction of needing basic materials. Funding of this project will allow me to better outfit my classroom with needed supplies while ensuring students have what they need to succeed. Students need composition books, pens, and pencils to annotate readings, interpret information, and draft essays that will be important to their success. Basic organization and classroom tools like baskets and an X-ACTO electric pencil sharpener will allow us all to complete our tasks more efficiently. We also need Kleenex tissues, Bounty towels, and Lysol Disinfecting Wipes to keep clean. While students in my classes will be studying government, economics, and psychology, they will be practicing important life skills like research, analysis, interview, and presentation.

Our students come from many cultures, various backgrounds, and speak many languages. We strive daily to empower our students to be leaders and to take charge of their learning. Many of our students come from backgrounds where stability and a safe environment is hard to find. It is our job to create an environment in our classrooms where our students feel safe and free to use their voice and advocate for their education. Our school continually strives to stay on the cutting edge of research to provide the best possible learning environment for our students.I am requesting items that will allow my students more seating options in my classroom. Through my years of teaching I have found that many students are not comfortable or engaged in the traditional classroom environment of tables and chairs. The use of yoga balls and wobble stools in the place of traditional chairs will allow students more comfort and the ability to move as they need to. Bean bag chairs and pillows will be used for students who prefer to learn closer to the ground or laying down. The large carpet will provide a comfortable place for students to gather for whole group instruction or collaborative team tasks. By providing a more flexible, student-centered seating arrangement, I am able to capitalize on valuable teaching opportunities for students who need to move often or who prefer to sit on the floor or stand as they learn. In the past I have been able to accommodate a few students in providing more flexible seating options and have seen the tremendous impact it made on their enjoyment of learning and motivation in the classroom. By gifting all of my students with these items it will give them the tools they need to maximize their potential as learners and leaders.

The rest of the students are native English speakers learning Spanish, becoming empowered and compassionate citizens by living and learning in another language, culture, and perspective. Many of my students struggle with issues of poverty and access to academic experiences. Fortunately, bilingual education is one of the best ways to close the achievement gap and to break down barriers of racism and socioeconomics! Actually, if a student is allowed to learn in their native language, they acquire English at a better and faster rate than those who do not. And they also have bilingual skills to share with the world and to learn about other cultures and perspectives! Unfortunately, I do not have sufficient materials in Spanish to help support their learning...this is why I need your help!

They will use the take home book bags to borrow these books to take home to share with their families, who are mostly Spanish speakers. The notebooks they will use to take notes and make maps about what they observe in their community and what needs to be improved. They will feel very important with their fancy folders, clipboards, and book bags, thus more likely they will use them and realize that they too have interesting ideas and input to share. We will write letters to community members and learn about our own community and different communities in our state.

As an international school, students spend half the day in Spanish or Mandarin language immersion classroom, and half in English Language Arts. Add to that the cultural and economic diversity of our families and you've got the recipe for a great education of what makes our multicultural society a magnet for people from around the world. Our library and information technology program inspires students and staff to integrate learning by every means available. As an International school, our library strives to introduce new resources into lives of students that reflect their home cultures and experiences bridging their family's home culture and dreams for success in America. Having a strong Library and Information Technology program helps open a world of learning. Thanks. In addition to all the print literacy activities we've come to expect in libraries, libraries are a great place for diving into digital literacy, too. OzoBots are a delightful starting place for introducing students to coding and robotics in the library. This starter kit gives us enough to provide an introduction for all students in our preK-5 public elementary school and a springboard to further investigation and instruction. Getting started coding using OzoBots lets our students enjoy the same interest-driven learning during school in ways that are too often left for after-school enrichment in more affluent communities. Our commitment to equity demands that we go the extra mile to provide rich learning experiences for all students. Thanks for helping us in accomplishing that goal.","My students need a simple entry into coding and robotics and Ozobot provides just that.

Setting up a classroom in the most efficient way possible allows students to focus on learning. As a wall-to-wall International Baccalaureate school, instructional time is very precious. Students are preparing for their IB exams, writing their extended essays, and doing community service. They are busy kids! As an IB teacher, I need to make sure my instruction is tailored to their needs, and that my classroom has the materials needed to help students succeed.I am requesting desk caddies for my students to use. In my classroom, students sit in groups of four to facilitate collaboration. Our class uses interactive notebooks every day, which require the use of scissors and glue. My students also frequently use highlighters, sticky notes, and dry erase markers for assessment activities. Having students get up to retrieve these items each day causes my class to lose valuable instructional time. By using desk caddies, my students will be able to efficiently transition between activities and gain more time for learning. In this project, each group will receive a desk caddy to organize their highlighters, sticky notes, and other tools needed for routine classroom activities.

My students come from a wide range of different cultures, backgrounds, and even different languages. Regardless of what language they speak at home, music is a language in which everyone can communicate and share. 'Music is the universal language of mankind.' Henry Wadsworth Longfellow could not have put it more accurately. Music allows me to communicate with all students. It does not matter what language they speak, what culture they are from, if they have a disability, etc. Music speaks to all, and through music, I can speak to all. The Orff-Schulwerk approach (or Orff approach) is a philosophy of teaching music. It is designed around what kids do best: play. In an Orff classroom, children move, sing, dramatize, play instruments, and more. This developmental approach to teaching music encourages students to explore, collaborate, and express themselves through music. The Orff approach helps students find the joy in performing, without feeling judged by their classmates or their teacher. Everyone is treated as equals, even in regards to solos. This encourages the students to enjoy making music alone and in groups. In order for me to become a certified Orff teacher, I have to take a two week long course during the summer. There are three levels of certification, and I will be doing my first level.

Our 1st grade students are eager and thoughtful learners- ready with the foundation they gained in kindergarten to fully launch into becoming readers, writers, mathematicians, and scientists. They have gracious hearts, resilient spirits, and limitless curiosities. We are lucky to be their 1st grade teachers. Our neighborhood is known to be one of the most diverse in the country and every classroom in our school reflects that gift. In addition to the richness that such diversity brings, we also recognize that different opportunities and experiences in early childhood can create inequitable beginnings for children in school. As a school community, we know without a doubt that all of our students are highly capable and work with determination to ensure that every student has the resources, instruction, and support necessary to achieve success. First grade is a time of tremendous growth for students. They launch from the building blocks of kindergarten to delve further into more complex thinking. In reading, they move from working with the alphabet and decoding words to making meaning of texts by making connections, comparing and contrasting characters, making inferences, and more. In math, they move from working on counting and using models like fingers and drawings to add and subtract to using a variety of strategies to mentally solve problems with greater and greater quantities. This rigorous work demands fluency both in reading words and in math facts. Our first grade classes use various computer programs to help our students develop this fluency.

Work is not work when you love what you do!“Since the beginning of time, children have not liked to study. They would much rather play, and if you have their interests at heart, you will let them learn while they play; they will find that what they have mastered is child’s play.” – Carl Orff The Orff approach teaches children through experiences in music, speech, and movement. Feelings precede theoretical knowledge. Students develop understandings from discovery. Their early music education often begins with experiencing rhythm through childhood chants and children’s’ rhymes. Children go on to explore music and movement in ways similar to “real life” musicians and dancers. Learning is structured so success is immediate. For example, children might play a steady beat drone on barred instruments to accompany a pentatonic song. These first harmonies echo the traditional instrument drones that historically have accompanied folk songs and tunes from nearly all cultures around the world. While very simple or elemental, these accompaniments are effective. As children accompany a song, improvise a melody, create a dance or work with musical forms, they are engaged in real-life tasks. Through joyful music making, movement and words children learn through child’s play. This professional development will increase my knowledge in this teaching method. It will allow me the skills to implement it in my Magnet Creative Arts School. I believe the students will benefit just as the founder stated, learning through singing, saying, dancing, and playing.
