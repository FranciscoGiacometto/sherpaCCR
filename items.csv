665,Ben-Hur,The entertainment experience of a lifetime.,"Ben-Hur is a 1959 epic film directed by William Wyler, the third film version of Civil War vet Lew Wallace's 1880 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.","action, adventure, drama, history","roman, prince, chariot race, jerusalem, governor, politics, epic, friends, revenge, jewish, galley, galley slave",1959,212,146900000.0,15000000.0,William Wyler,"Charlton Heston, Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Stephen Boyd, Hugh Griffith, Martha Scott, Cathy O'Donnell, Frank Thring, Sam Jaffe, Ady Berber, Finlay Currie, André Morell, Terence Longdon, Lando Buzzanca, Giuliano Gemma, Marina Berti, Robert Brown, Liana Del Balzo, Enzo Fiermonte, Richard Hale, Duncan Lamont, John Le Mesurier, Ferdy Mayne, May McAvoy, Aldo Silvani, Ralph Truman, George Relph, Joe Canutt, Richard Coleman, Antonio Corevi, David Davies, Mino Doro, Michael Dugan, Franco Fantasia, José Greci, John Horsley, Howard Lang, Stevenson Lang, Tutte Lemkow, Cliff Lyons, Tiberio Mitri, Remington Olmsted, Laurence Payne, Aldo Pini, Diego Pozzetto, Stella Rho, Edwin Richfield, Hector Ross, Maxwell Shaw, Gianni Solaro, Pietro Tordi, Raimondo Van Riel, Dervis Ward, Joe Yrigoyen, Nazzareno Zamperla, Jerry Brown, Eddie Jauregui",Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM),United States of America,14.319743,7.5,660,en,tt0052618,/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The actual villain, whose identity is never in doubt (Hitchcock made thrillers, not mysteries) is played by George Curzon, who suffers from a twitching eye. Curzon's revelation during an elaborate nightclub sequence is a Hitchcockian tour de force, the sort of virtuoso sequence taken for granted in these days of flexible cameras and computer enhancement, but which in 1937 took a great deal of time, patience and talent to pull off.

6547,Schtonk!,One of the first funny german look at its past.,"Schtonk! is a farce of the actual events of 1983, when Germany's Stern magazine published, with great fanfare, 60 volumes of the alleged diaries of Adolf Hitler – which two weeks later turned out to be entirely fake.  Fritz Knobel (based on real-life forger Konrad Kujau) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. When Knobel writes and sells a volume of Hitler's (nonexistent) diaries, he thinks it's just another job.  When sleazy journalist Hermann Willié learns of the diaries, however, he quickly realizes their potential value... and Knobel is quickly in over his head. As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting. The film is a romping and hilarious satire, poking fun not only at the events and characters involved in the hoax (who are only thinly disguised in the film), but at the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.","history, comedy","female nudity, nazi background, portrait painting, hitler's diaries",1992,115,0.0,0.0,Helmut Dietl,"Götz George, Uwe Ochsenknecht, Christiane Hörbiger, Harald Juhnke, Ulrich Mühe, Rolf Hoppe, Dagmar Manzel, Veronica Ferres, Hermann Lause, Martin Benrath, Georg Marischka, Karl Schönböck, Rosemarie Fendel, Wolfgang Menge, Hark Bohm, Willy Harlander, Thomas Holtzmann, Hans-Joachim Hegewald, Peter Roggisch, Günter Junghans, Armin Rohde, Michael Kessler, Martin Feifel","Bavaria Film, Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)",Germany,0.8656149999999999,6.7,16,de,tt0105328,/nhcbyqalhtDbbhnoKCYZdtOIRHk.jpg,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But with success came expansion and new owners, including a certain high profile and impatient real estate baron whose vision was at odds with the league’s founders. Soon, the USFL was reduced to waging a desperate anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, which yielded an ironic verdict that effectively forced the league out of business.

Strictly ADULT Film Fare!,"In this third installment of the ""Olga"" series, our heroine adds jewel smuggling to her repertoire of dope pushing and white slavery. As the vicious Olga (Audrey Campbell) expands her criminal empire, she also encounters more resistance as a string of once-trusted partners turn traitor in an effort to steal the successful racket out from under her. The result is exactly what fans of the series expect, a barrage of torture scenes featuring soldering irons, floggings, spankings, and even an electric chair. As with its predecessors, Olga's House of Shame is a silent black and white film with narration to explain the action, but even with direct commentary it's difficult to keep track of the characters and Campbell (who is occasionally caught laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all) has all the menace of a kindergarten teacher, even when wielding a machete.","crime, drama","prostitute, vaginal sex, torture",1964,70,0.0,0.0,Joseph P.
