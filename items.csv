2274d68de7068287375b9d025ceba625,Collaboration Station in the RJE Learning Commons,"We are acquiring more and more technology at RJE, mobile technology, in particular. While this is exciting, we struggle to find spaces for students to use it. I feel that if we have a fun, kid friendly space that will facilitate an environment of collaboration and teamwork, kids will flock to it! RJE has 636 students, and they are very social. They love to play together and work together. In fact, teachers encourage students to work together to encourage cooperation and compromise. It also allows our students to learn from one another. They like the affiliation aspect of learning. My goal is to use our collaboration station area for working in groups, particularly with technology. We are fortunate to have many iPads on our campus that are intended for student use. With the collaboration station, students could use our tablets or other devices and collaboratively work on a project. They could even use this shared space to visit and communicate with students outside of our campus via Skype or Face Time. The furniture that I am requesting will facilitate a coworking environment and encourage children to work together and use our mobile technology in a collaborative, cooperative way. I would be thrilled to offer my students this modern learning space for their studies. I want to provide a book store or coffee house setting that will appeal to our 21st century learners as well as accommodate discussions and our mobile technology. I am requesting a 5 piece Wesco Modular Square Soft Seater that sits low to the ground and will accommodate up to 8 students and/or staff. Each piece is a bright color and there is a center piece for materials and such. Currently, we have rectangular tables, which are well suited for classes and meetings, but they are not ideal for a small group, who may want to meet privately and/or have small group discussions. With the furniture that I am requesting, the seating will be perfect for small groups that are working on a project together, and a perfect place for students to use mobile technology together. If RJE receives this seating option, I will complete the collaboration station by adding a stationary iPad. I want to provide our students with furniture that will be fun and colorful. Schools must align their classroom environments with real world environments in order to prepare our students for the future. To do that, schools must practice the 4 Cs: critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity. My students need a go to space to work together that will allow them to talk, ask questions, and practice their critical thinking skills. I want to provide a setting that will appeal to our 21st century learners and accommodate collaboration at its finest!

We need your help to supply our special education classroom with some working technology to help contribute to the success of our students. Our school district is based in a low income town. Our middle school has a specific program called the Target program. The Target program supports students with emotional disorders. Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly. Our students deserve a chance to interact with today's technology and they deserve to do so in fast and productive manner. If our students have the opportunity to learn 21st century skills, they will be able to practice skills that can be used in their bright futures. The information they will be able to learn, and the creativity they will be able to channel through a computer will help meet many of their educational goals.

The iPad compliments all learning styles and can be used across all content areas. Our Elementary has four kindergarten sections of approximately 22 students a total of 76 kindergarteners. They are full of energy, enthusiasm, and a desire to learn! The goal of the grant is to use the iPads to improve student achievement across all populations. The touch screen facilitates easy use for tiny fingers still developing fine motor skills. The highly visual and animated delivery of iPad educational apps captures their imagination, motivates their desire to learn, and provides the authentic use of technology to master essential knowledge and skills. We are requesting three iPads. One of our teachers previously received an iPad through a grant. If this Donors Choose project is funded, the iPads will be placed permanently in each classroom. The use of the iPads will offer a plethora of appealing, hands-on learning experiences that will facilitate the mastery of kindergarten skills. The iPads will be utilized by independent student use in literacy and math stations. Students could use Tellagami, Videolicious, or Puppet Pals app to retell or create their own fairy tale. Another possibility would be to use Educreations app to describe the plant cycle or their animal research. Haiku Deck could be used to show their learning about landforms or science tools. The possibilities are endless! We want to provide a technology tool that will appeal to our 21st century learners, enhance instruction, and increase student learning. Growth with Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) scores and math performance tasks scores will be indicators of the success of the iPads.

My classroom houses many different cultural backgrounds of students-students who speak different languages besides english, low income, and high income. It doesn't matter the race or age of these students. I have one goal in mind-to build a lifelong love of reading. If my students had chromebooks, they could access digital content. My students could access their literature series and take advantage of all of the digital components: note taking, access lessons, take tests/quizzes and receive immediate feedback, and annotate their thinking as they read.

This is our classroom in a nutshell. By adding iPods to our classroom, the students will have the opportunity to engage in reading in a new way! Using iPods will allow them to listen and follow along with the readers words. Children love listening to reading and by focusing in on the reader, the students are given a rich, fluent example to follow in return.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life. They are healthier emotionally and intellectually. When you're a reader, anything is possible. Please help our students realize this.

My dream is to set up my classroom like a coffee shop. When you go into a coffee shop to do some work, you have choice. I don't have someone telling me my spot for the remainder of my time there. I have the choice to pick my seat. I also have the choice to change my mind and sit somewhere else during my time at the coffee shop.

The books on the list are of various difficulty but picked to challenge students. Teams are formed and they compete in a day of competition answering questions about the books they read. Eventually, it comes down to two teams and a final battle. After the final battle a winner is crowned! It is a fun and exciting event that we hope to continue for years to come. In order for us to continue the competition we need multiple copies of high interest but challenging books for our next competition. One of the awesome things about Battle of the Books is that students can read the books individually or teachers can read them with their class. The book and audiobook (so students can listen to the book and follow along) that I am requesting is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The students at my school love the Harry Potter series but many have not read the books but have seen the movies. We all know the movie version of a book is often very different from the book itself. There are only a few loved copies of the book in our library. As soon as the books come, teachers and students from all grade levels will be able to have access to them and get a start on the next Battle of the Books.",My students need Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to unleash their imagination and take them to a magical world.,Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Books,372.24,Fully Funded

These kids are from the North Woods and love the outdoors, especially the lakes, rivers, and forests that surround us. My classroom consists of approximately 30% Native American students. Our district motto is to ACHIEVE, and my class does that daily through academics, character, and behavior. I am continually impressed at how motivated my students are when it comes to their learning. They are always up for a good challenge! High-interest books are an important piece of the literacy puzzle. Brian P. Cleary's books have a way of hooking a reader and making them want more. That's why our classroom would love more Brian P. Cleary books. The titles we already have are constantly flying off the shelf! Any time we can get a child interested in a book, it is a win! The titles we don't have in our classroom library are mostly science themed or themed around the food groups. Not only will these books help my students improve their reading skills, but they will have the opportunity to learn about life science, math, and health.","My students need grammar, math, and science books by Brian P.

They are amazing kids and families that deserve the best! They work hard and have great attitudes! They need extra support physically and financially to help them be successful. One hundred percent of our students receive free breakfast and lunch. Their lack of resources does not stop their drive to learn. They are motivated kids that once they have the proper tools their success is endless. My 3rd grade classroom loves to read. They are at an age where their imaginations run wild and they can fall into a book and become a part of it within the first few pages. Reading takes them to new places and exposes them to different times and cultures. Our students come from a low poverty community and go without in many things in their lives. I would love to provide them with a classic award winning books that is coming out as a movie next year! 'A Wrinkle in Time', is a classic I remember reading when I was their age, and it will let their imagination run wild. Not only will this provide them with a wealth of knowledge, it will also help them become better writers and learn from other Authors. Reading is power and providing new titles means the world to them. These books will make a big difference for our classroom and will light up their passion to read. We will be using the items in collaborative centers during our Reader's workshop and Writer's workshop daily. Reading truly is a dream with open eyes. It allows our students to have experiences they may never have in their real lives. Please help us provide new resources for our classroom.

These kids are like my family and our room is full of kindness and love. These children live in a rural area and are part of working families doing the best they can. They are sweet, caring, kind and lovable!!! They try their best everyday and are very creative. They love to learn and come to school. Children need to have and make choices! Having this new carpet will give them better seating options and the freedom to be the learner they want and need to be. By allowing them to choose where the learning best suits them and having the control to make their own decisions, they can take charge of their own learning. Our carpet will provide comfort, space and will be able to be used as a learning tool where the children can use the letters for recognition and sound sorting centers.

Most of all they want to learn and do their best. Our students are encouraged to questions, imagine possibilities, work collaboratively, create innovative solutions and always look for ways to improve. We are a STEAM based charter school in Wake Forest, North Carolina. We believe in hands-on, real world, problem-based learning. Students in middle school are given a concept or scenario and are asked to become engineers, using the engineering design process, to tackle the problem with creative solutions, while learning the required Common Core Standards. I love being able to give my students choice in their learning. Giving them the option of choosing which seating style helps them learn best will make them feel motivated and confident to learn all throughout the school day. My students would love having wobble chairs and wobble cushions as an alternative seating method, so they can move around while they are working without distracting their classmates. These have been very popular in my classroom because it allows students the ability to stay engaged in learning while moving and not distracting their peers. Not all students learn the same way, so we cannot expect all students to sit the same way. A comfortable learning environment is crucial to making students feel comfortable in the classroom. My students would benefit greatly from having flexible seating options, and I know it will make a great difference in their learning.

With a large population of of students who do not regularly see a wide variety of ethnicities and cultural representations, it is crucial that children see others represented in literature in order to broaden their understanding of the world. As with most public schools, we have limited resources to fund our library and this is an area where all students would benefit in our school. I am asking for these book sets to significantly increase the cultural representation of students in literature in 5 classroom libraries. The goal is to have five separate sets of books that can rotate between our classrooms throughout the year increasing the number of excellent books available and the number of students exposed to this rich text. We will purchase books based on excellence in content and story that represent marginalized groups as authors and illustrators as well as main characters in stories.

We are located in an area where the socioeconomic status of many residents is low. Many students have parents who are out of work. Our school relies heavily on state funding and this year, we are struggling once again due to the state not coming through with that funding. Programs and teachers are being cut and our students are feeling the brunt. Our students are creative and kind and they strive to reach their goals no matter what obstacles they face. They continue to achieve successfully despite more challenges and fewer resources. They forge ahead without complaints. Although funds are low, our students' passion for books hasn't dulled one bit. Please help keep this thirst for literature alive by supporting our school. Strong literacy skills help students excel in every aspect of their personal and professional lives. Providing fresh fiction and nonfiction books in our library will help spark students' interest in reading, thus encouraging them to become strong, lifelong readers. Our educators work harder every year to strengthen our sustained silent reading program and encouraging students to read in their free time. The more resources we have in our library, the more likely the kids will be to embrace this program and not only find something that meets their reading needs, but also helps them embrace being a reader for life.

I am writing to you as a Special Education Teacher from a small rural school with a total school population of 138 students in grades K-4 through 5th grade. Of these students 70% receive free or reduced lunch. My students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and all have a vary diverse set of educational needs. What has been astounding to me as I continue to work with the students at my school is their willingness to read, and their spark for joining clubs and activities that involve reading here at school! When I started as the Special Education teacher this year I thought it may be fun to start a small book club to promote literacy school wide, what I did not anticipate was the amount of interest the Book Club would generated! The students who joined the Book Club have done so simply because they love to read, and I want to continue to help foster their love for reading and books!Unfortunately, to have a successful Book Club we need books! We need sets of books so that the students can partner and read in pairs. The students work diligently setting goals and reading!Reading is a transferable skill that is needed to make gains in all areas of life. Having students who are passionate about reading makes me, as an educator, excited to come to work each and everyday. Not having the funds to provide my students with the simplest resources needed, such as books, is difficult. By supplying students with books and encouraging them to continue to read, I hope that they will see that there are not limits when you truly put your mind to something. I hope to set an example for the students and encourage growth both in reading and socially!","My students need BOOKS, BOOKS, and more BOOKS!

Many students receive free or reduced-price lunch and students come from homes with limited opportunity for enrichment and exploration beyond the school walls. Beyond just a steady focus on helping students successfully meet mandated academic standards, I want to provide creative outlets for learning. Providing opportunities for growth in problem-solving skills, communication, and collaboration will help these students become successful adults. My position as a resource teacher allows me to work with a wide range of students throughout the building, as well as support classroom teachers with resources and materials. This is an exciting service project that encourages movement and nutrition. UNICEF KidPower is a learning opportunity which incorporates standards-aligned lessons and activities with a wearable fitness tracker, and the UNICEF organization provides nutrition to needy children around the world. My students will wear the UNICEF KidPower wrist bands which track how much they move and that is transformed into lifesaving nutrition that UNICEF delivers to malnourished communities. The more my students run, skip, hop, jump, or walk, the more they will learn about global missions. Students will go on virtual discoveries where they will learn about different cultures and UNICEF's work. Through these tasks, the kids will earn points. The more points the students earn, the more life-saving packets of food are delivered to kids in need around the world. We will also learn about the different cultures of these children as well as the benefits of movement and nutrition.",My students need Unicef Kid Power bands to encourage and track their physical activity while also providing them with opportunities to learn about and participate in global service learning.,"Applied Learning, Health & Sports",Grades 3-5,Sports & Exercise Equipment,990.59,Fully Funded

Although my students have had limited experiences in the area of science, they are eager to learn. They learn best when I can provide them with real life experiences. My goal this year is to set up these experiences with instructional rigor so my students can think at higher levels to solve problems using the scientific process. This field trip project will cover the cost of the Outdoor Classroom, which will enable our 5th grade students to experience science in a real world natural wild life setting. Our students will participate in specific teacher/camp naturalist planned activities and projects (ie. food chain, nature hike, survival engineering). They will investigate using the scientific process, and record data using a student journal provided by the camp. Being a high poverty school, our students require hands-on experiences to learn concepts, and this field trip will allow them to learn in a realistic engaging environment.

There are two classrooms per grade level. My kindergartners are fortunate to have access to a beautiful school library, a rich and diverse classroom library and some tablets in the classroom to listen to stories. Dr. Seuss said, 'The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” In their short time in 5K, they have learned that books allow them to to discover things they never knew and to experience amazing adventures.

I know that all of my students will be thrilled to take these new little reader books home to read to their family.
