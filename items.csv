This is especially true for the PK-4 students I serve in the school library. Currently, their only option for reading is the floor or one old bean bag that they vie for. The students I serve are friendly and motivated to learn. They attend a low-income school in Illinois and many of them come from homes where English is their second language. Often my students only access to books is in the school library. They work hard to learn each day, and deserve a comfortable and inviting library. In order to create a comfortable reading environment for my students I am asking for beanbag chairs, reading pillow seats, and a rocking chair that all of my students can use when they curl up on the floor to read. These new seating options will give my students the opportunity to spread out in the library during reading time and still be comfortable. By being more comfortable, they will also be more engaged in their reading and be more motivated to curl up and enjoy a good book. I cannot wait for the day when my students are excited to come to the library to spend their extra time reading. With your help, I will be able to provide them with the library of their dreams!

I am requesting approximately 50 books from popular series like Fly Guy, Henry and Mudge, and Elephant and Piggie. I have also asked for classic fairy tales and nonfiction books students can use during our science units. Each week my students look forward to going 'book shopping' in our classroom library. They are allowed to take 10 books at a time to keep in their bag of books for reading time. With 26 students in my class this year, that means I need at least 260 books each week to keep my students excited and engaged in reading.

Or perhaps, wanted to show something enhanced right away? As a teacher, this is our life- to share! Both my eighth graders and myself are eager to share everything we learn and know with our class. A document camera will enable us to do so. I teach in a Title One, diverse, multi-cultural school. With over 29 languages represented on our campus, we need all the tools we can use to communicate with our students. My eighth graders love math and technology, and luckily math is a universal language. Our school is in a low socioeconomic neighborhood but full of eager, creative learners. In our district, our goal is to have all children excelling and to be college and career ready. We follow the common core standards to ensure that all students are getting the same quality education. My students get so excited when we are able to experience new learning through our smart boards, graphing calculators, laptop carts, and responders; however, we have needs that a document camera would fulfill. With the document camera, my students will have greater opportunities to share their work and discoveries, and learn in a more dynamic way! This will lead to greater listening and work skills. With this, they can share in a positive, encouraging manner. They will be able to use and display math manipulatives under the camera to explain thinking, as well as share their work and steps. Our school is big on STEM teaching in our classrooms, which allows more investigative exploration of topics. As a teacher, I would be able to model more efficiently to the class as a whole. This will also save A LOT of time, for documents not available for the smart board to view, will be able to be shown and not needed to be copied onto a whiteboard. Picture your child in a classroom with a document camera, would you not feel more confident in the learning taking place verses not having a document camera? They truly do help speed up the learning process, while making the learning more engaging and fun! Technology is the future! This will give our students another opportunity to be challenged and to express their ideas and thinking in a different, functional way. It is a more efficient way for me to model, to demonstrate, to display my graphing calculator to teach steps, and to show each other'ÂÂs work, which will enhance learning and knowledge of the world around us. Teaching is my passion and with the use of a document camera, I will be an even more effective educator for our future!Other's ","My students need a document camera in order to engage their learning, save time, and view virtually anything within moments.","Applied Learning, Math & Science",Grades 6-8,Technology,539.47,Fully Funded

My students struggle with our language, and when they can't see what trick or change I made on a worksheet, it is hard for them, or when someone solved a problem and it can't be seen. My students are from all over the world. Some are just learning the English Language and this is their first classroom in America. Other students have been here or were born here. Our school is striving to achieve excellence in a low socioeconomic part of our state. We encourage and create lifelong learners and instill go ethics into our students. This way they do go on to further their education. Our school itself is on a 98% free and reduced lunch program to help the struggling parents. We don't have the funding for document cameras and other things that will help our children be prepared for the world. The teachers usually provide most of the school supplies and other basic needs for the children. Having a document camera will help my students inspire and learn from one another. It will help them see clearly where we are on a worksheet no matter where they sit in the room. An example of an activity is when we use factors in a Venn diagram to find the greatest common factor. Students can come up and place their document under the camera and explain how and why they got the answer they did. If they are incorrect it allows the other students to encourage a different answer. The students can now see each other's evidence and reasoning. This request is very important to me because even though my students are from a low socioeconomic area I want them to have the tools and skills any other child would. This way they can thrive in the environment and not continue to repeat a cycle of poverty. My students will have a chance to learn from each other and have clarity when doing a worksheet.

Being a visual learner myself, I understand the need for my class to have that same experience. Children need to SEE what they are learning to develop and challenge their minds. My classroom is currently full of 34 second grade students who are all eager to learn and come from very diverse and difficult backgrounds. I teach in a high poverty neighborhood in Arizona, where most of the population in our school are English Language Learners. Our kids have a strong desire to learn and challenge themselves, despite the hard challenges they face at home. They are extremely hard workers and push themselves to 'Achieve the American Dream'. As a child and an adult, I have always been a very visual learner. I need to see it to understand it, and experience it to remember it. My second grade students are the exact same way and I would love to give them ALL the opportunity to fall in love with learning through the use of a document camera. Since I have a large class this year, 34 students, it is difficult to model and teach in the way they need it without them seeing it first hand. By using a document camera, I can not only bring more technology into the classroom, but I can enhance their learning experience. Showing them other students work using the camera, or modeling lessons and independent practice that they can all visually see will be so much more rewarding to them as a learner. I also would love for my students to be able to teach their classmates using this technology tool. I can only see positive learning and success coming from the use of a document camera in my classroom! I honestly believe that a document camera could make a huge difference in my students' behavior and learning. Technology is so widely used within our world now, it is so important to bring it into the classroom as well!

My school is located in an area where most of the families do not have much money, and often barely have enough money to cover their basic needs. My school is a choice school in our district so parents from any part of the district can choose to send their students to our school. The families here want only the best for their child and work hard to help their children to succeed in school even if they have limited time, money or even English speaking skills at home. The listening center will be allow small groups of students to listen to a story and follow along with the reader in their book. After the story they will be able listen to questions and check their comprehension of the stories even if they are still working on becoming independent readers. Having this listening center will allow one more center in my classroom so I can have smaller groups to work with and give students more personalized help during their time working with me each day.

My ELL students, who struggle with reading, need to feel successful as readers. It's a challenge to find the right books for them. Graphic novels are the perfect fit for them because the pictures help them understand. My students are English Language leaners who come from low-income homes. Many of them do not have access to books in their homes. The majority of students in my classroom are reading below grade level. Most of their parents speak only Spanish, so it is hard for them to get support and help with reading at home. This year they have come so far as readers. Every day we work to instill a love for books and reading. Through booktalks and read alouds my students are getting more and more excited about reading. My students read independently every day. They are able to choose their own books, and most of my students gravitate towards graphic novels. These books engage them because the picture support helps them with their comprehension. Graphic novels are especially helpful for my reluctant boys readers. They can't get enough of graphic novels. I love watching these boys read graphic novels because they are finally able to feel successful as readers. We need these books in our classroom so that my students' love of reading can continue to grow. This donation will enable me to keep putting great books into the hands of my students.

My class is filled with bright students from diverse backgrounds, most of whom will be learning English as a second language. My students are future engineers, teachers, and politicians, and we are working hard in first grade to prepare them for college, career, and citizenship. We love writing and work hard to write creative, well-crafted pieces in many different genres. We also use writing to learn more about reading, science, and art. Writing, writing, and more writing is the best way to become a better writer. In first grade, we spend over 150 minutes a week writing. We write stories, letters, personal narratives, informational pieces, opinions, poems, and more. The most basic materials we need are pretty simple: pencils and paper. We have pencils and paper already, but to keep our writing workshop running smoothly, we need a high quality pencil sharpener to help keep our pencils sharp and ready to write. In addition to the basics, we need staplers and tape to revise and edit our writing, high quality children's books to motivate and inspire us to write more and more, and boxes to store books in.

These kids are like my family and our room is full of kindness and love. These children live in a rural area and are part of working families doing the best they can. They are sweet, caring, kind and lovable!!! They try their best everyday and are very creative. They love to learn and come to school. Children need to have and make choices! Having this new carpet will give them better seating options and the freedom to be the learner they want and need to be. By allowing them to choose where the learning best suits them and having the control to make their own decisions, they can take charge of their own learning. Our carpet will provide comfort, space and will be able to be used as a learning tool where the children can use the letters for recognition and sound sorting centers. Your generous donation to our project will improve our Kindergarten classroom by building stronger readers and writers. This will change our students' lives for the better. They will love school and feel success at an early age --- having fun while learning!","My students need a new, unstained rug for flexible seating.

I do everything on my computer, and my students need to start learning to navigate them in safe and meaningful settings. Students are expected to be proficient with computer use, but don't have access to enough quality technology at home, or in the classroom. Authentic and integrated experiences with technology are only possible if we have access to it. Students will use these Chromebooks to improve math fluency, read relevant nonfiction articles, publish their writing, create art, write code, and more.

Thes girls have the heart and determination to be better than they were yesterday. These girls are full of energy on the field and are full of life. Most of the students at our school come from low-income households that are not able to afford all the equipment their child will need to play a sport. Being a middle school team we do not have all of the equipment we need. We are always underfunded and always get high schools equipment when they get new equipment. With this being said I would like to provide my players with new equipment for how hard they work on a daily basis. My softball players will use these helmets every day to protect them. This donation would help my players that are worried if they are going to be able to afford to get the correct equipment they need for the season. These items will ensure the player's safety at games and at practice. This donation will help us start up a successful middle school softball program. This will help my girls know that there are people out there that will support them and help them. This generosity will show a reward on how hard they are working.

My students are very observant and they enjoy interacting with the world around them. In our classroom, we never sit still! I am always trying to get my students up and moving around, singing, or exploring in small groups to make learning engaging. They learn best when they are having fun. I work very hard to provide my students with meaningful experiences on a daily basis. Our books are EVERYWHERE! Book bags are ripping and book bins are falling apart. My students are passionate about reading and have so many different interests! Because of their enthusiasm I've added tons of new books to our classroom library, but we don't have enough bins for all our books, and our old bins are so full they are cracking! We currently store their guided reading books and library books in plastic Ziploc bags. These bags do not hold up very well in the hands of busy six year olds. They are always ripping to shreds and books are getting lost. I want to help my students keep our classroom library organized so they can spend their time reading and not struggling to find their favorite book.","My students need new book bins and bags to replace our old broken ones, and to fit and organize all of the amazing new fiction and non-fiction books we have added to our library.",Literacy & Language,Grades PreK-2,Books,382.46,Fully Funded
9011a9aec0f7d216f07613d6496ca1e9,Adapting To Changes,"I have a typical seventh grade class. My students are from a variety of socioeconomic and racial backgrounds. Many of my students' parents are in the military. The skill level varies from extremely high to extremely low. I have an average of twenty-five students in each of my five classes. Most are highly motivated learners and are very interested in science. They love technology and embrace its integration in the classroom. Fostering a love of learning and training lifetime learners is the main goal in my class. They are our future leaders. This year there have been many changes in my classroom. Our science benchmarks have changed and the class use of technology has increased. We have a greater focus on physical science in the state standards, so my students need chemistry kits to create models to achieve a deeper understanding of these standards. We have become a Google classroom and we use the technology to the best of our ability. The addition of an iPad will allow my students to video and research when they need it, instead of just when we are scheduled to have the media cart. Students often struggle understanding the concept of molecular makeup and atomic structure. If students are able to build models of these difficult concepts they will gain a better understanding of these benchmarks. The chemistry kits will allow a hands-on approach that will greatly benefit kinesthetic learners and visual learners alike. Students learn by doing and these kits allow students to create molecular structures and atomic models. The added use of these kits has the ability to create a great cornerstone middle school and high school chemistry. Every year my students create science videos of the benchmarks they learn in seventh grade. The students will be able to use the iPad for these videos and they can video other science demonstrations. Students will be able to peer teach each other by videoing demonstrations and science labs. Students will also help out their classmates by videoing important classroom lessons for future reference. All of these videos can be added to our Google classroom to be used as learning aids. The added technology will also be used for research in the classroom. Students will be able to have a reference aid right at their fingertips for research on science topics we cover throughout the year.","My students need concrete examples of abstract science concepts such as atomic and molecular models, plus an iPad and case to aid in research and video.",Math & Science,Grades 6-8,Computers & Tablets,765.99,Fully Funded

I wouldn't expect an engineer to sit in a too-small-for-them desk for 6 hours a day doing hard work, and I don't expect it from my students either! While my fourth graders are hard at work they move flexibly from their desks to the floor, and having additional tools to make them more comfortable would be very beneficial.
