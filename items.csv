7685f0265a19d7b52a470ee4bac883ba,Stand Up to Bullying: Together We Can!,"Did you know that 1-7 students in grades K-12 is either a bully or a victim of bullying? My goal is to raise prevention through being educated and aware of the effects and consequences of bullying. They need to know how to access a science-base, research-validated curriculum via Internet and books. We are part of a small pre-k and kindergarten primary center. Our student population is less than 300 students. My students are learning to stand up to bullying. They are great kids discovering the world and learning to read and write. But I worry that next year when they leave our primary center and attend their neighborhood school (student population over 500) they will face a very different environment. I hope that the lessons that they have learned about friendships, kindness, and working cooperatively will reduce any instances of bullying. I want to raise awareness and educate my students so they can ask for help when they needed. Vigilance and discipline is the key! We know that knowledge is power; I want my students to know how to access information that will help them stand up to bullying. My project is to work with them in group discussions using their book, 'Bullying in Schools' as they will all have a copy to keep and share with their parents. I will use the tablet with a small group of four kids at a time. Together we will navigate web sites to watch videos and testimonials. They can then talk about it, share with their parents, and I can lead class discussions. There is access to information, articles and poems, and making them aware will educate them further on bullying. We must rise up and be the change to reach bullying in the heart of the problem. Bullying takes many forms and can happen in many contexts. Bullying is complex and there is no one size fits all solution for it, but knowledge is power. My students need to know how to find answers and information when they need it. This problem of bullying in schools is not one without a solution. We need every one helping teachers, parents, administrators and people in our community. The facts show that it is estimated that 160,000 children miss school every day due to fear of attack or intimidation by other students. Being aware of these facts should raise awareness and support. Your efforts will certainly have an impact. Together we can stand up to bullying. ","My students need 25 copies of 'Bullying in Schools' for each to keep, 'Stand Up For Yourself and Your Friends: Dealing With Bullies', 'A Smart Kid's Guide to Online Bullying' and a tablet to research specific websites that talk about prevention strategies on bullying.",Applied Learning,Grades PreK-2,Technology,361.8,Fully Funded
c6527e2b0e6721a201ce38300c89d117,Bonkers Over Books,"Dr. Seuss wrote,'The more you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.' How true that is! My students are just beginning that incredible journey into reading. I teach a large group of very excited 5 year olds who love to come to school and learn new things. They love to learn about and experience new things. They come from a low-income, rural area of South Carolina, but are very eager to learn new things. They attend a large elementary school which houses pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. Reading is a fundamental skill that is necessary for all subjects. As a kindergarten teacher my responsibility for laying that foundation for good reading skills is paramount. These books would not only help my kids learn to be better readers, but I think it would also help instill in them a passion for reading. They will begin to understand that reading can be fun as well! By donating to this project, you will help my students become better readers and prepare them to be better students and learners throughout their lives. They will have the opportunity to do better in school because they will have achieved success with reading early in their school careers.

47b8692b9ddb853be4e937ba5634d3cc,Help Us Work Together to End Bullying!,"Like many before us, children become leaders and problem-solvers by interacting meaningfully and safely with others. We need to learn how our actions affect each other, and encourage positive behaviors. Help me create a bully-free school where students thrive and grow into the leaders we will need! My students are a great group of children who live in a low-income, urban setting in southern California. Many come from hard-working, struggling families. My students' success is largely due to my use of proven teaching techniques that are effective for all learners, but especially English language learners which make up more than half of our population of students. The other huge factor in their success is their motivation, and understanding that their learning is tied to life outside the classroom: past, present, and most importantly, future! My classroom is structured on the belief that all students deserve a quality education and can achieve. Currently, my school is tackling the issue of bullying, and we are striving to create a community of learners who can interact meaningfully and easily together, rather than isolating each other. We just need support getting the materials we need to make learning engaging and effective for all students. Bullying is a real problem in today's schools. We need resources to engage students in serious conversations about bullying and tolerance. The best way to practice this after learning is to have the children working TOGETHER. For this reason, I am asking for small group and partner sets of carefully selected titles. The books will be read to the whole class and used in small group settings to address current issues, or prevent events before they occur. We will highlight issues that affect kids everyday, discuss the causes and effects of bullying, and empower students to act in those situations. Students will be able to apply their knowledge of bullying to famous leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr and George Washington, who stood up to bullying at racial and government levels. They will discuss and present about themes of kindness, inclusion, and personal responsibility towards others and the environment. Books about diagrams and charts will help them create collaborative posters. Each day, bullying is a more serious issue than the day before. Learning to work together on projects is an especially important opportunity as more isolated activities such as video games are a popular pastime for kids. These bullying resources are crucial to the positive experience of the students at our school. The skills and strengths that they develop now will stay with them as they go on to middle and high school. Thank you for your support of our school, education, and anti-bullying.

493c00b498844411aa4e7ce72cc6ca9a,There's Only One of Me!,"Do you remember what it felt like when you had your teacher's sole attention and it felt like you were the only child in the room? You needed some clarification or wanted a story read to you and your teacher was there. My goal is to be that teacher for my students, but sadly there's only one of me! I teach a group of energetic children who are eager to learn and who thrive on one-on-one attention. Our school is a very challenging, yet rewarding place to teach. Over 80% of our students qualify for free and reduced lunch, an indicator of poverty and high needs. Our children come to school with a very wide range of abilities and experiences. The struggles my students face daily sometimes can present obstacles in their quest to learn at the highest possible levels. I want to use every resource I can to level the 'playing field.' In other words, it is my mission to provide them with experiences and tools that will help them experience the most success possible. Independence is a key to success, but it is not always an easy skill for children to master. This is where small 'crutches' can help to bridge the gap towards independence. The AnyBook Reader would be one of these small 'crutches' that could aide in building independent learners as it presents a wealth of possibilities within the classroom. I teach in such a way that a large part of my day is spent with small groups or individual students. This means that the rest of my students must be actively engaged in meaningful activities. The AnyBook Reader with headphones could be used to provide directions to the myriad activities with which the students are engaged. Fluency could also be developed as the students listen to books that I read aloud or they could record their own voices as they read books aloud. ELL and Special Needs Students could benefit from the recording of visual schedules and the further explanation of concepts recorded just for them. The possibilities are endless! My students deserve the best educational experience possible. You have the opportunity to help me provide my students with a learning environment that meets their individual needs and will help them achieve at the highest level possible. When students have, within their reach, materials at their individual levels, it is as if a world of possibilities has been placed before them.

159b18c49967d8a4f290fc9f2cb227ab,Hearing is Believing!,"British accents, stand-up comedy, biographies of notable historical figures are just a few of the wonderful experiences that have come to life for my students in their listening center. My fifth graders are extremely hardworking and eager to learn, but they have trouble seeing the important role they will play in the future. They are becoming better readers and writers every day, but sometimes they are unable to make the connection between their education and real-life experience. Many of them are first generation Americans and only speak/hear English in school. They enjoy music and listening to stories. They are students that have all the potential to go much farther in life. Our charter school serves a hardworking low income urban community in New Jersey. We are a school that serves not only our students but we aim to include the 'community,' which includes parents and local community leaders. We all come together to promote education and educational experiences! These headphones for our listening center will help my students by being able to listen to great literature by great authors and biographical and historical stories about individuals and events that made an impact in our lives. I am a strong believer in small group instruction and literacy centers. While I sit with my small group or conduct one-on-one reading conferences, students need to be in meaningful engaging activities as to become independent and insightful readers. One of the literacy stations was a listening center where students listened to chapter books and then held meaningful discussions. The headphones stopped working recently and we have had to stop the center. My students have been learning how to read with passion and life, not just the sound of letters. These students need to be prepared to speak in public or interview. Listening to these stories was a stepping stone to their future. Until recently my fifth graders looked forward to hearing a story read to them. Children love being read to! My students need to experience all types of literacy engagement to help them understand the difference between saying words and being an effective speaker to all audiences. Whether informing, persuading or entertaining, proper articulation is key to becoming successful in any career path my students may choose for themselves.

306a2ff1267088fa311000da4e081207,Pop Bead genetics,"Science is like another language to most people and it is often difficult to teach concepts that students cannot visualize. These DNA models help overcome that obstacle. I work at a high needs school in an inner city in Missouri. Our school caters to children whose families are seeking asylum from religious or political persecution in their homeland. I work primarily with English Language Learners and the use of visuals are imperative to teaching them not only science, but English as well. DNA is a type of macromolecule known as a nucleic acid. It is shaped like a twisted double helix and is composed of long strands of alternating sugars and phosphate groups, as well as nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine). DNA controls cellular activity by coding for the production of enzymes and proteins. The information in DNA is not directly converted into proteins, but must first be copied into RNA in a process called transcription. These models allow students to break down complex processes into steps as well as engage the learners through a hands-on approach to science education. Constructing DNA models is a great way to learn about DNA structure, function, and replication. DNA models are representations of the structure of DNA.

Do you remember the one you kept reading even though you were super tired and had so many other things to do? That's how great the Texas Bluebonnet Books are! These books get kids excited about reading! The most wonderful part of being a teacher is opening the children's eyes to the world of books. It is amazing that, in this age of technology, this is still possible! My students are choosing books over television or video games, and all because books are close at hand: in our classroom library. Our school is very diverse, with half the population from middle class families, while the other half are economically disadvantaged. Our school is also a bilingual campus, providing a dual language education for over 160 bilingual students. We have many wonderful programs at our school, such as C2 (C squared) which stands for a Culture of Caring. Students work together to ensure a positive, caring environment by practicing and recognizing acts of kindness. We also send backpacks of food home every weekend with students who do not have enough to eat. We strive to take care of each other. I am requesting one copy of each of the 20 Texas Bluebonnet Award Books for 2013-2014 for our classroom. These books are chosen by librarians across Texas as quality literature to enrich student growth and learning. The books range in genre and reading levels. There are fiction, non-fiction, mysteries, biographies, fantasy, picture books, poetry, and chapter books! It is an amazing list of books that kids from kinder to 6th grade can read and enjoy. Through the Texas Bluebonnet Book program, children are encouraged to read all 20 books on the list, but if they read at least 5, they may vote for their favorite. The votes are tallied state-wide and it is the children who choose the best of all 20. This is such a wonderful way to encourage children to read! Having these amazing books close at hand allows my students to be involved in this program! Many of my students will read all 20, and then may compete in a friendly district competition called the Battle of the Bluebonnets. My students need these 20 amazing Texas Bluebonnet Books for our classroom so that they may have them available to read and share with each other.

This causes them to become cramped in our small classroom and creates a difficult environment in which to work cooperatively. They struggle to stay organized and have difficulty moving around the classroom with ease. By creating a classroom with a clear and roomy set up, my students will have a design that enables them to move around with ease and sets the stage for a cooperative learning environment that allows them to work together. By integrating a teamwork mentality in my students, they not only build positive and effective working relationships, but also gives them the opportunity to strengthen our classroom family and see their own personal strengths as they become peer mentors. First graders are very busy!! By allowing them to sit together in small groups, they are given the opportunity to work cooperatively and effectively in order to build relationships and offer them the chance to become coaches and realize their individual strengths.

I teach in a self contained second grade class of seven and eight year old students. We live in a rural community with the population of 2,000. Our school has Kindergarten through second grade. Our second grade has seven classes. The diversity in my classroom comes from having several ESL students and numerous learning levels. My students will use the iPad as a form of technology to research and do different activities to gain the knowledge of economic vocabulary and see the vocabulary come to life through real life experiences. Students will be taught to use different apps to gain information on different countries and their markets. Students will gain the awareness of how economics is in everything we do and that every decision has a cost. Students will work in groups to collaborate during their research. Your donation will make a difference in my class by providing my students with iPads to use to research the world around them. This will help engage my students in skills that will prepare them to be successful and productive citizens.

Three calculators available for students to check out to complete their homework and prepare for the SAT will help out immeasurably! My students are some of the hardest working in San Diego. They have aspirations to attend college and higher level math classes will help them achieve this goal. Please help my students get calculators to use in their math classes. In our school, our students are: 40% immigrants and refugees, 63% English language learners, 100% eligible for free and reduced lunch, 100% hardworking, resilient, and diligent. The students are in one of the most diverse areas of the United States. Students come from Africa, Vietnam, Mexico, Burma, and many other countries. The students stand proud as new Americans and value the opportunity to get an education. Many of these students will be first in their family to attend college, the first to graduate high school, and they are taking Calculus! 120 students are prepared to take Calculus this year. Many of my students have had very little experience using technology, let alone graphing calculators. Imagine being confused in your math class, the teacher describes how it works, but you just can't imagine. Then you punch a few buttons on the calculator and, voila, everything makes sense. Calculators are essential for success in Calculus. Additionally, students will be gaining skills using the graphing calculators that will be important for success when taking the SAT. Calculus is impossible to understand without calculators. Access to this basic technology will dramatically improve success for these young people. Your support will create a new pathway for success for our students. A calculator can make a huge difference in learning.
