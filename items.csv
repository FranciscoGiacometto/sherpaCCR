I encourage my students to find those books that stimulate and create a desire to read daily. Let's give them the resources that continue to draw my dragons in and keep the fire for reading alive! The imagination of my students and the information they share about the books they read, drive me to give them rich and equitable resources to engage them in reading. Their eyes light up with excitement when they are taught about specific authors, genres, readers theaters and are able to debate current issues and topics through reading. My students come from diverse backgrounds and most do not have a libraries at home. I often allow them to take books from our classroom library to ensure they are carrying the love of reading home. My adorable dragons continue to excel and grow through reading. This is only one way I can continue to help them thrive and grow. I cannot even begin to express what 'Storyworks' will allow me to integrate in the classroom, or the benefits it will bestow upon my students, but I will give it my best shot. As we have rolled out Common Core Standards, it has been challenging to find resources and text to support our lessons. As I stumbled upon a copy of 'Storyworks,' it has enhanced my teaching significantly. I am able to teach complex text in a wide range of genres, share thrilling narrative non-fiction text, original fiction, bring historical events to life through readers theater, explore classic and contemporary poetry, as well as support each one of my students at their individual levels. The best part of 'Storyworks' is I am able to allow my students to take them home and share them with their family and loved ones. This request is not only for my own personal classroom but that of my grade level. I desire to let my passion for reading to infiltrate as many as you will allow.

4c9856860bcb74b7b3b46cf3dce80974,Reading All Stars,"'Yes! I just read this book by myself!' My first graders feel so proud when they have read a book independently. They need a way to organize their books to help them become independent readers by the end of the year. My class of six-year old and seven-year old students live in a close-knit, low-income neighborhood. Many of their parents also attended our school. They love to learn but many face hardships at home; including parents who are incarcerated, one parent homes, and parents who fight often in front of them. Many of my students come to school to escape difficulties at home. School is their bridge to success. I see myself not only as a teacher of content but a role model for what one can achieve through hard work and perseverance. I try to open their minds to what awaits them in the world and what possibilities their futures can hold. Learning to read can be a daunting task. Students need many experiences with reading books and other materials. These durable book holders will allow my students a special place to keep the books they are reading. Now, their books often get pushed into their desks, sometimes damaging the book, or fall out onto the floor. My students love to read so they try to hold onto several books at once. These book holders will allow them to more easily see the books they have chosen and which ones they want to return to our classroom library. They can carry the book holders with them when looking for a cozy place to read. These durable book holders will benefit my current students, as well as all of my future students. Learning to read is our mission. I want to provide them with many opportunities to acquire these important skills. Being strategic and independent readers will enhance my students' futures and allow them to be successful in any field.

My students need practice with the minute in order to access the magnificent. My students are wonderful second graders who are eager to learn. They come from a wide variety of racial and language backgrounds and almost fifty percent of them qualify for free or reduced lunch. Some have access to computers at home but many are only exposed to technology at school. We started a wonderful new math program last year and are continuing to focus on mathematical reasoning as a school this year. The students are excited about math and are beginning to see themselves as mathematicians. Practice makes all of the difference in solidifying new math skills. Unfortunately many components of essential practice can seem boring to young children. I will use these iPads as part of a math facts practice center to supplement our current math program. This technology will help kids want to practice critical math facts through the use of many terrific apps like 'Math Motion.' Learning to add and subtract quickly and accurately has never been so much fun! As a teacher I can customize flashcards in a game format for each child and keep track of his or her proficiency. Another wonderful benefit of this technology is the ability to differentiate so it helps kids who need extra time learning facts as well as kids who are ready for more challenges. The kids actually enjoy practicing because it seems like a game! Motivation is a critical component of learning. These iPads are highly prized by the students and they will be eager to spend time practicing their math facts when they have access to this technology. Facility with addition, subtraction, and multiplication facts is one of the foundations of later success in math and these iPads will especially help kids who don't get additional practice at home.

My goal? For kids to discover the magic of reading so they want to read more. Emerson Elementary is a thriving urban public school in Berkeley, CA. Our students come from a wide range of backgrounds, ethnically, racially and economically. What makes our school thrive? Our teachers are committed to reaching all students, creating a positive, supportive, engaged learning environment. Our relatively small size (300 students) means that as the librarian, I know each and every one of our kids. All of our students come to the library once each week to check out books, and I work with them to help them find books they are interested in and are at their reading level. But like so many schools, we struggle with funding and providing materials that engage such a wide variety of students. I am especially concerned about finding new ways to get kids excited about reading when they are reading significantly below grade level. This grant will enable our school library to start a Kindle pilot program, purchasing 10 Kindle e-readers. These will be available for all 4th and 5th graders to use, but we will focus on reaching kids who have been identified as needing extra support with reading. I will help students find e-books to check out from the local library, thus using our limited resources to stretch what we can offer our students. Students will be able to read at their level, without any social stigma of having a book that looks uncool or too young. The Kindle provides support for struggling readers in many ways, notably an integrated dictionary, text-to-voice read aloud feature for unknown words, and adjustable font size. Initial research in the field also indicates that the 'cool' factor of reading with new technology can increase students' motivation, especially when supported by a librarian who can help them find just right books to read. As the school librarian, I often see myself as a cheerleader for reading. But I know many of my students struggle with reading and hate checking out books at their level-- especially if that means books that seem too short, too young, and definitely not cool. My goal is to help all kids find books that make them want to read. Ian, who loves graphic novels but doesn't always sink into a novel, said, 'I like the feel of reading on the Kindle. It makes me want to read more.' Hooray!! ","My students need 10 Kindles, covers, and adapters to support and engage reluctant readers.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Technology,1831.56,Expired

Incorporating technology through tablets allows the world to be readily available and will deepen our students thinking while learning. My students are wonderful second graders who are eager to learn. They come from a wide variety of racial and language backgrounds and almost fifty percent of them qualify for free or reduced lunch. Some have access to computers at home but many are only exposed to technology at school. Some travel to Europe for a long weekend and some do not know where their next meal is coming from. The disparity is vast in Berkeley and the classroom is the bridge for all students. This year we have fully implemented Common Core State Standards. We are in need of technology within our rooms that easily used and accessible to young children. My goal is for our students to be able to use ipads to support evidence based thinking through technology that is user friendly. Ipads allow for young children to research topics of interest and access any skill work they may need through apps and web sites. My students are excited about learning and are always looking for more ways to expand their knowledge. In the classroom we often need to practice math facts, a way to research topics, and often have a need to answer questions immediately so we can then think deeply about the world around us. If my students could easily access the world through technology, it would increase their general knowledge about the world they live in. Our students would have extra opportunities for use of educational websites. My overall goal would be to have the students rotate on to the ipads as one of their daily learning centers. If a student needs additional help with math, but excels in language arts, there will be apps that allow for that student to practice math facts. Ipads also provide opportunities for students to explore science, writing and social studies with sites like Mobymax.com. This site individualizes content areas for students so they can expand the individual learning in any area they choose. It also provides the teacher with immediate feedback on each student's progress. Motivation is a critical component of learning. These ipads are highly prized items by my students. This technology will make them eager to practice their math facts, research topics, or answer questions they have while reading. Facility with math facts, the ability to do research on any topic are some of the foundations of successful scholars. These ipads will especially help kids who don't have these opportunities at home.

89b9eeb29b4826444adf8838d3f3d124,Computer Engineers of Tomorrow: A Coding Station,"William Butler Yeats wrote, 'Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.' Nowhere is this more apparent than when young children are absorbed in a game that is actually teaching them the basics of computer coding. My students are bright and eager third graders that reflect the rich diversity of our community. We are a wonderful mix of racial backgrounds, home languages, and ethnic backgrounds. Approximately forty percent of our students receive free or reduced lunches. Although some of my students have access to computers at home, many do not. They are all eager but, even at third grade, it is easy to see the beginning of a developing digital divide. This iPad and keyboard will make it possible to set up a coding station in my classroom. The kids will be able to use applications that disguise the logic and skills of coding as familiar games. These games are highly motivating and teach students the basics of computer programming while fostering perseverance and problem solving. Since the interface with the iPad is so intuitive, students with very little computer experience will still be able to access the applications and develop coding and basic computing skills. Having an iPad with a keyboard to use as coding station in class will give all students equal opportunity to explore the critical beginning skills of computer programming. It will also help give all of my students familiarity and confidence with computing. Although we are a small school, we strive to provide enrichment and those special experiences that make students want to come to school and learn. This coding station is a high interest, highly educational activity that will make students eager to persevere and learn skills that will serve them well into adulthood. It will also begin to bridge the digital divide that is already beginning to develop.

18ad63856fee034bc5acc88868f7cd53,Chromebooks for Bright Students,"My students are excited every time they get to use technology in class. Last year, my 5th graders used Chromebooks across all disciplines, but we had to share a tech cart with multiple classrooms. I want to expand my students' ability to do this kind of work this year but we need more Chromebooks. Our school is a microcosm of our community; our diversity spans culture, heritage, and socioeconomic status. Half of my students qualify for free and reduced lunch, which means their families are living below the poverty line. Our district continues to invest in technology opportunities and now all students have Google accounts and we use Google docs to share our work. We have recently upgraded our broadband, and teachers an take technology-focused professional development. However, we still do not have enough computers in the classroom. Currently, shared Chromebook carts are stored in the library and have to be checked out by teachers and moved from class to class. This is not only a waste of time, it is also disruptive to the teachers and students. We want to improve the technology experience for our students in the most efficient way possible, and having enough Chromebooks is a simple, cost-effective solution. My students will use these Chromebooks for learning across many disciplines. Last year, using the shared Chromebook carts from the library, we did research, wrote poetry, created Google slide show book reports, and used Khan Academy and Arcademics to provide individualized math instruction. With more Chromebooks, we can reach more individual students and increase the amount of learning happening in our classroom. This DonorsChoose grant is part of our school's overall strategy to utilize a variety of funding sources to achieve our goal of a Chromebook on every student’s desk. We will use the Chromebooks to do research, create reports and projects, and work on individualized math activities. My students will also learn basic skills such as typing and navigating the internet, especially since several of my students do not have access to this at home. This project will make a difference in the following ways: Individualized Instruction: my students will have the opportunity to receive individual math problems to solve, e-books to read, and websites/topics to research using technology. Publishing for a Real-World Audience: my students need to see themselves as authors and creators who have valuable things to say to real audiences.

Many of the students love to read but aren’t challenged enough. This year a group of teachers decided to change this and brought Battle of the Books to our school. It was a huge success. If you don’t know what that is I’ll explain it for you. Battle of the Books is when the students read books from a list. The books on the list are of various difficulty but picked to challenge students. Teams are formed and they compete in a day of competition answering questions about the books they read. Eventually, it comes down to two teams and a final battle. After the final battle a winner is crowned! It is a fun and exciting event that we hope to continue for years to come. In order for us to continue the competition we need multiple copies of high interest but challenging books for our next competition. One of the awesome things about Battle of the Books is that students can read the books individually or teachers can read them with their class. The book and audiobook (so students can listen to the book and follow along) that I am requesting is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The students at my school love the Harry Potter series but many have not read the books but have seen the movies. We all know the movie version of a book is often very different from the book itself.

They are amazing kids and families that deserve the best! They work hard and have great attitudes! They need extra support physically and financially to help them be successful. One hundred percent of our students receive free breakfast and lunch. Their lack of resources does not stop their drive to learn. They are motivated kids that once they have the proper tools their success is endless. My 3rd grade classroom loves to read. They are at an age where their imaginations run wild and they can fall into a book and become a part of it within the first few pages. Reading takes them to new places and exposes them to different times and cultures. Our students come from a low poverty community and go without in many things in their lives. I would love to provide them with a classic award winning books that is coming out as a movie next year! 'A Wrinkle in Time', is a classic I remember reading when I was their age, and it will let their imagination run wild. Not only will this provide them with a wealth of knowledge, it will also help them become better writers and learn from other Authors. Reading is power and providing new titles means the world to them. These books will make a big difference for our classroom and will light up their passion to read. We will be using the items in collaborative centers during our Reader's workshop and Writer's workshop daily. Reading truly is a dream with open eyes. It allows our students to have experiences they may never have in their real lives. Please help us provide new resources for our classroom.

These kids are like my family and our room is full of kindness and love. These children live in a rural area and are part of working families doing the best they can. They are sweet, caring, kind and lovable!!! They try their best everyday and are very creative. They love to learn and come to school. Children need to have and make choices! Having this new carpet will give them better seating options and the freedom to be the learner they want and need to be. By allowing them to choose where the learning best suits them and having the control to make their own decisions, they can take charge of their own learning. Our carpet will provide comfort, space and will be able to be used as a learning tool where the children can use the letters for recognition and sound sorting centers. Your generous donation to our project will improve our Kindergarten classroom by building stronger readers and writers. This will change our students' lives for the better.

As with most public schools, we have limited resources to fund our library and this is an area where all students would benefit in our school. I am asking for these book sets to significantly increase the cultural representation of students in literature in 5 classroom libraries. The goal is to have five separate sets of books that can rotate between our classrooms throughout the year increasing the number of excellent books available and the number of students exposed to this rich text. We will purchase books based on excellence in content and story that represent marginalized groups as authors and illustrators as well as main characters in stories.

I am writing to you as a Special Education Teacher from a small rural school with a total school population of 138 students in grades K-4 through 5th grade. Of these students 70% receive free or reduced lunch. My students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and all have a vary diverse set of educational needs. What has been astounding to me as I continue to work with the students at my school is their willingness to read, and their spark for joining clubs and activities that involve reading here at school! When I started as the Special Education teacher this year I thought it may be fun to start a small book club to promote literacy school wide, what I did not anticipate was the amount of interest the Book Club would generated! The students who joined the Book Club have done so simply because they love to read, and I want to continue to help foster their love for reading and books!Unfortunately, to have a successful Book Club we need books! We need sets of books so that the students can partner and read in pairs. The students work diligently setting goals and reading!Reading is a transferable skill that is needed to make gains in all areas of life. Having students who are passionate about reading makes me, as an educator, excited to come to work each and everyday. Not having the funds to provide my students with the simplest resources needed, such as books, is difficult. By supplying students with books and encouraging them to continue to read, I hope that they will see that there are not limits when you truly put your mind to something. I hope to set an example for the students and encourage growth both in reading and socially!","My students need BOOKS, BOOKS, and more BOOKS!

Many students receive free or reduced-price lunch and students come from homes with limited opportunity for enrichment and exploration beyond the school walls. Beyond just a steady focus on helping students successfully meet mandated academic standards, I want to provide creative outlets for learning. Providing opportunities for growth in problem-solving skills, communication, and collaboration will help these students become successful adults. My position as a resource teacher allows me to work with a wide range of students throughout the building, as well as support classroom teachers with resources and materials. This is an exciting service project that encourages movement and nutrition. UNICEF KidPower is a learning opportunity which incorporates standards-aligned lessons and activities with a wearable fitness tracker, and the UNICEF organization provides nutrition to needy children around the world. My students will wear the UNICEF KidPower wrist bands which track how much they move and that is transformed into lifesaving nutrition that UNICEF delivers to malnourished communities. The more my students run, skip, hop, jump, or walk, the more they will learn about global missions. Students will go on virtual discoveries where they will learn about different cultures and UNICEF's work. Through these tasks, the kids will earn points. The more points the students earn, the more life-saving packets of food are delivered to kids in need around the world. We will also learn about the different cultures of these children as well as the benefits of movement and nutrition.",My students need Unicef Kid Power bands to encourage and track their physical activity while also providing them with opportunities to learn about and participate in global service learning.,"Applied Learning, Health & Sports",Grades 3-5,Sports & Exercise Equipment,990.59,Fully Funded

Although my students have had limited experiences in the area of science, they are eager to learn. They learn best when I can provide them with real life experiences. My goal this year is to set up these experiences with instructional rigor so my students can think at higher levels to solve problems using the scientific process. This field trip project will cover the cost of the Outdoor Classroom, which will enable our 5th grade students to experience science in a real world natural wild life setting. Our students will participate in specific teacher/camp naturalist planned activities and projects (ie. food chain, nature hike, survival engineering). They will investigate using the scientific process, and record data using a student journal provided by the camp. Being a high poverty school, our students require hands-on experiences to learn concepts, and this field trip will allow them to learn in a realistic engaging environment.

There are two classrooms per grade level. My kindergartners are fortunate to have access to a beautiful school library, a rich and diverse classroom library and some tablets in the classroom to listen to stories. Dr. Seuss said, 'The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” In their short time in 5K, they have learned that books allow them to to discover things they never knew and to experience amazing adventures. I am teaching my students to learn to read so that they can read to learn in the future. My goal is to have children fall in love with reading! Debra KostrewaRaymond School 5K TeacherHaving my students read their little reader books to their families every week is the cornerstone of our school’s homework program. I currently have to send home photocopied little readers with my students due to the lack of emergent reading level books in our school’s book room. The books I requested will replace the black and white photocopies. These books are beautifully illustrated, rich text and filled with sight words that my students can read. I know that all of my students will be thrilled to take these new little reader books home to read to their family. What better way to have students fall in love with reading than to have them read a story to their family members and take them on an adventure!
