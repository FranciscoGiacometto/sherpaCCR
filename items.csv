We don't have anywhere to sharpen our pencils! This is a small detail in a learning environment, but it makes a big difference to the way a student feels about others' investment in their learning. My students are part of one of the largest urban school districts in MA. There are 42 languages spoken in our school community. We struggle with many of the same issues all urban schools struggle with: full classrooms, tired teachers, not enough supplies, frustration at the lack of support, gang related violence, the many faces of poverty... But that is not what defines my students!!! My students are bright young individuals who deserve access a thriving educational environment that is rich in materials for learning. White board paddles can be used in so many ways in the classroom. I love giving students a chance to think and write their own answer before presenting it to the class. Additionally, this allows students who need a few extra seconds, or who speak English as a second language, a chance to write a response - allowing maximum inclusivity. I want to use the white board paddles, and markers to play games like jeopardy to help students review, and study. It will provide a great, fun interactive way for us to communicate as a class. The pencil sharpener would be such an added addition to our class. English class just doesn't work with out a place to sharpen our pencils so that we can begin to sharpen our writing skills. My students are quick witted, demanding, and have street intelligence that takes me by surprise. My students make me happy to enter the classroom everyday because they are starving for organized lessons and new information. I can get my students to produce amazing projects, papers, and presentations by inspiring them to move beyond the struggles they may face at home. I love interactive lessons that can help students get excited by learning.

I try to create an environment where students take pride in their classroom and design it to their artistic and individual personalities. In our classroom, students' own beautiful works of art decorate the walls. My students are bright, active, and sweet young learners. They are eager to learn whatever it is that I am willing to share. Although academics is a large part of the curriculum, I like to incorporate art and fun crafts to each lesson in order to keep the creativity alive in my classroom. I believe that it is just as important to keep students engaged with the arts - especially since budget cuts keep cutting costs in music, art, and physical education. I am currently a 1st grade teacher working in a Title One school in Los Angeles, Ca, where many students receive free or reduced lunch. My class also serves English Language Learners and a few students who receive extra support from the Resource Specialist for various needs. With a variety of abilities and disabilities in my classroom, it is important to provide my class with additional resources in order to meet the needs of all students and to keep them engaged in the curriculum. All of these materials will be used in the classroom and will benefit all of my students. With these materials, students will explore their individuality and create masterpieces in which they will be able to take home and treasure with family and friends. I truly enjoy incorporating art with academic lessons. By doing so, I am able to keep students engaged and students are able to explore their artistic and creative capabilities. With the beads, jewels, and gems, students can create beautiful works of art. Moreover, they can also practice creating patterns with numbers, size, color, and so much more. While working with these materials, students also practice developing their fine motor skills while they cut, arrange, and manipulate various objects with their tiny, little fingers and hands. With these materials, you would provide so much more than what you would think to these students. You are giving them art, education, creativity, individuality, fine motor skills, and so much more. The donations to this project will truly help my students gain a sense of individuality in our classroom of twenty-five first grade students. With these donations, they will be able to explore their creativity, their likes and dislikes, and they will be able to take ownership of their own education by being able to create their own works of art.

Last year 35 began in our kindergarten and this year we had 11 new students join the program. I often have students who finish early while others need individual attention. Mini-ipads would really help! We have kids from all over the world at our school. Here is where we all come together to learn as much as we can while simultaneously having as much fun as possible! Some of my students are better at math, others love science or sports but they all arrive excited and ready to learn every day. Everyone's learning has its own time-table. I have students who catch on like lightening while others who are just as enthusiastic need extra examples or some individual help. I have 11 who are new to the program this year so it would be very helpful to have mini-ipads available for the ones who finish early. They could visit webpages I have created for the class, play games in German or visit some of the many children's educational websites available in German while I work with small groups or individuals. Some of our families do not have Internet access at home so this would be a good opportunity for those students to experience using to internet to reinforce their learning. The amount of comprehensible input a learner processes is directly correlated to his/her level of success. In other words, the more German I can give them in meaningful and interesting ways, the better their proficiency will be. The ability to function in more than one language is certainly going to enrich their lives and widen their horizons at every turn.

When I look at the books we grew up with, I think of 'Fun with Dick and Jane.' We have come a long way! It's time to show the kids how fun reading can be.

My students will use these texts as an inspiration to explore their own race. They will first be able to read about others' experiences through their biographies, poetry, short stories and first-hand accounts. We will then have class discussions and write our own reflections about our own experiences both as they relate to the text and as they relate to our own roles in society. Text such as 'Letters to a Young Brother' can be used as open and honest inspiration as well as a starting point for discussions such as: why are these letters written? who they are written to? what do they hope to acheive?

I have the special opportunity as a kindergarten teacher to help create or sustain this kind of love of reading and I cherish every moment of it! My students are early readers that have shown such enthusiasm and eagerness in learning how to read. As the year has progressed, I have watched in awe as some students entered my classroom with a minimum knowledge of letters, and now they are beginning to read books independently. They are learning how to sound out words and use their knowledge of sight words to enter the early stages of reading. This time of the school year is always my favorite time of year! Now that my students are given the tools to begin reading, their love for literacy really skyrockets!I work at a Title I school with many students coming from socioeconomically disadvantaged households. Despite any challenges they may face at home, I can always count on seeing their bright and cheerful faces when they enter the classroom. We have truly established a warm, welcoming community that encourages others to try their best and to never give up. We also hold ourselves accountable to high expectations. I believe one of the most important tasks I have as an educator is to provide a wide variety of books for students to choose from in our listening center and classroom library to promote literacy. When students have choices in what books to read, they are more likely to become lifelong readers. The book selections that have been made will increase the variety of our classroom library. Donating to this project will provide students with literature as well as non-fiction selections that pique their personal interests.

I have a passion for urban education, and I participated in a cohort for urban scholars at Boston College where I earned my Masters in Secondary English Education.

This year we have gone hiking, snow shoeing, orienteering, and skiing. Teaching is my profession, but my students are my motivation and inspiration. I would like to take the course 'Writing for Children' so that I can explore the world in its' many plots. Stories for children, like stories for adults, come in many colors, from dark to light, and the best have in common archetypal characters, resonant plots, and concise, poetic language. The course I will take will use new and classic texts as inspiration, and we will try our hands writing in a variety of forms. This chance to write children's stories will serve as an inspiration and freeing spring board for me to explore writing in genres which will be used in my own classroom for creative writing and so much more for my own students. My students are yearning to move beyond the stifling essay and into the fanciful, and I am desirous to learn of ways to make this happen. I hope this course will give me a grounding to make this discourse possible.

This could be the year that magic happens for my students. I want my students to become critical thinkers and show growth in all aspects of their lives. I believe all children can learn despite their various backgrounds. My students are a group of 19 eager learners in fourth grade at a Title 1 school in an urban area. Having the opportunity to have their own personalized learning devices this year, heightens their interest for learning tremendously. My students are of diverse backgrounds and of varying academic abilities. Using personalized learning devices allow me to differentiate instruction for all and tap even more into higher order thinking skills. Assisting my class in obtaining styluses and earbuds will help maximize their learning in the classroom with their iPads. Each child will obtain the opportunity to learn at his or her own pace during guided math , guided reading and in other subject areas such as science, social studies and health. Students will use the earbuds to listen to instructional videos at their level of instruction. Since my students are of varying mathematical abilities, I plan to create videos to meet their needs. The students will need the earbuds to listen to the videos to reinforce concepts taught or listen to new concepts introduced. They will also use them to practice their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts. This will provide them with the automaticity they need for more challenging math concepts . The styluses will be used for assignments in Popplet, Book Creator and in Google Classroom. Students will also use both the earbuds and styluses as they complete research projects in Science, Social Studies and English Language Arts. For instance, as students brainstorm ideas for their personal narratives, the styluses can be used as a tool to input their ideas in Popplet. Students lives are made better as learning will be taking place with the integration of technology and on their level.

The mice that will be used will work without having to be maneuvered into the 'sweet spot'. It is extremely frustrating to try to learn to type on a keyboard that is not responsive, or that has certain keys that stick no matter what. The gift of new keyboards and mice would alleviate this problem. My students are trying to learn skills to help them be competitive in the workplace in the future.

They are two of the Outdoor Adventure Club class officers, and they want to make this year's trips 'the best ever!' I was amazed at the way in which they developed the project. All the officers of the Outdoor Adventure Club stayed late after one meeting and brainstormed all the trips they would love to take, but we simply can not afford. Once someone hit on the idea of going on a zip line, everyone was talking at once. I told the students about Ramblewild - an outdoor ropes and course with obstacles that meander from tree to tree at various heights through the forest. Two students took the lead. I gave them the questions from DonorsChoose, and they worked collaboratively over google Docs. to create the project. Ramblewild will give students the three hours helping each other climb through the trees to strengthen their bond and their belief in their own abilities. It is an awesome way to teach teamwork – all while challenging their limits in the outdoors! Students cannot maneuver from one obstacle course to the next by themselves. They must rely on each other to map out routes, plan each method of traversing the course, and stick together. This will require empathy for one another and group problem-solving as the courses can be quite difficult. Students will learn about sustainability. The 10-acre adventure park is owned by Feronia Forests, a corporation which encourages landowners to develop sustainable income opportunities, rather than using their land to harvest lumber. Ramblewild is an Eco-friendly adventure park high in the trees of a hemlock forest. All of the elements of the park are attached to the trees using tension, rather than bolts or screws, so the trees remain unscathed. Project Help Us Get To Ramblewild is about attracting teenagers who are not invested with nature and introducing them to it in an exciting and heart-pulsing way. Ramblewild is the trip that is the medium between being completely away from society and being a city kid. By writing this grant, we are taking a step forward as leaders by partly funding the adventure and becoming more beneficial members to the club. With the help of our fellow officers, we will facilitate a means to getting the job done efficiently and elegantly. News of this trip has already peaked the interest of many teens. The club does not sell itself to everyone. For most teens, any time away from modern luxuries is like a detention. We want to show teens the joy of nature and the connection we once had with it. We want to share the feeling of accomplishment from scaling mountains and many other things while doing it all together! The group’s main focus is to build a unified community inside the school of which we can all have at least one great memory in nature together.

They come from various cultural backgrounds and languages which creates a truly unique and diverse classroom. They are innovative, dedicated, brilliant, kind, and inquiring minds who rise to any academic challenge presented to them. They need stimulating and challenging academic exposure in order to help them reach their highest limit. We learn together in a large K-5 school that does the best it can for our population of students. Our school has a large ELL population and high needs for differentiation and authentic learning experiences. Our school is a family of teachers, support staff, and learners that truly care about one another. We work together to deliver the best for each and every one of our students. Finally, we believe that technology in the classroom could be a game changer for our amazing students. iPads would allow my students to be exposed to a wealth of information, applications, books, and resources that are otherwise unavailable to them. I would also be able to monitor their progress through the use of various applications that will allow me to differentiate my instruction and pave the way to academic success and excellence for my students. An iPad helps students who are kinesthetic and visual learners. It opens up the doors of education and individualize their learning experiences. The iPad will become a tool that will help create more authentic learning experiences in the classroom as well as build twenty first century skills that our children need in order to be successful in a quickly evolving technical world. My students will be able to work in centers with the iPads. They will help with writing, reading, and phonemic awareness skills. Finally, iPads will definitely impact and change their learning environment tremendously.","My students need Ipads.

Many of our students are first or second generation immigrants. The children come to us from a variety of different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Last year, I taught first grade and in the fall, I will be teaching Kindergarten. (The photo I have posted is from last year's class, as I have not met my class for next year yet.) My students are Kindergarteners. For some it will be their first experience with school, and I am looking forward to creating a warm and nurturing learning community for them! They will be 4 and 5 year-olds. They will be a community of curious, energetic, individual and unique children eager to make friends and learn new things! I'm so excited to meet my students in the fall!These wooden blocks will be a part of a play center in our classroom. Building with wooden blocks helps children develop fine motor skills, learn to be creative, problem-solve, work with others and nurtures a multitude of other skills! Play centers are also important for oral-language building skills, for instance, when children present their creations to the class and/or ask and answer questions about them.I believe play is very important for a Kindergartener's healthy holistic development. After recently reading the book Purposeful Play by Kristine Mraz, I learned about how all the different types of play are important for children in different ways. I think the addition of wooden blocks will provide my Kindergarteners with a greater variety of play experiences.",My students need wooden building blocks for creative play in our Kindergarten classroom.,Applied Learning,Grades PreK-2,Supplies,169.01,Fully Funded

They love exploring different ways to solve one problem; they think outside the box when finding solutions. In our classroom, we like to not only learn by listening, but also by seeing and doing. My students not only learn from me, but they learn from each other and themselves. My students are curious and eager to learn! With teamwork and perseverance, they can accomplish anything they set their minds to in my class! My students spend at LEAST 25 minutes each day independently reading. It is a very important part of the day where students learn to love reading and practice good reading habits. During this reading time, students are reading books that are at an appropriate level for them. This ensures they are not reading books that are too easy or challenging for them. My students self select 5 books each week at their level! They then store them in personal book bins for safe and easy keeping. Currently we have book bins but two major issues, most of them are falling apart and we only have 21, and there are 24 students in our class! My students deserve the best supplies and should not be using bins that are falling apart and that have been written on. Three of them are also temporarily using cardboard!

Despite the many challenges and differences my students present, I look to give each one of them a high quality learning experience that will set the tone for their later years in school. My students are thinkers and creators. They like to move, they love to read and love lots of positive attention. Many of them are being raised in single parent households and receive a free breakfast and lunch based on their socioeconomic status. These things may hinder them from getting ahead early in life and may not provide them with the life experiences many of us see as 'typical'. From the minute, they walk in the door of my classroom I focus on their social and surrounding learning. I may not be able to control their home lives, however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day. By doing this in a creative and positive way, I am hopeful to inspire even our earliest learners to continue on a path of academic excellence. The books will enhance the library in our classroom. We are a wide range of learners and have limited resources. Having a plethora of books readily available will help us become better readers but more importantly want to read. As an avid reader, I understand the importance of choices in titles and with these books; my students will open their minds and enjoy books. These books will enhance their reading stamina, interest and set the platform for later years in education. The Magic Tree House books will take the students on an imaginative journey into other worlds. This project I have done yearly and my students always love tracking where Jack and Annie go next. The books will enhance their science and social studies knowledge. The leveled reading sets will give my students the opportunity to have fiction and nonfiction books at their disposal so they are ready for any genre. It will increase their reading levels and make the year more enjoyable. In order to be a successful classroom, it needs to have the tools to learn.

Thes girls have the heart and determination to be better than they were yesterday. These girls are full of energy on the field and are full of life. Most of the students at our school come from low-income households that are not able to afford all the equipment their child will need to play a sport. Being a middle school team we do not have all of the equipment we need. We are always underfunded and always get high schools equipment when they get new equipment. With this being said I would like to provide my players with new equipment for how hard they work on a daily basis. My softball players will use these helmets every day to protect them. This donation would help my players that are worried if they are going to be able to afford to get the correct equipment they need for the season. These items will ensure the player's safety at games and at practice. This donation will help us start up a successful middle school softball program. This will help my girls know that there are people out there that will support them and help them. This generosity will show a reward on how hard they are working.

9011a9aec0f7d216f07613d6496ca1e9,Adapting To Changes,"I have a typical seventh grade class. My students are from a variety of socioeconomic and racial backgrounds. Many of my students' parents are in the military. The skill level varies from extremely high to extremely low. I have an average of twenty-five students in each of my five classes. Most are highly motivated learners and are very interested in science. They love technology and embrace its integration in the classroom. Fostering a love of learning and training lifetime learners is the main goal in my class. They are our future leaders. This year there have been many changes in my classroom. Our science benchmarks have changed and the class use of technology has increased. We have a greater focus on physical science in the state standards, so my students need chemistry kits to create models to achieve a deeper understanding of these standards. We have become a Google classroom and we use the technology to the best of our ability. The addition of an iPad will allow my students to video and research when they need it, instead of just when we are scheduled to have the media cart. Students often struggle understanding the concept of molecular makeup and atomic structure. If students are able to build models of these difficult concepts they will gain a better understanding of these benchmarks. The chemistry kits will allow a hands-on approach that will greatly benefit kinesthetic learners and visual learners alike. Students learn by doing and these kits allow students to create molecular structures and atomic models. The added use of these kits has the ability to create a great cornerstone middle school and high school chemistry. Every year my students create science videos of the benchmarks they learn in seventh grade. The students will be able to use the iPad for these videos and they can video other science demonstrations. Students will be able to peer teach each other by videoing demonstrations and science labs. Students will also help out their classmates by videoing important classroom lessons for future reference. All of these videos can be added to our Google classroom to be used as learning aids. The added technology will also be used for research in the classroom. Students will be able to have a reference aid right at their fingertips for research on science topics we cover throughout the year.","My students need concrete examples of abstract science concepts such as atomic and molecular models, plus an iPad and case to aid in research and video.",Math & Science,Grades 6-8,Computers & Tablets,765.99,Fully Funded

My students come from a wide range of different cultures, backgrounds, and even different languages. Regardless of what language they speak at home, music is a language in which everyone can communicate and share. 'Music is the universal language of mankind.' Henry Wadsworth Longfellow could not have put it more accurately. Music allows me to communicate with all students. It does not matter what language they speak, what culture they are from, if they have a disability, etc. Music speaks to all, and through music, I can speak to all. The Orff-Schulwerk approach (or Orff approach) is a philosophy of teaching music. It is designed around what kids do best: play. In an Orff classroom, children move, sing, dramatize, play instruments, and more. This developmental approach to teaching music encourages students to explore, collaborate, and express themselves through music. The Orff approach helps students find the joy in performing, without feeling judged by their classmates or their teacher. Everyone is treated as equals, even in regards to solos. This encourages the students to enjoy making music alone and in groups. In order for me to become a certified Orff teacher, I have to take a two week long course during the summer. There are three levels of certification, and I will be doing my first level.
