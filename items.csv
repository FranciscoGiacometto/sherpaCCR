Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo (Jean Reno) are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family).  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.""","""adventure, drama, romance""","""italy, suicide, diving, ocean, competition, father son relationship, oxygen, sicily, dolphin, apnoe-diving, dying and death, friendship""",1988,168,0.0,0.0,"""Luc Besson""","""Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno, Rosanna Arquette, Paul Shenar, Sergio Castellitto, Jean Bouise, Marc Duret, Griffin Dunne, Andréas Voutsinas, Valentina Vargas, Kimberly Beck, Bruce Guerre-Berthelot, Gregory Forstner, Claude Besson, Patrick Fontana, Alessandra Vazzoler, Paul Herman, Geoffrey Carey, Jan Rouiller, Pierre Semmler, Eric Do, Pierre-Alain de Garrigues""","""Gaumont""","""France, Italy, United States of America""",13.503815,7.6,364,"""fr""","""tt0095250""","""/w4TWqa7SiXP0Hm4rkRnCfXwIeRK.jpg""",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The actual villain, whose identity is never in doubt (Hitchcock made thrillers, not mysteries) is played by George Curzon, who suffers from a twitching eye. Curzon's revelation during an elaborate nightclub sequence is a Hitchcockian tour de force, the sort of virtuoso sequence taken for granted in these days of flexible cameras and computer enhancement, but which in 1937 took a great deal of time, patience and talent to pull off.

A high-ranking Nazi officer developed a plan to assassinate the three world leaders in order to undermine the Allied forces. He commissioned the German agent Max Richard (Armen Dzhigarkhanian) to carry out his plan, but it failed miserably due to the quick action and thinking of Andrei. While in Teheran, Andrei met a French woman, Marie Louni (Natalia Belokhvostikova), living in the city and they had a brief but intense affair. Nearly four decades later, the Nazi officer has been captured - but not for long. Freed by terrorists, the officer is hunting down the German agent who failed to carry out the planned assassinations.

Among other things, he weeps at Joseph’s funeral, throws stones in Lake Galilee when meeting Simon Peter and James son of Zebedee for the first time, dances at the wedding at Cana, and starts a water-splashing fight with his disciples as well. Satan is portrayed as a man in modern dress (and as a woman in red). During his temptation of Jesus, he shows him the Earth from the vantage point of space. Satan also shows Jesus images of wars and destruction carried out in his name. The film adds an apocryphal Roman historian named “Livio” who watches and comments as events unfold; he is presumably named after Livy.""","""history, drama""","""christianity, communion, jesus christ, last supper, bible, synagogue, resurrection, religion, jewish, judaism""",1999,240,0.0,20000000.0,"""Roger Young""","""Jeremy Sisto, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Debra Messing, Gary Oldman, David O'Hara, Claudio Amendola, Christian Kohlund, Jacqueline Bisset""","""Five Mile River Films, Beta Film, CBS Television, Lux Vide, Česká televize""","""Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, United States of America""",2.524781,5.4,8,"""en""","""tt0199232""","""/jkyll5jAzT6UT8gFp40e0iWzdYA.jpg""",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
