f20e27bbfb6507e596cc6a405589ca93,Engineers Are Designers,"Students need to be creators not consumers in the classroom. Bamboo Pen Tablets will allow my students to produce drawings and diagrams of their ideas digitally then display them on their ePortfolio websites. These devices will be used to construct sketches and plans in our STEM Engineering class. Fewer students in the United States are pursuing careers in engineering. This concerns me because engineers are the designers and innovators in our society. If we want to strengthen our economy we need to invest in our future and inspire students toward careers in engineering design. The new common core Next Generation Science Standards emphasize engineering and design thinking. This is an important shift in education from standardized teaching toward problem based learning. In response, I have created an engineering class which focuses on design thinking and problem solving. It is very exciting for our school, which is in Central California. We are a low income community and many students are disadvantaged financially. Many of my students have never been out of the city. They do not have many opportunities. This year has been the hardest for us. Our district is facing big budget cuts. Our spending has been frozen and reduced, which is why I am seeking funding outside of the school. The new Common Core is inspiring a shift from a focus on 'correct answers' to developing student ideas. Students come to the classroom with an entire belief system in their heads. It's important for teachers to find out what students think, uncover any misconceptions in that thinking, then challenge those misconceptions with activities and projects. An important piece in this strategy is to ask students to create explanations of their thinking. One way students do this is by drawing diagrams and writing about how systems like the carbon cycle work. With Bamboo tablets, students will be able to draw these diagrams on the computer and post them to their ePortfolio websites. Posting their work publicly on the web gives students more accountability for their learning. Also, students will use these devices to do art and 3D CAD design. This will allow us to move away from using paper which is more earth-friendly. And student work will be online for parents and the public to view! Newspapers tell us we have many high tech jobs available in the US but we don't have the skilled employees to fill them. Students do not have the thinking and collaborative skills that industry wants. I've created an elective class to focus students on these skills. We must develop student creativity and innovation if we want inventors and designers which will lead our nation in the world economy. We must give them tools like Bamboo tablets to inspire them to explore their creative talent.

My students are excited and eager to learn about anything and everything. The challenge is that we need math manipulative's so all students learn, create, and explore while being excited and motivated. My students that I have the pleasure to teach this year, are eager, appreciative, and bright young learners who are beginning their journey of education. Most of my students come from low sociol-economic families who cannot provide much more than their basic needs. The school qualifies for 100% free or reduced lunch. At my site, the majority of the students are English Language Learners.I want to inspire each and every one of my students to be creative, independent, and inquisitive. I want to provide a classroom environment that is stimulating and full of positive experiences. Every student deserves to have an invigorating classroom experience and I want to provide my students with as much as I possibly can. The math manipulative's that I want for my students will provide an excellent opportunity of learning for my students. With Common Core Curriculum being the new testing requirement for our students, hands on opportunities will be a perfect fit for every child. Each student will be able to explore the math concepts on their own and be able to describe how they have come to the answer. By being able to express how they have come to an answer helps them have a greater understanding for the math concept. Also, it fits to every child learning style. All students learn differently so these activities help differentiate instruction and allow for enrichment activities for the students. As an added bonus, the students love hands on activities. This makes them motivated to learn and to love math. They provide positive peer interaction and an overall exciting atmosphere for our students. Please help me provide more opportunities for hands on learning for my students. Education is so important for young learners and they will benefit tremendously from the use of manipulative's. If they can gain a great knowledge for mathematics now, then they will have a better foundation and thirst for knowledge as they journey through school.

My goal is to give my 7th and 8th grade students a knowledge and skill base that they can build on for the rest of their lives. With less than 60 days with each group of students, there is a lot to do in a very short time. I've got some of the best students in the world. We live in a rural Idaho community that still values 'vocational' education. My students are interested in learning skills they can use in their daily lives- possibly even for making a living. We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. Students will be mainly using these vices to make me deaf. Okay, not really. Vices are an essential tool in any shop- holding pieces to be cut, pressing bits together, hammering on the anvil, bending, the list could go on for miles. We mainly use these vices in my metals class- where I teach them how to punch holes in metal, set rivets, groove seams, and straighten projects that might have gotten a little off kilter. How will this make a difference? Well, It will let my students DOUBLE their productivity. Instead of 20 students in 2 lines waiting for a vise, I'll have 20 students in 4 lines waiting. They'll be a lot happier because they can actually get stuff done, and as a class they will have more time to go bigger with their projects!

These things work great, but there are some resources that are difficult and time consuming to make! We could really use some help! My students will begin with a pile of pattern shapes. They will discover different ways to sort them and share their ideas with the class. Then they will learn the names of shapes by saying them aloud as they toss shape beanbags back and forth. Next, we will learn about quadrilaterals. They will get to make their own on a geoboard. After that they will have new ideas for sorting, and can return to the pattern blocks to put their ideas to use! With the clay they will be able to create shapes. I can quiz them, and they can quiz each other. These concepts will be real to them as they touch and see each shape, as they hear the names while they move, and as they create which lets them feel ownership of each shape. Because their learning is based in their world, it will stay with them. They will look back and remember experiences rather than a foreign idea simply told to them. First of all, my students will love you if you donate! They are so excited. I told them that the resources may not come in time for them to use them, but they would be their for my future classes, and they were still excited! This is how amazing my students are!

The new materials would serve as a clean area for each student to call their own. Donations toward this project would drastically impact my students' lives. This project would contribute towards my efforts of creating a fun, safe, and clean learning space for my kids. ","My students need new seat storage pockets.

Last year I was fortunate to build a successful classroom but I am still lacking proper literacy and math centers that this order will fulfill! Our school is brand new and full of energy and life! The students and staff are excited to be there each day and it shows. The students exhibit Champion behavior every day while truly upholding our mission and embracing greatness in all of their learning opportunities. With the purchase of these new learning centers and manipulatives our students will be able to practice the skills they are learning in class by working with these amazing resources during center time which will help them to retain their new knowledge. They will be reinforcing math, science and literacy skills. These center box sets have been specifically designed to meet the standards that we teach in class.

I'm hoping to eliminate a lot of the frustrations my students experience in my Tech classes when they use our old robots by updating our set to the new and improved EV3 versions. We live in a rural Idaho community that still values 'vocational' education. My students are interested in learning skills they can use in their daily lives - possibly even for making a living. We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. With these new robots, students will be able to quickly and easily test out programs they've written. Most of the robots we currently use do not have working screens, and several of them have worn ports causing poor connections to motors and sensors. Being able to 'plug and play' will allow them to go further in their experimentation, and not only learn how the sensors work but also see what they see! With this knowledge I hope they will also be able to adapt their programs to compete in a classroom 'challenge' to see whose robot can navigate the maze. Technology changes at the speed of light. Having a new set of classroom robots will help my students keep up with the ever expanding field and give them an edge as they continue their education.

The children that I work with daily are so eager to learn and put forth so much effort. It is my goal to get these children to reach their educational goals In our building, we have the philosophy 'everyone gets what everyone needs.' We incorporate a MTSS framework that targets all students K-5, which ensures that all students are getting what they need in order to be successful at school. I currently have 14 students on my caseload. Disabilities range from Specific Learning Disabilities, to Emotional Impairments, to Other Health Impairments. Each student is working out of interventions to target their reading and math needs. Despite their large educational gap, these children are so eager to learn and be the best they can be. Children always get so excited when able to get their hands on new technology. Having iPads will enhance my students reading and math skills. They will be able to take what they've learned within our interventions and be able to generalize while doing different activities. There are apps that are tied directly to our math intervention, the iPads would allow my students to get extra practice and learn new skills while working with technology. Using iPads would also allow my students to have the feeling of independence. They need so much extra support throughout the day, being able to utilize different apps at their level would make them feel much more confident! Every student can learn, it just may not be on the same day, or in the same way. I'm hoping that with extra learning opportunities tied to technology, I will be able to close up the learning gap that my students currently have. Each child has a different learning style and pace. I believe that each and every child is capable of learning and succeeding. ",My students need iPads to further their learning when it comes to reading and math.

We, as a school, are working very hard to get them on or above grade level. This is a big challenge, but we care about the students' futures. Technology will help us get there! My students are great! We are always working on a classroom environment where everyone feels loved, valued, and respected. They work hard at school despite some challenges that may be at home. A lot of my students come from the Flint area, which means that running water would be a luxury for them. My students have so much potential to make a big difference in this world, and we are trying our best, as a school, to help them see that. Our school not only cares for our students but also their family and community. Technology is sparse at our school because our Title 1 money is spent on interventionists because our students are coming to us way below grade level. We recently received one iPad from another DonorsChoose.org project, and my students have loved every second of it. If we could have another one in our classroom, we could double the students that could use it. We will be using the iPad in a lot of areas but really focusing on reading and math. My students will be reading a wide variety of books which brings the library to them. My students will also be building their basic math knowledge that is the foundation of math to come. My students like to know that people care. When I told them we had received an iPad for our classroom, they were so excited. I'd love to share that we got another one. Being able to incorporate technology into their foundational reading and math skills is important. Technology is the future, and it helps students relate to the material being presented. My students will be able to have a library that has thousands of books at their finger tips. My students will also experience math in a fun way!

Students at our school are always willing to step up and be creative. They are willing to try new things and love learning about the world. In Geography, my 6th grades truly get to experience the world and I cannot give them enough real world examples. My students are going to study the world. I need updated maps to help show how the world is constantly changing. I choose atlases that have current information about each of the regions of the world so that they can learn information outside of our normal textbook, as the information is often out of date. Learning about the world is increasingly important in order to be part of the global community.

I also serve a split level classroom this year with first and second grade students. Students love that difference in the approach for learning. Doing something other than sitting at a desk in a chair. Students have an opportunity with the fun chairs, a bench, and mats to lay on and just enjoy reading. At a young age it is so very important to children to love learning or in this case love reading. I would love to be able to create that space for them here. As we work on independent learners, I want them to be comfortable; and these materials/furniture will help my students with that.

However, in terms of classroom supplies, they are used to sharing old, obsolete and sometimes barely functioning equipment. Three biology teachers currently share 6 electronic balances that may or may not function correctly on any given day. This means that lab procedures that should take 20 minutes can sometimes take 40 minutes as students line up to use electronic balances. Many of our students are on a free and reduced cost lunch program (46% of our population), and we have a high proportion of English language learners on our campus (32%). Despite this, our school has a vibrant campus culture with clubs and activities going on during lunch and recess most days. The rallies and athletic events are well-supported and well-attended. It is my belief that our students deserve the same equipment in their science classrooms that other schools in our district routinely receive from parent donations; however, our science programs are often hampered by limited funding. My project does not have the excitement of many others as I am simply asking for the funding to purchase 1 electronic balance. A single electronic balance does not sound like it will make much of a difference but when you have twelve lab groups and one student from each group responsible for collecting data thats 12 students in line. A single functioning electronic balance added to the room can halve that line to 6, if my other two balances are working the lines drop down to 4. Suddenly, the data can be collected in a timely manner during one class period. Suddenly we can move on to the analysis THAT day and not the next and the lesson has momentum and that makes a difference to learning.",My students need an electronic balance to allow them to collect accurate data in their labs in order to collect evidence to make claims,Math & Science,Grades 9-12,Supplies,472.19,Fully Funded
