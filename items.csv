My goal is to give my 7th and 8th grade students a knowledge and skill base that they can build on for the rest of their lives. With less than 60 days with each group of students, there is a lot to do in a very short time. I've got some of the best students in the world. We live in a rural Idaho community that still values 'vocational' education. My students are interested in learning skills they can use in their daily lives- possibly even for making a living. We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. Students will be mainly using these vices to make me deaf. Okay, not really. Vices are an essential tool in any shop- holding pieces to be cut, pressing bits together, hammering on the anvil, bending, the list could go on for miles. We mainly use these vices in my metals class- where I teach them how to punch holes in metal, set rivets, groove seams, and straighten projects that might have gotten a little off kilter. How will this make a difference? Well, It will let my students DOUBLE their productivity. Instead of 20 students in 2 lines waiting for a vise, I'll have 20 students in 4 lines waiting. They'll be a lot happier because they can actually get stuff done, and as a class they will have more time to go bigger with their projects!

Often we make our own supplies or make due with what we can find. We have used rocks and buttons to do multiplication. We used straws and candy for fractions. These things work great, but there are some resources that are difficult and time consuming to make! We could really use some help! My students will begin with a pile of pattern shapes. They will discover different ways to sort them and share their ideas with the class. Then they will learn the names of shapes by saying them aloud as they toss shape beanbags back and forth. Next, we will learn about quadrilaterals. They will get to make their own on a geoboard. After that they will have new ideas for sorting, and can return to the pattern blocks to put their ideas to use! With the clay they will be able to create shapes. I can quiz them, and they can quiz each other. These concepts will be real to them as they touch and see each shape, as they hear the names while they move, and as they create which lets them feel ownership of each shape. Because their learning is based in their world, it will stay with them. They will look back and remember experiences rather than a foreign idea simply told to them. First of all, my students will love you if you donate! They are so excited. I told them that the resources may not come in time for them to use them, but they would be their for my future classes, and they were still excited! This is how amazing my students are!

My project does not have the excitement of many others as I am simply asking for the funding to purchase 1 electronic balance. A single electronic balance does not sound like it will make much of a difference but when you have twelve lab groups and one student from each group responsible for collecting data thats 12 students in line. A single functioning electronic balance added to the room can halve that line to 6, if my other two balances are working the lines drop down to 4. Suddenly, the data can be collected in a timely manner during one class period. Suddenly we can move on to the analysis THAT day and not the next and the lesson has momentum and that makes a difference to learning.",My students need an electronic balance to allow them to collect accurate data in their labs in order to collect evidence to make claims,Math & Science,Grades 9-12,Supplies,472.19,Fully Funded

They are in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grade with both boys and girls. We are a title one school with over 60% of our students eligible for school lunch. Most students are not allowed to walk, bike, skateboard, or scooter to school and they lose out on a lot of exercise. Our school has always been able to achieve high fitness scores due to quality instruction and student performance. Mountain biking is an activity that most of my students never get to do due to the urban location of our school. Traffic is too heavy for parents to feel it safe to ride to school but our school has over 50 mountain bikes that our Physical Education students get to ride on campus. We need more helmets as ours are over 10 years old and several have broken so we do not have a class set. Research has shown that physical activity is also a main contributor to students academic success and we support that success through biking on campus. The physically active student will have better motivation and behavior in the classroom and biking on campus using these helmets will hep them succeeds as students.",My students need bicycle helmets to replace broken helmets for our 'Mountain Biking' unit.

They enjoy taking walks around the campus, cooking up new recipes and exploring the world through multi sensory activities. It's not the diagnosis that makes these students special; it's their heart and personality that really makes them special. Everyday my students make gains toward being more independent and I love celebrating every milestone. My students are all non-verbal multi sensory learners. They explore their environment through vision, sounds, tactile and oral sensory exploration. Throughout the day I work to make the required curriculum relevant and cognitively appropriate for my students. This has become increasingly difficult for me to do as a first year teacher of students with severe disabilities since I don't have many supplies. These materials will cover a variety of academic and functional skills. During my morning meeting, I will use the calendar supplies to teach patterning, counting, name recognition and eye tracking skills. The musical instruments will help to engage the students and follow along to calendar songs with musical beats. The students will be exposed to common daily words in an engaging manner. This is especially important for my English Language learner students. The academic materials will be used to help the students learn to work independently by doing tasks such as sequencing events and sorting colored bears. They will learn important fine motor skills by using adaptive scissors and use the foam paint to expose themselves new textures and colors.

My students will learn to follow instructions, wait in line, and self soothe themselves.

Many of my students are first generation or second generation immigrants. My students love reading and the books they read shape the way they see the world! In first grade children discover what it is to truly understand a book, fall in love with a character, go on an adventure or learn about their favorite nonfiction topic. My students are exploring this new world with eagerness and enthusiasm and reading up a storm. Our classroom library needs more diverse books. The books that come in pre-created sets that are delivered to the school overwhelming feature white characters and white families. Some of our books are very old and out of touch with the times. All children should have an opportunity to see themselves represented in the books they read. Children get excited about characters that they feel they can identify with. The added benefit is that their reading levels improve when they are more excited about their books. All children need to see diversity in books to better understand our world.

This makes our school pretty special in so many ways. They all work so hard and are very deserving of this grant. My students are inner city students who have to overcome so many obstacles before they even walk through the doors at school. I hate to see them get here and not be able to focus on anything else because they are hungry. This grant will allow my kids to grab snacks for before and after school if they need it.

I want my students to love reading as much as I do and I know being able to 'get away' with a good book would help them to love reading more. Your generous donation will allow my students the materials they need to make their learning more rewarding. I work in a Title I school and my students don't always have the supplies they need to achieve success. We also have very few copy machines and therefore my students are not able to write and mark on their papers because they have to share them with other classes. Please help my students reach their full academic potential by providing them with a classroom that has the amenities they need to be successful students and people. Thank you for your support. Teaching in a Title I school has its rewards. However, it also has its obstacles. These supplies will assist my students in being able to create effective work, as well as, help to keep them organized. A lot of my students don't have computers at home. I would like them to be able to print and copy things in their classroom therefore having a printer copy machine would benefit them. My students also do a lot of independent group work, having the lap boards would help them be able to communicate in a way that's not only verbal but also visual. I find it very useful to use technology in the classroom and watching videos on specific educational websites are paramount in my teaching. Having a set of speakers will make it so my students can hear the videos that I play in the classroom. My students also help me create bulletin boards and other displays in the classroom. I feel that having some of the materials that I've asked for will help them to be successful in creating their visions. When students don't have the proper resources now, it's difficult for them to be truly effective in the future. Time management and good organizational skills are something every effective student needs.

Many of our students are first or second generation immigrants. The children come to us from a variety of different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Last year, I taught first grade and in the fall, I will be teaching Kindergarten. (The photo I have posted is from last year's class, as I have not met my class for next year yet.) My students are Kindergarteners. For some it will be their first experience with school, and I am looking forward to creating a warm and nurturing learning community for them! They will be 4 and 5 year-olds. They will be a community of curious, energetic, individual and unique children eager to make friends and learn new things! I'm so excited to meet my students in the fall!These wooden blocks will be a part of a play center in our classroom. Building with wooden blocks helps children develop fine motor skills, learn to be creative, problem-solve, work with others and nurtures a multitude of other skills! Play centers are also important for oral-language building skills, for instance, when children present their creations to the class and/or ask and answer questions about them.I believe play is very important for a Kindergartener's healthy holistic development. After recently reading the book Purposeful Play by Kristine Mraz, I learned about how all the different types of play are important for children in different ways.

Despite the many challenges and differences my students present, I look to give each one of them a high quality learning experience that will set the tone for their later years in school. My students are thinkers and creators. They like to move, they love to read and love lots of positive attention. Many of them are being raised in single parent households and receive a free breakfast and lunch based on their socioeconomic status. These things may hinder them from getting ahead early in life and may not provide them with the life experiences many of us see as 'typical'. From the minute, they walk in the door of my classroom I focus on their social and surrounding learning. I may not be able to control their home lives, however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day. By doing this in a creative and positive way, I am hopeful to inspire even our earliest learners to continue on a path of academic excellence. The books will enhance the library in our classroom. We are a wide range of learners and have limited resources. Having a plethora of books readily available will help us become better readers but more importantly want to read. As an avid reader, I understand the importance of choices in titles and with these books; my students will open their minds and enjoy books. These books will enhance their reading stamina, interest and set the platform for later years in education. The Magic Tree House books will take the students on an imaginative journey into other worlds. This project I have done yearly and my students always love tracking where Jack and Annie go next.
