I am sure it is not the old, hard, heavy chair that my students need to use every day. I teach third grade in a very low-income neighborhood in California with 100% of my students receiving free or reduced meals and 90% are English language learners. It is a very diverse population with Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Indian, and Black students. Many of the students are considered high-risk due to the conditions in which they live (gangs, violence, and drugs). They are also the most charming and eager students anyone could hope to meet. My students thrive in an atmosphere that is consistent, fair, and filled with many opportunities to express themselves Imagine going to work every day and having to sit in old, hard, heavy chairs. It is not a comfortable learning environment for students. They spend more than half their school day sitting in these chairs. The Virco Zuma chairs are comfortable, light weight, ergonomically designed with the student in mind, and the cool cantilever shape makes sitting down fun! When children are sitting correctly, they can spend their energies focused on learning rather than on finding a more comfortable way to place their bodies. These ergonomically styled chairs will help this year's class learn in a comfortable environment as well as many futures classes to come.

It sounds silly, but I thought, 'Okay, the way the world works can be changed.'' Jay Silver We want our students, who are learning about how the world works, to understand that their ideas can bring about powerful change. We live in a community with a mixture of low-economic families and middle-class families. Many students have limited English, but they work very hard. Their parents are very supportive and work with their children to ensure success in school. Our students are bright and motivated. They enjoy learning about and using new technology. They amaze us with their ideas and willingness to persevere when faced with a problem. Our students have been creating products digitally, and we are ready to go to the next level and use the skills they have learned to have an object come to life. We think the best way to get started is with the Lego Robotics kit. Students will then be able to design and create a robot of any style and with any function. Seeing their designs come to life will allow our students to experience a true 21st century classroom. The skills students will acquire by learning to use a true robotics kit will help them throughout their school career and into the workforce. We want to provide an environment where creative ideas can be nurtured and developed and the students' ideas can come to life. Our students have brilliant ideas.

It is mandatory in our state approved curriculum that the children receive at least an hour nap. I would like for my students to sleep on cots that are not worn by years of use. New cots would provide better comfort for the children. My preschool class consists of 3 and 4 year old children. My students are very eager to learn and are very energetic. My school is located in the inner city. The Early Childhood department of my district has made great efforts to supply every child within this city the opportunity to a highly qualified free preschool education. The children will use the requested materials during nap time. The children will each have an individual cot placed around our classroom for them to rest on before the afternoon session begins. This will give the children a chance to 'reboot' before continuing with the rest of our day. My project will make a difference because the children will have a clean, sturdy, and comfortable place to rest. This will allow the students to continue with the rest of their day with a heightened energy level which will cause them to be more attentive, alert, and focused on learning.

All of our students have hearing loss, ranging from mild to profound. In addition, some of our students also have other disabilities including autism, cognitive delays, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy. Many of our students enter preschool with almost no language. They do not know how to communicate their wants and needs to adults or peers. As Teachers of the Deaf, we rely heavily on pictures and visual aids to introduce very basic vocabulary. It is our job to help our students learn to communicate with us, their families, and the outside world. This can be either through sign language, assisted sign, oral communication or a mixture of these modes of communication. Our preschool team would like to purchase one iPad for every classroom. An iPad can be a wonderful visual tool to introduce basic vocabulary, and there are fantastic applications that target specific skills such as advocacy, sign language, listening therapy... not to mention practice with preschool skills such as shape matching, counting and letter identification!

In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the TEACHER is most important.' I could not agree more. As a third grade teacher and life-long learner, I encourage my students to explore and go beyond the walls of our classroom. My class of 13 boys and 11 girls is a lively one. This group of children is first kind and cooperative with one another. They set their personal academic goals, and respect individual starting points knowing our class objective is growth for all. Our school and district is quaint and clean. It is full of caring parents, staff, teachers, and administrators. We are not a wealthy district or community, but we make do. The kids greet me at the door each morning with a handshake and smile. They come ready to learn, yet teach me something new each day!The technology available to the students is limited and outdated. This restricts both my ability and theirs with regard to exposing and exploring all the wonderful things that lie beyond our little school, district, and community. Technology is not the be-all and end-all of education, but it can provide children with experiences that they might not otherwise have growing up in a small somewhat rural town. I am seeking an iPad with a protective case for my classroom. The protective case with 24 third graders is self-explanatory, but let me share with you the purpose of the iPad. Technology of today has opened the door to more resources than one can imagine for adults and children alike. On a daily basis, my children would be able to utilize various online literacy and math programs which are not available to them outside of the school. These programs support the struggling student, the 'average' student, as well as the student who is ready for the next step in their education. Having an iPad would allow more children the chance to engage in these learning opportunities. More importantly, an iPad in our classroom would provide children with the ability to listen to books while following along. This will build fluency, as well as expose the children to a wider variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction with their specific needs and interests taken into account. The addition of an iPad to our two classroom computers (each over two decades old) will not revolutionize my teaching, as I believe what Bill Gates has said, 'Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is most important.' However, I also believe your model of generosity and kindness will make a difference in my students' lives. To know there are people in the world who care about both children and education is powerful. Thank you.

One of the biggest obstacles my students face is a lack of confidence in their ability. It breaks my heart that they don't see what I see in them! I want to build them up by showing that the more a person reads, the better he/she becomes at all things academic. My students come from an impoverished background and have faced much adversity, and I want to help give them a taste of reading success to propel them into productive, purposeful adult lives. My students will use these books as a part of an independent reading initiative I will be starting in the New Year. As a first year teacher, I am realizing that gaps in reading will only be closed by doing reading itself. Having a library will allow me to have books on hand for my students to be able to read both in and out of my classroom. By having high interest books in my class, I can visually promote reading and literature while also having an immediate means of making recommendations and starting dialogue around books my students are reading. I am excited for my students to become avid readers through having more access to books in which they would be interested in reading. Thank you in advance!

I have a small room that serves as an office and treatment space for children with communication deficits. My approach is to directly teach children the communication skill they need and then allow for practice and carryover through play with peers. My school has a wide variety of programs ranging from severely disabled students in both primary and secondary life skills classrooms, to the district level gifted program, in addition to a K-5 regular education elementary program. My caseload includes students with autism, selective mutism, intellectual disability, language disorders, and developmental delays. My project is specifically designed for those students with autism and selective mutism. I work with them directly on social communication skills which is very stressful and difficult for them. Many of them dislike school due to the anxiety caused by having to communicate with peers and adults. I have had success with having them come into the speech room with a buddy or two and complete puzzles, play board games or build with Lego's. My supply, however, is quite low and I am in need of a bigger variety of high interest puzzle and building toys to keep their engagement and enthusiasm up as well as their peers. With the addition of the puzzles and magnetic toys I've requested, my students will have more choices of what they can do with their speech buddies. The few items that I have used to date have allowed one of my students with significant anxiety related to autism and selective mutism to begin to build friendships with two other boys in his class. He is able to practice looking at others when he speaks, asking questions, initiating conversation, and being flexible when interacting with others. His mother reports that he no longer fights coming to school because he has something to look forward to every day before lunch. This project will allow my students to practice their communication skills, make friends and have fun while working on speech, social communication, problem solving, and language skills. High interest activities like I have selected will be motivating for them and allow for carryover of their skills in a more natural setting of playing with peers.

Over the years I have watched the kindergarten curriculum increase in its educational requirements as the common core standards for students leaving kindergarten have soared to very high heights for our youngest learners.

Adding round spacious and comfortable tables to the classroom will allow the students to work both independently and collaboratively. Students will have their own space to keep their materials better organized which will help make their learning endeavors more productive and successful. In addition, the round collaborative feel of the tables will also allow many opportunities for the students during group activities to communicate with each other and create collaborative projects.

Because I teach Transitional Kindergarten, my students come to me from all over our school district and are given a chance to experience Core Curriculum through instruction in visual and performing arts, culinary arts, music, drama, movement, and dance. Their creative, original work is shared all over campus, and each trimester at 'Presentation Nights.' One of the most beautiful elements on our campus is the incorporation of special needs students into our arts programs. Even though my students start school as four-year-olds, they quickly become responsible caring students and are encouraged to be collaborative learners. I am proud of the way my students embrace their classmates with special needs and treat them with respect and dignity. My project, 'Block Heads' is fueled by my belief that, when given interesting resources, students are inspired to problem solve. The simplicity of building blocks provokes the imagination of children. In order to build what they imagine, students have to figure things out, work together, and fail until they succeed. I have watched my students use the few blocks we have to create skyscrapers, airports, race tracks, homes, castles, parking garages, ramps, towers, train stations, and even a zoo! Block building has been a powerful motivator for my bilingual students to learn to communicate with their peers, and it has allowed my special needs students to play successfully alongside their classmates. The most significant work the children do as they play, is learn to share ideas, and collaborate to complete their vision. Even students with limited vocabulary can communicate ideas, and participate in block play. My current wooden block collection is small, so only a small group of children can play with them. I would love to see many small groups using blocks to build toward a common goal. For example, if one group is building an airport, another group might build a parking garage or restaurant that would support the airport. Blocks can compliment any curriculum theme. I believe that vocabulary is a predictor of academic success. If a child can imagine it, build it, and talk about it, later that same child will be able to write about it, and share reasons for his or her own ideas and experiences. I love the statement, 'good writing is good thinking.' It is my belief, that by creating a classroom full of 'Block Heads', my students will think better, and in time, they will be able to write better, calculate better, reason better, and create better.

Students will have an opportunity to listen to stories using a fun and exciting program called MyOn during literacy centers and work on important math skills during our daily math centers using an engaging online program called StarFall. The donation of the iPad will make a huge difference for my students in helping them move forward in their learning and being on grade level as they gain new reading and mathematics skills.'Technology is not an event. It's just part of everyday learning.'","My students need one iPad to help them reinforce, practice and enhance their skills in reading, writing, and mathematics.","Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Computers & Tablets,477.06,Fully Funded

Many students in my room are speakers of another language. The students struggle with basic math skills but they are eager and excited to learn. Many come from homes where very little English is spoken so parents are not able to help them with the challenges of math real world problems. Many do not come to school with a number sense. My students love the math manipulatives in my room but they are not allowed to check them out to help them to be able to practice their skills at home. Please help them get the Rekenreks or Math racks for use at school and home. My second grade classroom is a place hard working students learning at every turn! Our student goals include preparing to be successful third graders next year but also to have fun collaborating every day too! In my 10 years, I have discovered that students really need a balance of engaging hands-on learning, independent work, as well as technology to prepare them to work in the 21st Century. This year I have 24 incoming 7 year-olds, but I only have a limited amount district-provided Chromebooks. Additionally, the Chromebooks are not necessarily up to date. New Chromebooks will allow us to practice and gain experience with Google Docs, Slides, and Chrome which is fully implemented in grade 3 and beyond in my district. In order to provide a more balanced approach in my classroom and to better utilize my existing resources, I need a few more devices for my students. I feel like six Chromebooks would perfectly compliment our other tech equipment and allow my students to utilize technology on a daily basis.","My students need 6 Chromebooks to allow them to study and read about animals, science concepts, different countries, communities, and cultures.
