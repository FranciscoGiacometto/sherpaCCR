Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family).

It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.Ben-HurThe entertainment experience of a lifetime.William WylerCharlton Heston, Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Stephen Boyd, Hugh Griffith, Martha Scott, Cathy O'Donnell, Frank Thring, Sam Jaffe, Ady Berber, Finlay Currie, André Morell, Terence Longdon, Lando Buzzanca, Giuliano Gemma, Marina Berti, Robert Brown, Liana Del Balzo, Enzo Fiermonte, Richard Hale, Duncan Lamont, John Le Mesurier, Ferdy Mayne, May McAvoy, Aldo Silvani, Ralph Truman, George Relph, Joe Canutt, Richard Coleman, Antonio Corevi, David Davies, Mino Doro, Michael Dugan, Franco Fantasia, José Greci, John Horsley, Howard Lang, Stevenson Lang, Tutte Lemkow, Cliff Lyons, Tiberio Mitri, Remington Olmsted, Laurence Payne, Aldo Pini, Diego Pozzetto, Stella Rho, Edwin Richfield, Hector Ross, Maxwell Shaw, Gianni Solaro, Pietro Tordi, Raimondo Van Riel, Dervis Ward, Joe Yrigoyen, Nazzareno Zamperla, Jerry Brown, Eddie JaureguiMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)United States of America"

The obligatory ""fish out of water"" scene, in which the principals are briefly slowed down by a banal everyday event, occurs during a child's birthday party. The actual villain, whose identity is never in doubt (Hitchcock made thrillers, not mysteries) is played by George Curzon, who suffers from a twitching eye. Curzon's revelation during an elaborate nightclub sequence is a Hitchcockian tour de force, the sort of virtuoso sequence taken for granted in these days of flexible cameras and computer enhancement, but which in 1937 took a great deal of time, patience and talent to pull off.

After a successful tour across the US, the Rolling Stones gave a free December concert at Altamont Speedway in California with the Grateful Dead, Ike and Tina Turner, Jefferson Airplane, and the Flying Burrito Brothers. The band unwisely selected the Hells Angels to provide security, and the bikers resorted to violence to keep the stoned, restless, and often naked crowd in line. The result: dozens of injuries and the on-screen stabbing of a young black man (during ""Sympathy for the Devil"") by one of the concert's staff security. In a manipulative but effective move, the Maysles brothers filmed Mick Jagger in the editing room witnessing the on-camera murder for the first time.

A copyist is urgently needed to help the composer. A fictional character is introduced in the form of a young conservatory student and aspiring composer named Anna Holtz. The mercurial Beethoven is skeptical that a woman might become involved in his masterpiece but slowly comes to trust in Anna's assistance and in the end becomes quite fond of her. By the time the piece is performed, her presence in his life is an absolute necessity. Her deep understanding of his work is such that she even corrects mistakes he has made, while her passionate personality opens a door into his private world.Copying BeethovenNoneAgnieszka HollandEd Harris, Diane Kruger, Matthew Goode, Phyllida Law, Ralph Riach, Bill Stewart, Angus Barnett, Viktoria Dihen, Matyelok GibbsSidney Kimmel Entertainment, Anomaly EntertainmentGermany, United States of America"

Feuillade’s well-meaning response to this brow-beating was another serial, the 12-part epic entitled Judex. The Plot: When his family is ruined by the unscrupulous banker Favraux, Jacques de Tremeuse resolves to bring him to justice. Adopting a disguise and the name Judex, he captures the crooked banker and takes him to his secret lair. Learning of Favraux’s dishonest ways, his daughter Jacqueline gives away his wealth when she learns of his death.

Fritz Knobel (based on real-life forger Konrad Kujau) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. When Knobel writes and sells a volume of Hitler's (nonexistent) diaries, he thinks it's just another job.  When sleazy journalist Hermann Willié learns of the diaries, however, he quickly realizes their potential value... and Knobel is quickly in over his head. As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting. The film is a romping and hilarious satire, poking fun not only at the events and characters involved in the hoax (who are only thinly disguised in the film), but at the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.Schtonk!One of the first funny german look at its past.Helmut DietlGötz George, Uwe Ochsenknecht, Christiane Hörbiger, Harald Juhnke, Ulrich Mühe, Rolf Hoppe, Dagmar Manzel, Veronica Ferres, Hermann Lause, Martin Benrath, Georg Marischka, Karl Schönböck, Rosemarie Fendel, Wolfgang Menge, Hark Bohm, Willy Harlander, Thomas Holtzmann, Hans-Joachim Hegewald, Peter Roggisch, Günter Junghans, Armin Rohde, Michael Kessler, Martin FeifelBavaria Film, Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)Germany"

The new league did the unthinkable by playing in the spring and plucked three straight Heisman Trophy winners away from the NFL. The 12-team USFL played before crowds that averaged 25,000, and started off with respectable TV ratings. But with success came expansion and new owners, including a certain high profile and impatient real estate baron whose vision was at odds with the league’s founders. Soon, the USFL was reduced to waging a desperate anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, which yielded an ironic verdict that effectively forced the league out of business. Now, almost a quarter of a century later, Academy Award-nominated and Peabody Award-winning director Mike Tollin, himself once a chronicler of the league, will showcase the remarkable influence of those three years on football history and attempt to answer the question, “Who Killed the USFL?”Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?For three glorious years, football was 365Mike TollinDonald Trump, Burt Reynolds, Herschel Walker, Mike TollinTriple Threat ProductionsUnited States of America"
