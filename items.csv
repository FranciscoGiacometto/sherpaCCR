They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. We have a rapidly expanding band program. If the rate of growth keeps up, I will not be able to get instruments to all the students who want to join band next year. I have been acquiring instruments in every way I can, but even with the used instruments I've been able to acquire, I haven't been able to keep up with the need for instruments among students who couldn't otherwise afford to rent or buy one from a music store. This instrument will not only give many students an enriching opportunity to learn to play the clarinet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing this clarinet could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music.

6efa4cf55f68328042b47ad570ea4742,Eye Hand Coordination For Lower Grades,"All students, including the Marcy students, love to try new things and challenge themselves. Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

My students will be adults in the next few years, but have had few opportunities to learn appropriate cooking skills. I teach a class for students with moderate to severe disabilities. My students all attend a public school and spend some time in a special education setting and some time with their typical peers. They have a wide range of skill levels and abilities, but they are all on a functional life skills curriculum, meaning their goals in school are to learn basic skills required to navigate life. With the addition of cooking supplies, including a skillet, a griddle, a crock pot, and kitchen utensils, my students will have the opportunity to learn to make and/or assist in making simple meals. We will be able to make a wide array of foods traditionally cooked on a stovetop including pancakes, tacos, and spaghetti. They will also be given the opportunity to try new foods that they have not tasted in the past, broadening their food preferences through experience. By donating to this project, you are helping my students learn skills that will last them throughout their life.

Working at a Title I school comes with several challenges. Over half of my third-graders are on free or reduced lunch. Two-thirds come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. It's no surprise that so many of them struggle with comprehension. By the time students enter my classroom, most of them have learned to read fluently, but have little comprehension. Reading without meaning is a recurring problem year after year. With this project, I hope to be able to set up small learning centers that will allow my students to practice comprehension skills in a variety of ways. I hope to show them how to take small chunks of high-interest text and carefully examine each piece. My students will learn how to utilize graphic organizers to find the evidence that supports their answers. With the activities funded through this project, I hope to bring meaning to my students' reading. I want to show them that there is a purpose with all reading we do, whether it be learning new information or for pure entertainment. I hope to create life long readers!

Kennedy. A powerful statement that empowers me to provide my students with fun and interactive ways to keep their minds bursting with knowledge. My students have bright smiles that light up the classroom despite their disabilities that range from moderate to severe diagnosis. Each day they are exposed to functional learning experiences that engage their minds and help them to understand the world they are living in. Our school community welcomes students with disabilities and promotes an inclusive setting. It is in these exclusive settings that my students are able to work with their same age peers and develop friendships. Physical Education is an important part of my students' fine and gross motor skills development. My students need more instructional time to master movement concepts and instruction needs to be engaging, creative, and fun! The target toss and comet balls are one of the ways my students can work on their motor skills. The activity mats, toss and catch play set, and balancing spoon game are also ways to promote skills development while also teaching them cooperative play. These hands-on active play resources will help my students gain the practice they need not only through the school year, but also while attending summer school. Additionally, my students will also be learning new vocabulary, practicing math skills, and learning some science concepts. By having these additional opportunities to learn these academic skills, my students will begin to generalize the concepts and learn that language, math, and science can be done outside while having fun in the sun! As a first year Special Education teacher, my goal is to provide my students with the necessary skills to learn at their individual levels, while introducing functional concepts. The best way to accomplish this is to provide a variety of learning opportunities in multiple learning modalities. That is why this project is important to me. Your donation will help me expand our functional curriculum to the outdoors and that will not only benefit my students this year, but in years to come. Thank-you.

My students are learning all subjects, including social skills and functional skills. My students need to attend a Civil War reenactment experience to bring history to life. This would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the majority of my students. I have attended the Civil War reenactment, and I am positive that this field trip would be one that they will not soon forget. Not only will they get to see the Blue and the Gray at battle, they will also get to go through an encampment and see how Civil War soldiers lived during that time.

b9c058d4923f04e9cf4138f3f5960e70,Helping Students Focus and Achieve,"We do all we can to use technology in our curriculum, though many of our students cannot afford a set of headphones. When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

'Show me, I forget, tell me, I remember, involve me, I understand'~Carl Orff. We are rebuilding a program and starting from ZERO and need ways to INVOLVE our students in music making! My students are K through 6th grade at an inner-city school in Minneapolis with a diverse population including Hispanic, African American, and Somali students. We are an Open School where students are taught to be critical thinkers and give their own voice to each project they embark on. Hard working, enthusiastic, and extremely joyful, they devour all arts opportunities presented to them. They LOVE to create and perform and jump at the chance to share their creations. 'Orff Instruments' (in this project, xylophones) are specifically designed for elementary and middle school use. Students not only use them to learn and accompany known songs and pieces, but more importantly to create their own arrangements, compositions, and solos. They are a fabulously accessible instrument that allows all students to participate in music making. They also help dramatically in differentiation- students and the teacher can tailor learning to the needs of each student by making the music as simple or complex as appropriate. Students will perform large pieces in an ensemble, accompany songs in the classroom, and create their own arrangements and compositions. The general music program at our school is being rebuilt from the ground up- we started the year with an empty room. With extremely limited funds we are not able to purchase these, or many other, instruments and classroom supplies. Ideally, someday we will have one instrument for each student in the class.

They do not know how to communicate their wants and needs to adults or peers. As Teachers of the Deaf, we rely heavily on pictures and visual aids to introduce very basic vocabulary. It is our job to help our students learn to communicate with us, their families, and the outside world. This can be either through sign language, assisted sign, oral communication or a mixture of these modes of communication. Our preschool team would like to purchase one iPad for every classroom.

To keep my students engaged and excited about learning we do stations. During stations, small groups of students spend time working on a specific skill, like phonics. Twenty minutes later, we rotate to a new station to practice another skill, vocabulary. The same is true for math, students rotate from working on money, to telling time, to using numbers. Stations allow students to practice multiple skills, and work cooperatively with others. Using stations, I am able to meet with smaller groups of students or even one on one to reach students who need extra support in a given area. Stations provide a predictable routine for students, with embedded cooperative learning skills, and academic challenge. My students love stations!

They make connections between Literature and Nonfiction, and what is happening today, in the real world. We debate, discuss, and infer together, and everyone is encouraged to 'show what they know'! Our school is unique because we are a public school but gifted, regular, and disabled students all attend classes together and there are lots of opportunities for cross grade interactions. It is normal to see students of all ability levels playing basketball with two students in wheelchairs, or a 4th grader teaching a 1st grader to sound out words, or how to design a catapult! Some 4th grade students visit 5th grade once a week because we do what is best for kids. We are an IMPACT Academy, that stresses Problem Solving and Positive attitudes, and as the front of our school announces, 'All students are welcome at Garden Grove!'. This year we will have 35 students in each of two fourth grade classrooms. We want to extend our Literature Circle book sets to include a Science Fiction genre (When you Reach Me), a realistic fiction (Because of Winn Dixie) and a Historical Fiction (By the Great Horn Spoon). Since we only receive about $100/year for books & supplies, these extra book sets, and art supplies of paint, pencils, paper and pastels are critical for our extension projects to provide readers additional ways to revisit what they've read, and continue the conversations and discoveries to create even more meaning. Game Boards, CD Covers, Character bookmarks, collages, ABC books, commemorative stamps, accordion books, paper story quilts and salt dough maps are some of the planned projects. Extra kids mean extra books and supplies needed! No one should be left without a book or art supplies! As more and more students are packed into our classrooms, we sometimes forget the power of one book-one student. While it is true students could share novels, there is something magical about curling up on the rug with your own book, reading at your own pace, and getting lost in that literary world for a while each day. These few extra sets of books mean one book/child . The art supplies mean there are enough supplies even for students who come from homes who cannot afford extras.

We are in need of high interest books that are engaging so students find the joy of reading and see themselves as life long readers. Our school is diverse with students speaking many different languages. We are a Title I school where more than 55% of our students receive free and reduced price meals. As a school we value our diversity and as a school community, we work hard to ensure students have access to resources and instructional strategies so they can be successful life long learners. These high interest book sets will be added to our school's book rooms so teachers can check out books for guided reading, strategy groups and book clubs. These book titles selected are an assortment of various genres including, graphic novels, nonfiction, mystery, realistic fiction, and fantasy books. They will engage our readers and help them think deeply about their reading. Within small groups, students will share their thinking and discuss the stories which will enhance their oral communication skills, reading comprehension and vocabulary. These book sets will enhance the selection of high interest books for our students. They will hook our students into reading with engaging stories and/or factual information which will encourage them to build their reading stamina, knowledge and thinking skills.

2e0bd42ab93aac86f58cf593e71f193d,A Table Big Enough for Everyone!,"How many of you value and cherish your personal space? My students are very cramped whenever we meet as a small group! We need a new table to remedy our situation! Eighty five percent of the students attending my school qualify to receive free and reduced lunch. My 3rd graders come to school everyday because they know it is a safe place where someone will protect and care about them. They come from broken families, or parents who work multiple jobs just to pay rent. It is hard for them to continue their learning at home because parents are working hard to make ends meet, or they simply don't have any materials to work with. Due to this fact, many of them are below grade level, and struggling to get caught up. To help my students, we work in small groups on a regular basis. We gather around our table for reading, math, and writing just to name a few! Unfortunately, sometimes the small group is eight students, and we have to sit at a table made for six (if even)! Students don't have space to put all of their materials, much less enough space to put their arms on the table and write comfortably. With this new table, there will be enough space to seat eight students. Plus, the table is scalloped, so each student has their own area. This will cut down on time moving, adjusting our chairs, and figuring out how to fit everyone's material on the table. We'll be able to get so much more work done, and continue learning! This table will help us learn so much more in our day! Right now, transitions from subject to subject are taking up valuable minutes. Without students needing to continuously figure out where to place materials so everyone is able to work, we'll be able to have more productive class time!

69e235927bc6a5c7dd65e45a8506dc73,A Kind Circle of Friends,"A classroom that is full of smiles, communication, collaboration, creativity, and laughter is a classroom where learning is taking place! Receiving round tables for our classroom will allow my students endless opportunities to complete individual and collaborative activities daily. Putting the fun and love of learning back into the classroom is the ultimate goal of every teacher. Over the years I have watched the kindergarten curriculum increase in its educational requirements as the common core standards for students leaving kindergarten have soared to very high heights for our youngest learners. The curriculum lessons and expectations for reading, writing, and math, provide little time to focus on the importance of the 4C’s of learning (collaboration, cooperation, creativity, and communication). My goal is to provide my 24 students with every opportunity to engage in the 4C’s of learning by providing them with collaborative furniture and creative learning materials that will guide them through their educational journey in a positive and caring way. Our youngest learners are eager to learn, I simply want to design a positive learning environment that will help make their educational journey enjoyable. Adding round spacious and comfortable tables to the classroom will allow the students to work both independently and collaboratively. Students will have their own space to keep their materials better organized which will help make their learning endeavors more productive and successful. In addition, the round collaborative feel of the tables will also allow many opportunities for the students during group activities to communicate with each other and create collaborative projects. As an educator, these tables will give me the opportunity to monitor my students more efficiently and effectively during both individual and group time activities. Providing opportunities to become a team member throughout the school day and work collaboratively with peers is always a win-win situation. Donations towards this project will help provide a positive learning environment that focuses on the importance of social growth and educational happiness. My goal is to help my students learn how to work cooperatively with their classmates and will allow them the ability to use their positive communication skills not only in school, but throughout their lives. These tables will help make collaboration more attainable and will make it easier for my students to work together as a team.

I work with students in grades K-12 that have serious medical issues such as cancer. They all live in high poverty areas. It is a joy and a privilege to work with these students. Some students have life threatening conditions such as cancer. Other students are on the transplant list waiting for an organ transplant. A few students have been hit by a car or were in a car accident. Most of the students experience pain on a daily basis. All of my students are very brave and are a pleasure to work with. In addition to their serious medical problems, all of my students reside in high poverty areas. Most of my students come from single parent families. The families are in need and spend a majority of their time taking their children to medical appointments and to the hospital. My students need a laminator, art supplies, paper, various writing materials, and mailing envelopes so they can create projects to share with others in the world. Our school lacks basic supplies. With these supplies the students will be able to use hands-on learning in their lessons. Students will create projects, mail them and share them electronically with others around the world. They can post them in the hospital to bring joy and encouragement to others! Since my students are under a great deal of stress and most of the students have chronic pain due to a serious medical conditions, integrating art and hands-on learning into our academic lessons is necessary. Project based learning helps students develop critical thinking skills. The families love to see the books and projects the students' create. Laminating the projects helps families battling cancer save the students' precious work forever! We share the projects with the community and families. We create research presentations. This helps to develop students' critical thinking and analysis skills. We integrate math, art, technology, english and science concepts. Students create sophisticated writing and research projects. Students write books and letters. Brave students battling cancer inspire others with their work. Students can save these projects forever!

The best learning occurs when students have the chance to collaborate with their peers. Throughout the day I have the opportunity to work with 96 students. Due to increase class sizes, we have had the opportunity to use a second classroom. This classroom currently has a wide variety of left over desks and tables that were left over from other schools in our district. While this works, it is not an ideal learning environment. Students sit at desks of different shapes and sizes that do not best allow for group work. We are looking to create a classroom environment that is truly inviting to all students. We hope to arrange our classroom so that students can easily collaborate with one another on projects and academic tasks. These tables will allow us to work with students in a more collaborative manner. Our goal is to help facilitate students in a way so that they can learn from one another. In sixth grade, it's extremely important that students have the chance to interact with one another to complete academic tasks. Students need just as much practice working with one another as they do on their math skills. These tables will allow students to easily collaborate with each other throughout the school day. Table tops provide a much needed workspace while also providing the students a more structured way to learn from one another.

What if you needed a tissue for your runny nose...but had to use toilet paper or a paper towel? Healthy and happy kids make for bright and healthy learners. My students come from a very low socioeconomic status rural area in North Dakota. Little things, like getting a tissue when their nose is runny, or counting the minutes until lunch because the last time they ate something substantial was the day before school, plague my students on a daily basis. It is difficult for them to focus on their studies and learning when they are dealing with rumbly tummies. Most of my students do not even have essentials such as Kleenex or pencils to use during class. I want to distribute the snack during my reading group in the morning. This will tide the students over until lunch time so they can focus on their reading, and not their tummies. A vacuum, hand sanitizer, and cleaning wipes will help ensure my students will stay healthy throughout the school year. Little things such as Kleenex, pencils, and a paper sharpener are things my students wish they had on a daily basis. My students will become become better learners and will be able to focus when their normal, everyday, daily needs are being met. The students will be able to focus on reading and vocabulary, and not on growling tummies and pencils. The student's lives will be tremendously affected by this donation. Students have a really hard time focusing on reading when they are worried about how far away lunch is. Students will be able to not worry about the inability to have sharpened pencils during class time when they know they will have access to one in the classroom. A clean classroom not only keeps students healthy, but it will keep moral and general attitude positive.

With a great start to their educational path, they can do anything they choose! The kindergarteners in my classroom come from ethnically and racially diverse backgrounds. Many speak English as a second language and are refugees to the country. We are Title 1 school and many children receive reduced-price lunch. They are excited to learn and love being at school! My students need engaging books and manipulatives that capitalize on their experience and interests. These materials will be used in our classroom library to help them practice their budding reading skills independently and with partners so that they can reach their reading potential. Kindergarten sets a foundation for school success. In kindergarten, many reading skills are taught, but children learn the best through hands-on activities and need books to read at their own levels. These leveled books and manipulatives will provide students the opportunity to practice their skills and learn to love reading! Students need access to engaging text that represents their own experiences, interests, and culture. Currently, our library is stocked with few books that reflect the students in the room. These new materials will engage our little readers so that they learn that books reflect themselves and reading is for everyone. Because they are leveled, the ability to differentiate for all learners comes to life. Differentiated instructional strategies best meet the needs of each individual child.

I want my students to love reading as much as I do and I know being able to 'get away' with a good book would help them to love reading more. Your generous donation will allow my students the materials they need to make their learning more rewarding. I work in a Title I school and my students don't always have the supplies they need to achieve success. We also have very few copy machines and therefore my students are not able to write and mark on their papers because they have to share them with other classes. Please help my students reach their full academic potential by providing them with a classroom that has the amenities they need to be successful students and people. Thank you for your support. Teaching in a Title I school has its rewards. However, it also has its obstacles. These supplies will assist my students in being able to create effective work, as well as, help to keep them organized. A lot of my students don't have computers at home. I would like them to be able to print and copy things in their classroom therefore having a printer copy machine would benefit them. My students also do a lot of independent group work, having the lap boards would help them be able to communicate in a way that's not only verbal but also visual. I find it very useful to use technology in the classroom and watching videos on specific educational websites are paramount in my teaching. Having a set of speakers will make it so my students can hear the videos that I play in the classroom. My students also help me create bulletin boards and other displays in the classroom. I feel that having some of the materials that I've asked for will help them to be successful in creating their visions. When students don't have the proper resources now, it's difficult for them to be truly effective in the future. Time management and good organizational skills are something every effective student needs.

They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. Our band program has been expanding so quickly that I do not have enough instruments for my students. Since starting at my school in 2012, the number of students in band has grown from 38 to over 200! This is a great problem to have, but even after years of generous donations by countless individuals, finding affordable used instruments, and borrowing/trading with other schools, we still don't have enough instruments for every student who wants to be in band. These trumpets would mean three students who can't otherwise afford an instrument will be able to participate in band. These instruments will not only give the students that play them an enriching opportunity to learn the trumpet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing one of these trumpets could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music. This project will bring three trumpets into my classroom and into the hands of students who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford this experience.
