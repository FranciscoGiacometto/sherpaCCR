Try reading a well-designed comic! And while you're at it, learn how to use quotation marks in your writing!Our city school serves children from all socio-economic levels in its Montessori, Designed Instruction, and regular classrooms. My students all struggle with reading, writing, and mathematics because they have a learning, health, or other disability. They are the best kids in the world, and I love to find ways to make their hard work pay off quicker and in multiple ways. Reading today's Comic-Style books has so many benefits. The words are leveled, the graphics are designed to teach emotional response ('read that with expression' just became easier) and strong story lines show all the elements of a good story. And BONUS! We can use them to understand just what goes into those pesky quotation marks classroom teachers demand third graders to use. With these Comic-style books, my students will also learn how to analyze plot, storyline, and problem/solution. This will make sense as they learn to plan their own writing.I've seen my students learn to read, and many use the stories we've read to provide a basis for their own writing. This is GOOD! Now my classroom needs books that will enable them to do this at a lower level. The TOON books, several of which have won awards, will make that easier.

We need your help to supply our special education classroom with some working technology to help contribute to the success of our students. Our school district is based in a low income town. Our middle school has a specific program called the Target program. The Target program supports students with emotional disorders. Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly. Our students deserve a chance to interact with today's technology and they deserve to do so in fast and productive manner. If our students have the opportunity to learn 21st century skills, they will be able to practice skills that can be used in their bright futures. The information they will be able to learn, and the creativity they will be able to channel through a computer will help meet many of their educational goals.

My classroom houses many different cultural backgrounds of students-students who speak different languages besides english, low income, and high income. It doesn't matter the race or age of these students. I have one goal in mind-to build a lifelong love of reading. If my students had chromebooks, they could access digital content. My students could access their literature series and take advantage of all of the digital components: note taking, access lessons, take tests/quizzes and receive immediate feedback, and annotate their thinking as they read.

This is our classroom in a nutshell. By adding iPods to our classroom, the students will have the opportunity to engage in reading in a new way! Using iPods will allow them to listen and follow along with the readers words. Children love listening to reading and by focusing in on the reader, the students are given a rich, fluent example to follow in return.

Some of my students are better at math, others love science or sports but they all arrive excited and ready to learn every day. Everyone's learning has its own time-table. I have students who catch on like lightening while others who are just as enthusiastic need extra examples or some individual help. I have 11 who are new to the program this year so it would be very helpful to have mini-ipads available for the ones who finish early. They could visit webpages I have created for the class, play games in German or visit some of the many children's educational websites available in German while I work with small groups or individuals. Some of our families do not have Internet access at home so this would be a good opportunity for those students to experience using to internet to reinforce their learning. The amount of comprehensible input a learner processes is directly correlated to his/her level of success. In other words, the more German I can give them in meaningful and interesting ways, the better their proficiency will be. The ability to function in more than one language is certainly going to enrich their lives and widen their horizons at every turn.

My students and I have decided to do a monthly service project to give to those in need. I want to give back to my class by having this project fully funded this month. I teach 27 fourth graders in a fabulous school. Our mission statement states, 'We are building stronger minds, bodies, and spirits together.' I think this applies to everything we do. Each year our school makes donations to Make-a-Wish, Pennies for Patients, Animal Shelters, Zoos, and many other organizations. We are a hard working, dedicated, and caring community striving to make the world a better place one act of kindness at a time. We know that our actions will ripple throughout the community.

In order to complete all of these tasks, we are going to need this project fully funded. You could be a part of our ripple of kindness. We have requested items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, granola bars, and soap to make care packages to donate to homeless shelters. We have requested pre-made care packages with snacks for our heroes in our local community (police, firefighters, etc) and for our heroes overseas (our American soldiers fighting for our freedoms). We are truly grateful to have the resources to be able to provide these service projects to make our world a better place and bring a smile. There's no better feeling in the world! We believe that bullying doesn't exist when students are working together to better the lives of those around them. Each act of kindness is a small reminder of how we are working as a team to build a stronger community. And we do have to work together for this to succeed.

My students have some disadvantages in their life but at the end of the day, all they want to do is learn. They are passionate about discovering what they don't know and learning more about what they already understand. Please help make this a reality for them! My classroom is comprised entirely of students with severe behavior issues across 3 grade levels. Included in my classroom are a number of students with severe ADHD and other behaviors that have greatly impacted their learning. These students do not respond to traditional pencil and paper learning. I teach in a self-contained classroom, my students come to me from around my district after they have struggled in their home school. The school that I am at has a staggeringly high poverty rate, and my entire room is comprised of high poverty students. Many of my students feel like they have been written off by every adult in their lives. They all desperately desire to learn, though, and are hungry for a chance to read. Throughout their lives they've been made to feel like learning is something that they never will be able to achieve, but they are passionate to prove those naysayers wrong. My hope with this project is to continue using an alternative way to engage my students in learning. Throughout my building, teachers are experimenting with technology as a way to reach some of our most reluctant learners, including students with severe ADHD. We are seeing tremendous success with unique forms of technology that students in our building have no opportunity to see at home. In our room we have 3 NOOKS and they are always being used. Students are always clamoring to use them, and I simply can't keep up with demand. Students who previously refused to read are reading entire novels and novel series. These NOOKS have been game changers for us. The iPad mini will be a great teaching tool to help differentiate learning and continue to get students reading. There are a number of applications geared to reading that my students would greatly benefit from. This will be immensely important in a multi-age classroom where students are working at all different levels. My students need an iPad Mini to give them a more engaging way to interact with literature, alternative learning, and technology. Finding a way to engage my students in their own education is my greatest challenge, and this resource will make that challenge more attainable for so many more of my students.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom.

As they develop this project together, they are also working as a team to market and spread the word about this campaign so that it is successful. Once the students have received this 3D printer and filament, so many more opportunities will be open to them. From learning to code and design their own projects and inventions, to the problem-solving, and persistence required to refine their projects, the students will be able to develop the hands-on learning experiences needed to increase their STEM awareness and 21st Century Skills that are so necessary to their future. Our goal is to make our ideas and projects come to life with a 3D printer. The addition of a 3D printer to the Academically Talented program will allow us to actually apply our learning in real ways, rather than just through discussion or writing. This 3D printer is not only for us, but for all of the current and future students in the program. We are leading this project not only for ourselves, but for the younger AT students as well. We are not only researching and typing up this campaign, but we are planning a media campaign within our school and community to create awareness for our project. This project is important to our school and community because it will provide us and the younger Academically Talented students with a multitude of opportunities that were not available before. We will be able to learn about coding and project design as we become the engineers. And while we, the 8th grade class, will be gone in a year, what we have done for the AT program will not.

The are now eager to take these projects to the next level - from simple 3D objects to programmable, functioning robots using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. From the day they started working with the 3D printer, my students have been brainstorming what they can print and make. Printing simple objects has been interesting, but they are eager to tackle more advanced projects and challenges. They have seen fully, functioning robots using 3D printed parts programmed with controllers like Raspberry Pi 2 and the Arduino Uno R3, and decided this was the next step they wanted to take. Through the combination of our existing 3D printer and the programming capabilities of the Arduino Starter Kits, my students will be able to learn and apply their knowledge of coding to real-world situations. They will be able to work cooperatively as a team, designing and printing the parts needed to construct their robots, and then program their robot to complete a task. According to Eric, 'Our project is to expand our engineering skills and our knowledge of electronics customization by obtaining two Arduino Starter Kits and two Raspberry Pi 2 Starter Kits. Combining our 3D printer with these kits, we can create a balanced, electronics driven curriculum that inspires ingenuity and opens minds to the vast world of robotics, programming, and the creation of objects that can change the world.' This project is important not only our class, but also to the classes and students below us. We understand that we will be leaving this school at the end of this year, but we also understand that this project will not only benefit our learning during our last year, but will benefit the younger students in the Academically Talented program. This project will solve the main obstacle we currently face with our 3D printer curriculum. We are able to print nice objects for projects, but we are not able to use those objects and parts to program working electronics and robots. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi will allow us that next step in our engineering learning.
