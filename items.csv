Try reading a well-designed comic! And while you're at it, learn how to use quotation marks in your writing!Our city school serves children from all socio-economic levels in its Montessori, Designed Instruction, and regular classrooms. My students all struggle with reading, writing, and mathematics because they have a learning, health, or other disability. They are the best kids in the world, and I love to find ways to make their hard work pay off quicker and in multiple ways. Reading today's Comic-Style books has so many benefits. The words are leveled, the graphics are designed to teach emotional response ('read that with expression' just became easier) and strong story lines show all the elements of a good story. And BONUS! We can use them to understand just what goes into those pesky quotation marks classroom teachers demand third graders to use. With these Comic-style books, my students will also learn how to analyze plot, storyline, and problem/solution. This will make sense as they learn to plan their own writing.I've seen my students learn to read, and many use the stories we've read to provide a basis for their own writing. This is GOOD! Now my classroom needs books that will enable them to do this at a lower level. The TOON books, several of which have won awards, will make that easier.

2274d68de7068287375b9d025ceba625,Collaboration Station in the RJE Learning Commons,"We are acquiring more and more technology at RJE, mobile technology, in particular. While this is exciting, we struggle to find spaces for students to use it. I feel that if we have a fun, kid friendly space that will facilitate an environment of collaboration and teamwork, kids will flock to it! RJE has 636 students, and they are very social. They love to play together and work together. In fact, teachers encourage students to work together to encourage cooperation and compromise. It also allows our students to learn from one another. They like the affiliation aspect of learning. My goal is to use our collaboration station area for working in groups, particularly with technology. We are fortunate to have many iPads on our campus that are intended for student use. With the collaboration station, students could use our tablets or other devices and collaboratively work on a project. They could even use this shared space to visit and communicate with students outside of our campus via Skype or Face Time. The furniture that I am requesting will facilitate a coworking environment and encourage children to work together and use our mobile technology in a collaborative, cooperative way. I would be thrilled to offer my students this modern learning space for their studies. I want to provide a book store or coffee house setting that will appeal to our 21st century learners as well as accommodate discussions and our mobile technology. I am requesting a 5 piece Wesco Modular Square Soft Seater that sits low to the ground and will accommodate up to 8 students and/or staff. Each piece is a bright color and there is a center piece for materials and such. Currently, we have rectangular tables, which are well suited for classes and meetings, but they are not ideal for a small group, who may want to meet privately and/or have small group discussions. With the furniture that I am requesting, the seating will be perfect for small groups that are working on a project together, and a perfect place for students to use mobile technology together. If RJE receives this seating option, I will complete the collaboration station by adding a stationary iPad. I want to provide our students with furniture that will be fun and colorful. Schools must align their classroom environments with real world environments in order to prepare our students for the future. To do that, schools must practice the 4 Cs: critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity. My students need a go to space to work together that will allow them to talk, ask questions, and practice their critical thinking skills.

My students are energetic fourth graders who love when hands on activities can be incorporated into math lessons. I work in a Title I school where many of my students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. My school does not have the funding to buy many extra materials such as math manipulatives for classrooms, so math time can be a challenge for some of my students. My fourth-graders need concrete, hands on practice with different fraction concepts. I am requesting fraction pieces in tile and circle form to help my students visualize fractions in different forms. I am also requesting fraction games to give my students more practice with manipulating fractions. My students are always much more willing to practice math if the math topics are presented as a game! The Common Core State Standards for fourth grade have a strong focus on fractions, including finding equivalence, adding, subtraction, multiplication, and ordering of fractions. These fraction manipulatives will allow my students to easily visualize fraction problems and be more successful at the tasks that they need to accomplish. Math topics build on each other and without a strong base many students struggle in math class. I want my fourth graders to have a strong foundation in math so that they can continue to build their math knowledge and be successful in school.

The students come from diverse backgrounds. Our community is just outside a larger city. Our district consists of 2 elementary, a stem academy, middle school, and a high school. I am requesting 2 listening centers to hear books and write about them during Daily 5 small group time. These listening stations come with a CD player station with headphone connection and headphones for 6 students. We currently have two CD players, one with a broken tape player and one with a broken CD player. The connection for the headphones I currently have has a short in it so we are not able to use headphones right now. We have to play the tape or cd on low volume while reading groups are simultaneously going on. This new listening station with working headphones will make life easier and quieter during reading instruction. We really need a working listening station for our reading group time.

My middle-school speech kids are predominantly inner city African American males. The stigma of not being able to pronounce sounds correctly has a big impact on their lives. They are reluctant to speak in class, fearing they will be made fun of (and they often are). They have even gotten into fights because of their speech. They work hard in speech therapy, but despite their best efforts, there are a few sounds they struggle to master (especially /s/ and /r/). Cutting edge therapy tools, such as Speech Buddies, will give these kids a chance of conquering their targeted sounds. Speech Buddies are radically different from other articulation tools. They go where the Speech-Language Pathologist can't, directly into the student's mouth, to teach the exact placement of the tongue and lips in order to make sounds correctly. It is my hope that the Speech Buddies will be just the thing to help my students, whom life has not given a fair shake, to sound like their peers and give them the confidence they need to succeed in school.

Often they are at a disadvantage because they have difficulty providing for themselves the required resources they need to be competitive in school. To be successful in calculus, my students need to constantly practice their learning and acquired skills and knowledge by doing homework, which more often than not requires a graphing calculator. I would like to have extra calculators that I can check out to them to help them with their homework. This project will help decrease my worries that my students will not be able to do their homework because they do not have the required resource they need at home.

The touch screen facilitates easy use for tiny fingers still developing fine motor skills. The highly visual and animated delivery of iPad educational apps captures their imagination, motivates their desire to learn, and provides the authentic use of technology to master essential knowledge and skills. We are requesting three iPads. One of our teachers previously received an iPad through a grant. If this Donors Choose project is funded, the iPads will be placed permanently in each classroom. The use of the iPads will offer a plethora of appealing, hands-on learning experiences that will facilitate the mastery of kindergarten skills. The iPads will be utilized by independent student use in literacy and math stations. Students could use Tellagami, Videolicious, or Puppet Pals app to retell or create their own fairy tale. Another possibility would be to use Educreations app to describe the plant cycle or their animal research. Haiku Deck could be used to show their learning about landforms or science tools.

I teach 27 fourth graders in a fabulous school. Our mission statement states, 'We are building stronger minds, bodies, and spirits together.' I think this applies to everything we do. Each year our school makes donations to Make-a-Wish, Pennies for Patients, Animal Shelters, Zoos, and many other organizations. We are a hard working, dedicated, and caring community striving to make the world a better place one act of kindness at a time. We know that our actions will ripple throughout the community.

I teach in a self-contained classroom, my students come to me from around my district after they have struggled in their home school. The school that I am at has a staggeringly high poverty rate, and my entire room is comprised of high poverty students. Many of my students feel like they have been written off by every adult in their lives. They all desperately desire to learn, though, and are hungry for a chance to read. Throughout their lives they've been made to feel like learning is something that they never will be able to achieve, but they are passionate to prove those naysayers wrong. My hope with this project is to continue using an alternative way to engage my students in learning.

I have high expectations and I want all children, even ones with labels to achieve to their highest potential. My students are from a rural community, about 60 percent receive free and reduced lunch. Our school is the main attraction in the community. Most activities revolve around the school. Many of the children come from farming backgrounds or their parents commute to work. My students will use these resources daily. The whole class will benefit from 'brain breaks' that the bubbles and lights will provide. I will have a special sensory corner that students can enter when a break is needed. Students will be able to choose to go there or it can be suggested by me. The balls will be held by anyone that feels that it will help them, I will also suggest it for someone that is struggling. The essential oils will be used to create a calm atmosphere. Students will be able to attend longer with the visual breaks and the sensory tools (balls) will allow students to fidget but maintain focus during a lesson. The sensory corner in the classroom will allow children to take a short break and return to the learning quickly. Some students have meltdowns or lose control when frustrated. These tools would allow them to stay in the classroom and get their needs met in a positive way versus time outs or time in the principal's office.

They want to learn in a manner that suits their own personalities. My students are 21st century learners, meaning they love technology and overall are kinesthetic learners. I think giving them choice and opportunity to do work wherever they want in the room is motivating and beneficial to their learning experience. Since every child is different, I believe in having different choices and opportunities for them. They love having a voice and choice in their seating arrangement and activities during the day. My dream is to set up my classroom like a coffee shop. When you go into a coffee shop to do some work, you have choice. I don't have someone telling me my spot for the remainder of my time there. I have the choice to pick my seat. I also have the choice to change my mind and sit somewhere else during my time at the coffee shop. My students love the opportunity to have a voice in the classroom. Having different seating options will really help them in determining where they want to complete their work. Setting my classroom up as a coffee shop will really emphasize the type of learning environment my students want and need. I want to lower one desk and have the deluxe sit-upons as an option for students who want to work at a desk but in a different way.

In our classroom alone we speak 5 different languages and call several countries home. My students are diverse in socioeconomic background and home environments. Many students do not have Internet access at home, and some live in a mobile home community. I have several gifted and talented students eager to create and learn. Although they come from various backgrounds, one thing they have in common is their enthusiasm to learn. They are an energetic, and a very gracious group. Dash & Dot robots are hands-on learning tools that teach creativity, problem solving, and coding to children. Children can see their code come to life in a real-world, hands-on way that engages them fully in the concepts they are learning about. As robotics and computers become increasingly prevalent in students’ lives, understanding programming concepts is becoming very important for students’ success. Students will work in small groups to develop their collaboration and communication abilities as they learn valuable 21st century skills. Help my students get introduced to STEM early and cultivate their skills for the opportunities of today’s world. The possibilities are endless for these robots and I can’t wait to use them in all subject areas to enrich my student’s learning.

They often struggle with the day to day challenges that face them in the classroom, and can become overwhelmed very easily. They want to come to school to learn and make friends, but due to their challenges, they often have a hard time doing so.I would like to create a special sensory rich classroom for the students in my school to be able to access throughout the day before they reach sensory overload. This classroom will be a place that they can spend time and feel safe. The sensory tools included in this special room will be used by numerous children on a daily basis to help them be able to relax and get their emotions and feelings back in check to be able to function in their classrooms. These tools could be the life line for many students to help them better perform in a typical classroom. When special needs students begin to feel overwhelmed, they often begin to show behaviors that disrupt the classroom. The rocker, weighted tools, tilt board, and headphones will allow my students enough sensory input to realign their bodies with their minds so that they can function. These tools can be used in the sensory classroom, or checked out by individual teachers to help these students transition into general education classrooms so they can be included like all children.

Students vary in their learning styles from auditory, visual to kinesthetic. Learning is impacted for students with special needs who require additional supports. Active seating will help my 2nd grade students to stay engaged in learning by providing some wiggle room to move in their seats. As content grows more demanding for students, I have noticed an increased need from students for more movement. These Hokki stools allow students to stay seated while they rock back and forth (subtle movements) assisting their need to move during those longer necessary periods of teaching time. The Hokki stools will be used for students who struggle with impulsivity and focus. They will be used to support self-regulation to stay focused and complete their learning tasks.

Even students who were absent can see what happened in the classroom and avoid that 'lost' feeling when they return to school.","My students need a Swivl cam as a way to record audio and visual understanding of concepts and behavior and show other students, the teacher, and parents what they've learned.","Applied Learning, Literacy & Language",Grades 6-8,Books,738.61,Fully Funded
4f4ced226bb4207e89022302a7a81e94,Conversations About Books,"Our students are country kids that enjoy reading when they have a chance to choose what they want to read. Our kids are great kids. Many communities say this but it's true about our kids. Our kids need books that they enjoy and they need multiple books that they can enjoy so that they start to talk about those books! It is my goal to provide those books so that more reading conversations can take place! If kids don't have adults who are showing them reading, they won't read and this helps. Having multiple students reading the same books gives them a chance to engage with their books in ways that they don't usually get to engage. Kids need engaging material but we need it in multiple students' hands in order to foster conversations about reading. These books will foster conversations about topics in books that kids enjoy and get kids talking about reading and off of their phones. When kids see other kids reading books that are recommended, they ask for those books and this project will make those books available to more kids to get them reading and talking. Reading is the key in education for every subject area and for success in school and out of school. Conversations about books is about getting kids engaged in something other than technology and games. I am requesting a wide range of popular literature titles to increase our reading options.",My students need books to have conversations about in and out of the classroom.,Literacy & Language,Grades 9-12,Books,677.19,Fully Funded
ca5a00578f61d4aa0bdf29f77ebed426,Each Group Needs to be Heard,"I am fortunate to teach in a caring and supportive community. Most of the families have lived in the area for generations. The community supports its schools despite the fact that its residents are low socio-economic population. Due to decreasing enrollment at the school, the school is in financial distress. Our school parents, like all parents, want what's best for the education of their children. They give as much as they can to fund supplies and consumables that go to the classrooms. However, the financial problems of the school have negatively impacted every classroom. Our student-teacher ratio is extremely high and students are often crammed into classrooms that are too small to allow them much room to comfortably work. I actively look for ways to facilitate teaching and learning, allowing my students to move and collaborate while learning in a rich and welcoming environment. I have flexible seating options and desks that can be easily arranged for a variety of tasks. I want the students in my class to be excited to enter the room each and every day. Each and every one of my students is priceless to me and so is their education. Swivl camera tracks the speaker, whether that be a teacher, an individual, or a group of students. It will record individual or group presentations. Student collaboration and presentation skills will be enhanced through the frequent use of this device. Parents, teachers, and students can review and rewatch the presentations anytime, not just during school hours. Additional audio markers allow for different groups of students, or individuals, to record their conversations so that all students can partake in presentations. Groups and individuals can isolate their audio tracks so parents, teachers, and other students can verify content mastery from each group or individual.
