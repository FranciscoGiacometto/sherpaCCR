0501b7062bce7c6879dda813e700a1be,Computers For Special Education,"Have you ever tried completing something on a slow computer? Sometimes it seems like we have dial up internet. We need your help to supply our special education classroom with some working technology to help contribute to the success of our students. Our school district is based in a low income town. Our middle school has a specific program called the Target program. The Target program supports students with emotional disorders. Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly. Our students deserve a chance to interact with today's technology and they deserve to do so in fast and productive manner. If our students have the opportunity to learn 21st century skills, they will be able to practice skills that can be used in their bright futures. The information they will be able to learn, and the creativity they will be able to channel through a computer will help meet many of their educational goals.

My classroom houses many different cultural backgrounds of students-students who speak different languages besides english, low income, and high income. It doesn't matter the race or age of these students. I have one goal in mind-to build a lifelong love of reading. If my students had chromebooks, they could access digital content. My students could access their literature series and take advantage of all of the digital components: note taking, access lessons, take tests/quizzes and receive immediate feedback, and annotate their thinking as they read.

a899883781f28b25a779bbfc678c2497,Common Core's Cozy Classroom Corner,"Every morning we begin the day at the carpet area with a fabulous book. It might be a book to jump start a math lesson or one that goes along with our Essential Question of the Week or one having to do with character building. Whatever the reason for the book, the reason for the carpet is the same. I want to provide a cozy area for children to fall in love with books, reading, and math. Unfortunately, 22 of my 26 second graders read at a Kindergarten reading level or lower. When you struggle with something, it is hard to fall in love with it. I LOVE reading and have so many books, all of which I have leveled through the Accelerated Reader Program. Each of my books is color coded and in a color coded tub to make it easy for kids to find a 'just right' book. However, I don't have enough 'beginning reader' books for my 22 beginning readers to each have several books to read at their level at a time. Just as bad as not having enough books, is the fact that our carpet is disgusting! It has stains on it and never comes quite clean. Custodians 'deep clean' it every summer. I have even brought in a carpet shampoo machine (shh, don't tell on me!) but the carpet remains filthy. It's over 20 years old and I was told that if it isn't falling apart, it isn't a priority. What else can I do? Envision a group of the sweetest, most wonderful 6, 7, and 8 year olds sitting comfortably on a brand new dinosaur alphabet rug, totally engrossed in a story their teacher is reading to introduce the next Common Core math concept. Imagine those same children during reading time excitedly choosing to sit on this colorful rug and read a book from the bountiful boxes of books we just received from Donors Choose, boxes full of books that inspire them because they can read these books that are 'just right' for them. Picture the students who are reading at or above grade level taking the station activities out of the box and independently choosing a topic, reading up on that topic at the rug, and then writing reports based on their new knowledge at the recently delivered writing desk that is fully stocked for them. Visualize those same children volunteering to share that new knowledge with the class by inviting them over to the fresh, clean rug area. What an amazing classroom that would be! These books, stations, rug, and desk will inspire my students to want to read, knowing that there are books they CAN read and a comfortable, clean place to do the reading at. They are such a fantastic group of kids who WANT to do better. These items will change their lives and give them the confidence they need to succeed and the motivation to keep trying, no matter how difficult it may be at times, knowing that there are other people out there who care!

Some families have chosen to commute long distances to be able to attend our school. I know a family that travels almost an hour very morning to drop there child off by 7:30am. They are excited and vivacious and eager to learn! But most importantly, they believe in our school. My school is a new school that opened August of 2014. It is a year round, collegiate prep school that believes in educating the whole child without the demands and anxieties of too much testing. The teachers are creative, energetic and has taught on very little resources, furniture or curriculum. Yet they are happy because they are also vivacious and eager to teach! Our school has built a community where everyone loves to be there and learning is rigorous. Through the use of the 8 Apple iPads and iPad protectors, my students will be learning Literacy Skills through technology. The Apple iPads will primarily be used inside my classroom through Kindergarten Literacy Center time where I will enforce their literacy skills through apps that enrich alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, reading and reading comprehension. With a splitter, each iPad will be used with 2 students at a time collaborating together to enhance these skills. The Apple iPads and iPad protectors will also be used for class intervention groups for at risk students in Language Arts and Math inside my classroom. The students will practice grade levels standards that are connected to the common core that they have particularly been struggling with. With this extra piece of intervention I will be able to guide our students to become more confident and successful in their educational career.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life. They are healthier emotionally and intellectually. When you're a reader, anything is possible. Please help our students realize this.

I teach at an economically disadvantaged school where approximately 90% of my students receive free/reduced lunch. In addition, many of my students are English Language Learners, and students with special needs. Despite these obstacles, they come to school with a curiosity, and love of learning that is unparalleled. Words cannot express the pride and love I have for each and every one of them. They are the true heroes. Student choice is at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Choice is what sets the passive learner apart from the active learner. My project will make a difference because it will offer my students the ability to move their bodies, to choose where they will the most successful learner. Currently, our class room is comprised of 24 desks and chairs...not fun! If my students want to venture off to read independently, they do so on a bare floor or place mats purchased from the Dollar Tree. Giving the opportunity to choose comfortable seating for independent reading will boost their love of learning and create the healthy mind/healthy body we all desire. The mats will be used for partner reading or lounge reading. The seats will also be used for reading, but will allow students the choice to sit anywhere in the classroom. The backs allow for support, without the need of a wall. In unison, these tools will provide my students the freedom to move about the classroom.","My students need alternative seating choices such as mats, seats and a reading rug.","Health & Sports, Literacy & Language",Grades 3-5,Supplies,441.2,Fully Funded

My students need 10 sets of leveled books. As a child, books were my best friends... my partners in adventure. This is what I want for my students. Unfortunately, they don't have an abundance of high interest, leveled books at their disposal. They must rely on our curriculum or books that were donated to our class library. My goal this year is to be able to provide as much opportunity for my students to fall in love with reading as possible. An inviting and well-stocked classroom library has the capability of turning the most reluctant reader into a book lover. Adding new, high-interest titles will help reach my goal of having a classroom library that my students are excited to explore and fall in love with.

They do several science projects as well as an integrated writing history project. They do an amazing job being resourceful even when they have to share. Often with few books to research we end up researching on the few classroom devices to share, which is often not grade level reading level. We think they deserve a variety of leveled nonfiction books they study as well as more read aloud choices relating to the content. Teachers check books out from the public library for read aloud as well. Students will be able to research at reading levels they can access for all research projects and enjoy read-alouds related to grade level topics to support a rich literacy foundation. They will also have more variety of independent reading choices. We also would like some sturdier bins to keep them organized attractively for students.

The school library is the main library that my students use. My school has Kindergarten through 8th grade. Most of my students come from hard working families that may not be able to afford books at home or have the time to go to the public library. My students are great readers. It is a challenge to keep books in the library for them to read. Funds are limited as in every school. My students want to read the books they see in stores but are unable to purchase. The school library is their way to get to those books. They are well deserving students that are hopefully turning into life long readers. My students absolutely love the 'I Survived' series by Lauren Tarshis. We have them all in paperback and they have been much read and loved to the point where they are beyond taping. I use tape to make them last but it is time to ask for some help in getting hardbacks. I don't see the interest my students have for this series waning as we are anxiously awaiting the next book in the series. They are excellent adventure books with true history facts in the story. My students are improving their reading skills while learning historical facts without even knowing it. The series has also led some of my students to want to read more non-fiction books about the read historical events.

Some of my older elementary and middle school female students are starting to need encouragement and support to play sports. They are at the age where playing sports is sometimes not seen as 'ideal' for a girl. They need to know that playing sports and being active is a good habit for a lifetime. The Jake Maddox Girl Sports Stories series definitely supports the idea of sports being for everyone. When students read about girls in sports and see the books in the library it will help them to know that playing sports is cool. Playing sports does not need to ever end if they enjoy it.

It also might suggest an answer to their personal problem. I have seen kids' eyes light up when they see a book with a character that may look like them.
