The leveled readers we have are very short and most of my readers have already read them multiple times. Chapter books, please! My students are becoming excellent readers. I think that may be my favorite part of this job so far, watching them grow. At this point in the year they have shown so much growth! I cannot let them be held back by our selection of books. It is my job to challenge them, and make sure they have all of the necessary materials to do excellent things with their lives. Some of them have never read chapter books before and that accomplishment alone is something that they are proud of. I want them to excel, be proud of their accomplishments and become amazing readers. Please help me do this for them! The titles that I have requested are from some of my favorite book series from when I was a child. Of course, I added some suggestions from my little ones, but most of you will remember reading these books! The Magic School Bus, Henry and Mudge, Amelia Bedelia, these are just a few of the series that are included in this project. Reading can be fun, and it is especially fun when readers get to follow a character through multiple books. I want to share that fun with my students. My students have been so inspired by the donations that we have received so far from DonorsChoose.org. They even wanted to start their own 'giving tree' bulletin board to track the ways that our class can help others because we have been helped so much. Not only is your funding helping them grow academically but your generosity shows them that there is good in the world, and a lot of it. Thank you for everything that you do.

Many of my students live in neighborhoods where they cant go outside and take a walk and they don't have opportunities to go to a museum. My students are active explorers. I teach prekindergarten in a public school in Washington, DC. My students are always asking inquisitive questions and I know they yearn to understand the world around them but I do not have enough resources in my classroom to teach them everything I would like them to learn. We live in a society where science isn't always the priority but it is a subject matter that I not only want to be a priority in my classroom but I want to make it fun and interesting for my young scientists. The resources I am asking for include a light table and various materials my students can explore with the light table. These resources will help my students learn about how light affects what we see and they can have a clearer picture of how light affects things differently. My project is so important because I am asking for materials that have endless uses in my classroom. A light table can be used to teach my students about science but can also be altered to teach literacy or be used for an art project.

ba4d9406a4977793d971716bb842bf9f,Making Mathematicians Out Of Kinder Kids!,"Math can be challenging and frustrating for young children in Kindergarten. Without interactive tools and games, my students have a hard time visualizing math in the real world. We need the resources to build on students basic number sense and problem solving. I work at a Title 1 School where 70% of our students are free and reduced lunch. They are enthusiastic learners who need the basic fundamentals to succeed in Kindergarten and enrich their love of school. My students are ready for new challenges and enjoy learning. Most of my students have not had the opportunity to work with math manipulative's or played games that facilitate learning. My students come into the school year with little knowledge of what math is, how we use it everyday, and basic number sense. It is my job to get my kindergarten students loving school, so they continue on their path to a higher education. Math can be very frustrating to young students and it is my goal to find games, tools, and resources to encourage students to love math! The resources I have chosen are hands-on, interactive, and promote basic problem solving skills. The use of mathematical stations help each student independently problem solve, work with others to explain their mathematical thinking, and engage the students in game-like centers that promote learning. Puzzles not only promote logical and mathematical reasoning, but also fine motor skills. The writing tablets will help the students write numerals and explain their thinking while developing number formation. The various learning centers will help the students build confidence in explaining their thinking with peers in small groups, and have them show their mathematical knowledge. Students gain information through hands-on learning centers because they are physically manipulating the tools to help them problem solve. Another great advantage is teaching the students how to explain their thinking using math language and build their own oral language among their peers. My students are extremely enthusiastic about math, but it can become frustrating to work through mathematical problems. I need the resources and manipulative's to help my students strengthen their confidence in basic problem solving, explain their thinking, and build their math language. Throughout their education, children must explain their reasoning, and these resources will help students to naturally progress in explaining how they found a solution and how math is important to everyday life!

These are some of the best words I could hear from my students during center time! In wanting their love for books to grow, I want to give them another way to listen and enjoy books! My classroom is a Tittle 1, Head Start Preschool/Pre-K mixed aged classroom. They started as a rambunctious group excited to do anything in school and have grown into deeper learners these last few months. Now that their love for school and learning is growing, I know I need to set them up for success, especially with their pre-literacy and mathematics skills. Finding a way to foster their excitement for learning as well as their social/emotional growth in a play-based environment is my main job! We have so many children wanting an adult to read books to them, it has become challenging to meet all of the student's needs during this critical learning time. With no listening center currently, the children are frustrated when they cannot read the stories on their own. By giving them a way to listen to books in a more independent way, we can allow each child to grow their love for reading. In addition, children will develop their listening skills, their abilities to follow directions (page turning signals), and their social skills by reading with a friend! Looking at the data for the student population in our area is one of the most disheartening things I can do. But it is also the best reminder of why I am doing what I do each day; setting up my students for the best possible educational future!

b8c67cd6680b1d324ed5bbbcb20b8021,Pre-K Listening Center,"One of the biggest determinants of success in their academic career is exposure to fluent reading at an early age. A classroom listening center is the perfect way to provide my students with this opportunity and further develop their emergent reading skills. My students, all either four or five years old, are in Pre-Kindergarten at a public, inner-city school in Washington, DC. They are an energetic, enthusiastic group who are eager to learn. Though they are at different stages in their literary development, they all love and appreciate books and enjoy being read to. I am requesting a complete listening station for the classroom literacy center. This station will include a CD player, set of headphones, junction box and a storage unit to keep things organized (we already have sets of books with corresponding CDs). This listening center will ensure that all 20 students will have access to individual reading instruction, which is critical as they embark on the initial stage of the multi-year process of becoming fluent readers. Exposure to fluent reading on an individual or group basis during morning reading, center time, or free choice will help students gain access to books, recognize letters, make letter-sound connections, recognize site words and aid in comprehension. Furthermore, this will instill my students with a sense of confidence that they are reading the book along with the recorded reader. Additionally, the listening center will foster productive interaction with technology and further develop their fine motor skills. A listening center will be a wonderful addition to the classroom. Your donation to this project will greatly impact the lives of my students and no amount is too small. Each student will have access to the listening center a minimum of 2-3 times per week which will aid in the development of their emergent reading skills.

My students are energetic fourth graders who love when hands on activities can be incorporated into math lessons. I work in a Title I school where many of my students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. My school does not have the funding to buy many extra materials such as math manipulatives for classrooms, so math time can be a challenge for some of my students. My fourth-graders need concrete, hands on practice with different fraction concepts. I am requesting fraction pieces in tile and circle form to help my students visualize fractions in different forms. I am also requesting fraction games to give my students more practice with manipulating fractions. My students are always much more willing to practice math if the math topics are presented as a game! The Common Core State Standards for fourth grade have a strong focus on fractions, including finding equivalence, adding, subtraction, multiplication, and ordering of fractions. These fraction manipulatives will allow my students to easily visualize fraction problems and be more successful at the tasks that they need to accomplish. Math topics build on each other and without a strong base many students struggle in math class. I want my fourth graders to have a strong foundation in math so that they can continue to build their math knowledge and be successful in school.

My middle-school speech kids are predominantly inner city African American males. The stigma of not being able to pronounce sounds correctly has a big impact on their lives. They are reluctant to speak in class, fearing they will be made fun of (and they often are). They have even gotten into fights because of their speech. They work hard in speech therapy, but despite their best efforts, there are a few sounds they struggle to master (especially /s/ and /r/). Cutting edge therapy tools, such as Speech Buddies, will give these kids a chance of conquering their targeted sounds. Speech Buddies are radically different from other articulation tools. They go where the Speech-Language Pathologist can't, directly into the student's mouth, to teach the exact placement of the tongue and lips in order to make sounds correctly. It is my hope that the Speech Buddies will be just the thing to help my students, whom life has not given a fair shake, to sound like their peers and give them the confidence they need to succeed in school.

We live in a rural Idaho community that still values 'vocational' education. My students are interested in learning skills they can use in their daily lives- possibly even for making a living. We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. Students will be mainly using these vices to make me deaf. Okay, not really. Vices are an essential tool in any shop- holding pieces to be cut, pressing bits together, hammering on the anvil, bending, the list could go on for miles. We mainly use these vices in my metals class- where I teach them how to punch holes in metal, set rivets, groove seams, and straighten projects that might have gotten a little off kilter. How will this make a difference? Well, It will let my students DOUBLE their productivity. Instead of 20 students in 2 lines waiting for a vise, I'll have 20 students in 4 lines waiting.

My students are very enthusiastic about learning! We love our charter school in rural Idaho. The atmosphere is very warm and friendly. We are able to work in small groups, right at each student’s level. Our school is known as a 'safe place' for each and every student. We love the diversity and unique perspective of each student. Our discussions are engaging and enriching because we learn from each other. My students have struggles, but they don't let that stop them! Often we make our own supplies or make do with what we can find, but some things are impossible or too time consuming to make. We could really use some help! We like our math class to be hands-on! These counting games and sponges will help us learn about multiplication in a way that is fun and memorable. We also need to learn more about time, so some clocks would be great! These clocks have hands that move like real clocks. They will help us get a grasp on how the hands move as time passes. After we learn, we love sharing! A white 'Write and Wipe' board will be perfect for sharing what we have learned with the class. Finally, we will need some privacy partitions so that students can show how much they know, not how much their neighbor knows, when it comes to test time. With these resources, our classroom will be full of fun learning. When learning is fun, it is meaningful to children, and they are fully engaged! I want my students to love math.

Music crosses borders and turns frowns into smiles.' Dan Rather - CBS NewsI see this in action with my students every day. Won't you help us turn our frowns into smiles? I teach in a Title I second-fifth grade school in Georgia where a high percentage of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch. A large percentage of my students are English as a Second Language learners. My students are amazing, talented, and intelligent children who desire the best education possible. In spite of their home situations, they come to school each and every day ready to learn. They deserve the same music making opportunities as other students in my district. Children love to drum! The sight, the sound, and the feeling are tremendous motivators for students. When played together, drums require students to work together and the payoff is immediate: an energetic, expressive sound. Drums provide unlimited opportunities for experience with rhythm, ensemble playing, movement, improvisation, meter, and timbre. Drumming also provides teachers with the flexibility to assign parts of varying difficulty to players of different abilities. Moreover, the ensembles provide an invaluable social experience because the players depend on each other for the group to succeed. No matter the grade level, drumming is a powerful tool to build teamwork, discipline, and excitement. Through the power of drumming all students have a musical voice and experience music on a deeper level.

I'm hoping to eliminate a lot of the frustrations my students experience in my Tech classes when they use our old robots by updating our set to the new and improved EV3 versions. We live in a rural Idaho community that still values 'vocational' education. My students are interested in learning skills they can use in their daily lives - possibly even for making a living. We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. With these new robots, students will be able to quickly and easily test out programs they've written. Most of the robots we currently use do not have working screens, and several of them have worn ports causing poor connections to motors and sensors. Being able to 'plug and play' will allow them to go further in their experimentation, and not only learn how the sensors work but also see what they see! With this knowledge I hope they will also be able to adapt their programs to compete in a classroom 'challenge' to see whose robot can navigate the maze. Technology changes at the speed of light.

My students are bright and inquisitive. They ask many questions and value quality work. They want to be taught how to be successful and they are working hard on doing that each and every day!

My students are about to start a unit that requires them to learn about plot and how good authors write. I'm requesting quality children's books to use as examples for my students to study. My classes will then transfer what they've learned about the children's books to write their own book. This is the third year that I've done this activity and it's been the single most completed assignment that I do. My students develop their own characters and story line. They create a story for an elementary student that they would like to tell. My students write and illustrate their own children's books. They become authors! Once the books are completed, my students visit the local elementary school and partner with a younger student to share their book. The books are then given to the younger students for their classroom library. This activity builds such confidence in my students and helps them to see that they can make a difference in their world through helping younger students. This project will give my students the confidence to believe that they can do something to help others. This will be another step towards their goal to be successful in 7th grade this year. When my students are able to look outside of themselves and their own wants and needs to help others, they reap many rewards.
