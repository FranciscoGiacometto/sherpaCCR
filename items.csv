43eb0631a7370f7936cd6219ed49721f,Strong Characters Build Strong Readers and Writers,"Have you ever read with a child who would not put that one magical book down? That is how it was for my first graders when I introduced them to the Elephant and Piggie series by Mo Willems. They so love Piggie and her friend Gerald that the characters feel like two more kids in our classroom! I teach at a public alternative school. The literacy workshop curriculum keeps the students active and engaged. Like every primary teacher, my class includes kids who are already reading, as well as kids who are just dipping their feet in the water. It is for this latter group, in particular, that I am requesting a Donors Choose grant. I hope to buy a large set of these magical books that kids won't put down! I hope you'll come on board with me! Beginning readers confidently read what each character is saying because they have learned their personalities and ways of interacting. Pictures of them and their talking balloons have started surfacing in the students' drawings and I have even heard familiar exchanges during the kids' spontaneous drama. I knew we were on to something good, but unfortunately, there are not enough books in the classroom or library to satisfy this thirst. I want to use the Elephant and Piggie books in Readers Theater activities with students to help them build confidence and voice as readers. A larger collection of them can increase their use as take home, read-aloud-to-family books, because they are books these kids are dying to read aloud. When the occasional book is left at home, the other kids will not feel so disappointed. Elephant and Piggie will also contribute to my students' growth as writers, as the kids are already drawing these beloved characters and captioning their conversations with speech bubbles modeled after those in the texts. More copies spread out on the tables will invite them to add words they have memorized, or copy words that express what they want to say. Sight words will serve the greatest purpose (rather than flashcard practice), rounded out with best guess spelling that builds phonics knowledge and fluency with writing. In short, Elephant and Piggie (and the Pigeon) inspire, and inspired readers are fearless readers. Because my children believe in and love the voices of these characters and their friends (yes, there is a snake, a bat, a bird...), they are building their own voices as readers in order to spend time with these characters, and then extending that inspiration in writing. Please help build our collection of these go-to books--and contribute to building our skills as readers and writers!

Being able to love reading can open a person's mind to things they never knew and I believe that every student deserve the opportunity to have that experience. Our school is very diverse, therefore we have many students that come from different backgrounds. We have a lot of military families, low poverty and high poverty, single parent families or no parent families, homeless families, and a big population of Malti-cultural families. Because of this our school is extremely community and family oriented. We want to do everything we can to make sure every student is being included and feels safe and able to learn. One thing I have noticed is either students love to read because they have access to do so, or students hate to read because of their inability to do so. This inability can come from a lack of access to reading materials outside of the classroom. I want students to be able to use the kindles as another way to read books they love. I also would like to use the camera's on the Kindles for projects or QR Code's during in class assignments. I believe that it is important to have technology available at the students fingertips because that is where this generation is headed. My hope is for students to be able to access reading in a different and meaningful way with these Kindles. They will allow students with sight impairments and English Language Learners to read with a font that is best for their needs. Also, English Language Learners will have access to texts in their language and at their level. I whole heartedly believe these will help students that struggle with reading, find a way to not struggle and see the possibilities they have to be great readers.

In order to be successful in this program, students need to have graphing calculators. Please help us be successful! My students are freshmen and sophomores in high school who have struggled in math and never passed a math class. Now that they are in high school, and math is a must in order to graduate, they are struggling as they don't have the foundational math skills to pass a math class. This course is designed to help solidify their basic math skills as well teach them all of the Algebra 1 skills needed at the high school level. These students are with me for two periods in a row (110 minutes) to maximize the content that we cover. Over the course of the year, we will cover foundational math skills from 6th, 7th, and 8th grade, as well as the Algebra 1 skills needed to move onto geometry. Many of the lessons in our curriculum require students to have graphing calculators. These lessons teach the students how to use different components of the graphing calculator. Our school has graphing calculators to use, but they are for students in higher math classes. Many of my students don't have the funds to purchase graphing calculators so teaching these lessons has been a challenge. It would be a huge benefit to my students to be able to learn how to successfully use a graphing calculator, instead of watching my use one under the document camera. My students have lacked confidence in math their entire lives. The curriculum I am teaching from is really helping to provide my students with skills and confidence to go out and be successful.

These are just a few words that describe the Academically Talented students I get to work with each day. These students are excited about learning and would love to have the opportunity to take their learning to the next level with a 3D printer. The seed of a 3D printer and a makerspace was planted by last year's Academically Talented teacher. Now, the 8th grade class, in their last year at the middle school, would like to make a 3D printer a reality in the 5th through 8th grade Academically Talented program. Eager to learn, discover, and create, the students are also excited to be able to design, code, print, and ultimately hold their own ideas in their hands. Before even receiving a 3D printer and just by creating this project, the students are learning about planning and marketing. The students began with researching 3D printers in order to determine the best printer to meet their needs. As they develop this project together, they are also working as a team to market and spread the word about this campaign so that it is successful. Once the students have received this 3D printer and filament, so many more opportunities will be open to them. From learning to code and design their own projects and inventions, to the problem-solving, and persistence required to refine their projects, the students will be able to develop the hands-on learning experiences needed to increase their STEM awareness and 21st Century Skills that are so necessary to their future. Our goal is to make our ideas and projects come to life with a 3D printer. The addition of a 3D printer to the Academically Talented program will allow us to actually apply our learning in real ways, rather than just through discussion or writing. This 3D printer is not only for us, but for all of the current and future students in the program. We are leading this project not only for ourselves, but for the younger AT students as well. We are not only researching and typing up this campaign, but we are planning a media campaign within our school and community to create awareness for our project. This project is important to our school and community because it will provide us and the younger Academically Talented students with a multitude of opportunities that were not available before. We will be able to learn about coding and project design as we become the engineers. And while we, the 8th grade class, will be gone in a year, what we have done for the AT program will not.

Printing simple objects has been interesting, but they are eager to tackle more advanced projects and challenges. They have seen fully, functioning robots using 3D printed parts programmed with controllers like Raspberry Pi 2 and the Arduino Uno R3, and decided this was the next step they wanted to take. Through the combination of our existing 3D printer and the programming capabilities of the Arduino Starter Kits, my students will be able to learn and apply their knowledge of coding to real-world situations. They will be able to work cooperatively as a team, designing and printing the parts needed to construct their robots, and then program their robot to complete a task. According to Eric, 'Our project is to expand our engineering skills and our knowledge of electronics customization by obtaining two Arduino Starter Kits and two Raspberry Pi 2 Starter Kits. Combining our 3D printer with these kits, we can create a balanced, electronics driven curriculum that inspires ingenuity and opens minds to the vast world of robotics, programming, and the creation of objects that can change the world.'

The computers at school are their opportunity to learn how to use changing technology. We use Chromebooks daily for writing in my English classroom for 6-7th grade students. Students utilize Google Classroom and Google apps to enhance their writing experience. They are able to manipulate their papers easily, receive instant feedback from the teacher or a peer, and have a place to keep all of their project materials. It also allows me to post information and extra help that is easily accessible. This technology gives them the ability to easily research and improve on their writing. The extra Chromebooks will ensure that every student has access to their writing daily and is able to utilize the technology completely.

School is their only opportunity to interact with current technology. We are trying to teach our students how to use 21st century technology. This is difficult, though, when we don't have enough computers. With over 40% of our school demographic fitting the profile of 'low income' and 15% of our student population needing Special Education services, our school budget is diminished very quickly, leaving little money for technology. The internet based reading program our Special Education students use encourages them to read more, read faster, and comprehend better while still providing instruction at their learning level. The program itself works great, but we are in short supply of computers to implement the program without having to beg and borrow computers daily from other areas in the school. By having the computers in our room, we are guaranteed access to this beneficial program every day. Even in our current situation, we are seeing gains we might not have seen otherwise.

Their reading levels are diverse as well, ranging from kindergarten through 6th grade. My students are eager to read about this amazing world in which we live. My school is an urban option school that parents can choose for their children. I have many students with special education needs including learning disabilities, Autism-Spectrum Disorder, Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD. These special needs can impact their ability to read at grade-level. My students love reading about their world. They especially enjoy reading books about topics that interest them. It can be frustrating for kids who aren't yet reading higher-level texts, however, because they want to be able to read about their interests, too. Our classroom library just doesn't have enough books at the lower levels these kids need. The collection of books I am requesting includes informational books about topics of high interest to 2nd and 3rd graders. While high-interest, the books are at a lower reading level so they can be accessed by all students. My students will use these books during our daily Reading Workshop. The sets will be used for guided reading when the students will receive reading support in a small group from a teacher. The other books will be used during independent reading time so children can read about topics that interest them. Students will gain confidence as readers as they learn about this wondrous world we live in. These nonfiction books will help them be engaged and excited about reading!

My students come from a variety of backgrounds. Some of my students have the latest technology at home, while others see the latest technology in the classroom. The students at my school have a love for learning and a great deal of creativity. They are very active, and they are always ready for an opportunity to show their 'colors'. As a teacher at an arts infused school, it allows me to engage and motivate students by emphasizing active learning rather than passive learning. I have found it to be easier to level the playing field for my children so they all have the opportunity to be successful! My students need a rug to gather on when we do read alouds and/or small group lessons. My students will easily move to the rug in an organized fashion and have a specific space to sit when we share read alouds and do small group activities. The students will love having an area to come to when we sit on the floor. I chose a rug with the map of the United States of America because we are always looking at the map to see where places are when we are making connections in stories.

I am very excited about the dream I have for the students I am working with this year!Our school has found a web site that compliments our science curriculum wonderfully and 'hooks' our students through the world of mysteries! On MysteryScience, every lesson begins with a mystery and then uses captivating videos and images, combined with discussion opportunities and hands-on activities, to fully immerse our students in the science content we teach. Right now, many of our teachers are using this site through free trial memberships. We would like to request support to continue our membership so we have the wonderful opportunity to continue to engage our students through this site! The introductory mystery, videos, and hands-on activities enable our students to engage in three-dimensional learning that is key to successful implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards and allows our students to feel the excitement and real-world applications of the science content we teach at each level. A school membership will allow all of our students, kindergarten through fourth grade, age-appropriate and content-appropriate lessons that excite our teachers and students alike!

Two or three kids get to be cozy in our classroom library, but the remaining children have to sit on the floor or at their tables. Bean bags and wobble cushions will allow more kids to have comfortable spots for reading. And when they feel comfortable, they will be more focused readers! In addition, when small groups meet with me for individualized instruction, they will no longer have to gather around me on the floor. Instead, they will have stools on which to sit.

Despite some of the challenges they may face, our students are ambitious. Their ambitions will come to fruition if we give them the tools they need to be successful in the classroom. My students are immensely active. I hope to increase their success by supporting them with in classroom environment that embraces their unique learning styles and provides them with outlets to express their diverse needs. As active learners, a traditional classroom setup can inhibit their ability to reach their potential. My dream is to provide my students with a fully functional classroom composed of flexible-seating choices. However, as a new teacher, setting up a classroom with diverse choices can become costly. Flexible seating options will ensure that those students who need a little room to move will surpass expectations. Wobble stools provide wiggle room at desks so that students can move while sitting. Stability balls are a favorite among my learners as they can be physically moving without causing tremendous distraction to other students. My students are learning the regions of the United States; the amazing carpet will help their ability to grasp the geography of the U.S. by increased exposure to the map (even during carpet time). The carpet is also a bonus seating area in which the lap desks will be implemented.
