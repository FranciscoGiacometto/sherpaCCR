These DNA models help overcome that obstacle. I work at a high needs school in an inner city in Missouri. Our school caters to children whose families are seeking asylum from religious or political persecution in their homeland. I work primarily with English Language Learners and the use of visuals are imperative to teaching them not only science, but English as well. DNA is a type of macromolecule known as a nucleic acid. It is shaped like a twisted double helix and is composed of long strands of alternating sugars and phosphate groups, as well as nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine). DNA controls cellular activity by coding for the production of enzymes and proteins. The information in DNA is not directly converted into proteins, but must first be copied into RNA in a process called transcription. These models allow students to break down complex processes into steps as well as engage the learners through a hands-on approach to science education. Constructing DNA models is a great way to learn about DNA structure, function, and replication. DNA models are representations of the structure of DNA.

Three calculators available for students to check out to complete their homework and prepare for the SAT will help out immeasurably! My students are some of the hardest working in San Diego. They have aspirations to attend college and higher level math classes will help them achieve this goal. Please help my students get calculators to use in their math classes. In our school, our students are: 40% immigrants and refugees, 63% English language learners, 100% eligible for free and reduced lunch, 100% hardworking, resilient, and diligent. The students are in one of the most diverse areas of the United States. Students come from Africa, Vietnam, Mexico, Burma, and many other countries. The students stand proud as new Americans and value the opportunity to get an education. Many of these students will be first in their family to attend college, the first to graduate high school, and they are taking Calculus! 120 students are prepared to take Calculus this year. Many of my students have had very little experience using technology, let alone graphing calculators. Imagine being confused in your math class, the teacher describes how it works, but you just can't imagine. Then you punch a few buttons on the calculator and, voila, everything makes sense. Calculators are essential for success in Calculus. Additionally, students will be gaining skills using the graphing calculators that will be important for success when taking the SAT. Calculus is impossible to understand without calculators. Access to this basic technology will dramatically improve success for these young people. Your support will create a new pathway for success for our students. A calculator can make a huge difference in learning.

The leveled readers we have are very short and most of my readers have already read them multiple times. Chapter books, please! My students are becoming excellent readers. I think that may be my favorite part of this job so far, watching them grow. At this point in the year they have shown so much growth! I cannot let them be held back by our selection of books. It is my job to challenge them, and make sure they have all of the necessary materials to do excellent things with their lives. Some of them have never read chapter books before and that accomplishment alone is something that they are proud of. I want them to excel, be proud of their accomplishments and become amazing readers. Please help me do this for them! The titles that I have requested are from some of my favorite book series from when I was a child. Of course, I added some suggestions from my little ones, but most of you will remember reading these books! The Magic School Bus, Henry and Mudge, Amelia Bedelia, these are just a few of the series that are included in this project. Reading can be fun, and it is especially fun when readers get to follow a character through multiple books. I want to share that fun with my students. My students have been so inspired by the donations that we have received so far from DonorsChoose.org. They even wanted to start their own 'giving tree' bulletin board to track the ways that our class can help others because we have been helped so much.

For those of us who have had the opportunity to go to college, it is clear to see the impact made by that experience. Too many of our students do not see themselves in college, and may never decide to try if they are not exposed to a college campus now. My students live in urban Los Angeles. The majority of my students come from low income families. They rarely get opportunities such as this one, to be able to visit a college campus, and to see a live collegiate sporting event. Our students may not even realize that at many colleges, extracurricular activities, such as sporting events can be such a large part of the college experience. We are requesting one bus for 6 hours in order to transport our students to the UCLA 'I'm Going to College' event. We have already secured 50 donated tickets for our students to attend the UCLA Track and Field meet, as well as the college fair and campus tour activities hosted by UCLA during the event. We would like to offer this trip to our students as a reward for their excellent attendance all year. We have held excellent attendance as a major goal for our students this year. Attendance in school is the most important factor that will determine whether students will pass their classes this year, and eventually graduate from High School.

I teach robotics and physics at an all-girl public school with a focus on science. Many students have no concept of careers in science and this is a great way to open their eyes to engineering in an exciting hands-on manner. Students will learn to program small robots using the netbook. This class is a pre-engineering class for young ladies that have some interest in technology. College requirements for technical fields, such as: 'experience in computer programming', and others, are met by taking this class, and using the technology you are helping make available. The robot kits are already in the classroom. We now need the technology (netbook) to use the software, learn and write programs, and communicate with the robots. The students will be tasked with using sensors on their robots, and programming the robots to go through a maze, autonomously, using these sensors. The classroom is divided in eight teams. Students will gain excellent preparation for engineering careers and information technology. This is a great means to boost students' confidence about their success in technical fields.

All year, we have studied the benefits of attending college and the process of getting in. But nothing inspires students like seeing actual colleges in person. If we receive the funding we need, I will take my students on a college trip to Washington, D.C, where we'll visit five colleges representing a wide array of possible experiences (public vs. private, large vs. small, urban vs. suburban vs. rural, etc.). We will spend an entire day at each college - we'll attend an information session, take a campus tour, and visit cultural centers so that my students meet and relate to real college students. My students will have researched each college in advance and prepared a full packet of questions, and they'll take notes throughout the day to ensure that they will fully retain what they learn. During the evenings, we will visit historical and governmental landmarks so that my students can be fully immersed in this amazing city.

I work at a Title 1 School where 70% of our students are free and reduced lunch. They are enthusiastic learners who need the basic fundamentals to succeed in Kindergarten and enrich their love of school. My students are ready for new challenges and enjoy learning. Most of my students have not had the opportunity to work with math manipulative's or played games that facilitate learning. My students come into the school year with little knowledge of what math is, how we use it everyday, and basic number sense. It is my job to get my kindergarten students loving school, so they continue on their path to a higher education. Math can be very frustrating to young students and it is my goal to find games, tools, and resources to encourage students to love math! The resources I have chosen are hands-on, interactive, and promote basic problem solving skills. The use of mathematical stations help each student independently problem solve, work with others to explain their mathematical thinking, and engage the students in game-like centers that promote learning. Puzzles not only promote logical and mathematical reasoning, but also fine motor skills. The writing tablets will help the students write numerals and explain their thinking while developing number formation. The various learning centers will help the students build confidence in explaining their thinking with peers in small groups, and have them show their mathematical knowledge. Students gain information through hands-on learning centers because they are physically manipulating the tools to help them problem solve. Another great advantage is teaching the students how to explain their thinking using math language and build their own oral language among their peers. My students are extremely enthusiastic about math, but it can become frustrating to work through mathematical problems. I need the resources and manipulative's to help my students strengthen their confidence in basic problem solving, explain their thinking, and build their math language. Throughout their education, children must explain their reasoning, and these resources will help students to naturally progress in explaining how they found a solution and how math is important to everyday life!

My classroom is a Tittle 1, Head Start Preschool/Pre-K mixed aged classroom. They started as a rambunctious group excited to do anything in school and have grown into deeper learners these last few months. Now that their love for school and learning is growing, I know I need to set them up for success, especially with their pre-literacy and mathematics skills. Finding a way to foster their excitement for learning as well as their social/emotional growth in a play-based environment is my main job! We have so many children wanting an adult to read books to them, it has become challenging to meet all of the student's needs during this critical learning time. With no listening center currently, the children are frustrated when they cannot read the stories on their own. By giving them a way to listen to books in a more independent way, we can allow each child to grow their love for reading. In addition, children will develop their listening skills, their abilities to follow directions (page turning signals), and their social skills by reading with a friend! Looking at the data for the student population in our area is one of the most disheartening things I can do. But it is also the best reminder of why I am doing what I do each day; setting up my students for the best possible educational future!

Every day I am constantly amazed by their resiliency to obstacles and the extremes they will go to in order to succeed. I know they are on pace to great things. The most heartbreaking part of teaching has come the Monday after ACT Test Saturdays. My students come back and tell me about all the problems they knew how to perform and yet could not because they didn't have the calculators the problems required. Their scores are lower not because they don't know as much as other students but simply because they do not have the resources other students do. Too many of my students have been admitted to fine universities with their admission deferred unless they can get their ACT scores higher. My students have lowered the barrier between themselves and their dreams. Help them make the final jump. Donations to this cause will be used to buy calculators to be used on the ACT.

My students live in a small town. They are wonderful kids that are always full of energy. They always keep me on my toes and I love it. Our school is the newest building in the district, but despite the new walls and floors, we have some very dated reading materials. One of the copyrights on my text books is 1991. Because of the dated images, students often think there is nothing 'good' to be found in the text book which sends me on a quest for newer material to keep their interest levels up. These books that I've requested will help to teach a variety of literary elements in a non-threatening way. Most of the stories are historical fiction which allows me to pair a non-fiction text with the historical fiction story. The idea is to get text-to-text connections between the historical and non-fiction. As a result of high-stakes testing, students have been taught very little History and Science in the past several years. It's a disservice to our students. I hope to remedy at least part of that while incorporating my own subject area (ELA).

This station will include a CD player, set of headphones, junction box and a storage unit to keep things organized (we already have sets of books with corresponding CDs). This listening center will ensure that all 20 students will have access to individual reading instruction, which is critical as they embark on the initial stage of the multi-year process of becoming fluent readers. Exposure to fluent reading on an individual or group basis during morning reading, center time, or free choice will help students gain access to books, recognize letters, make letter-sound connections, recognize site words and aid in comprehension. Furthermore, this will instill my students with a sense of confidence that they are reading the book along with the recorded reader. Additionally, the listening center will foster productive interaction with technology and further develop their fine motor skills. A listening center will be a wonderful addition to the classroom.

Bamboo Pen Tablets will allow my students to produce drawings and diagrams of their ideas digitally then display them on their ePortfolio websites. These devices will be used to construct sketches and plans in our STEM Engineering class. Fewer students in the United States are pursuing careers in engineering. This concerns me because engineers are the designers and innovators in our society. If we want to strengthen our economy we need to invest in our future and inspire students toward careers in engineering design. The new common core Next Generation Science Standards emphasize engineering and design thinking. This is an important shift in education from standardized teaching toward problem based learning. In response, I have created an engineering class which focuses on design thinking and problem solving. It is very exciting for our school, which is in Central California. We are a low income community and many students are disadvantaged financially. Many of my students have never been out of the city. They do not have many opportunities. This year has been the hardest for us. Our district is facing big budget cuts. Our spending has been frozen and reduced, which is why I am seeking funding outside of the school. The new Common Core is inspiring a shift from a focus on 'correct answers' to developing student ideas. Students come to the classroom with an entire belief system in their heads. It's important for teachers to find out what students think, uncover any misconceptions in that thinking, then challenge those misconceptions with activities and projects. An important piece in this strategy is to ask students to create explanations of their thinking. One way students do this is by drawing diagrams and writing about how systems like the carbon cycle work. With Bamboo tablets, students will be able to draw these diagrams on the computer and post them to their ePortfolio websites. Posting their work publicly on the web gives students more accountability for their learning. Also, students will use these devices to do art and 3D CAD design. This will allow us to move away from using paper which is more earth-friendly. And student work will be online for parents and the public to view! Newspapers tell us we have many high tech jobs available in the US but we don't have the skilled employees to fill them. Students do not have the thinking and collaborative skills that industry wants. I've created an elective class to focus students on these skills.

They also allow students to add their own circuits, and write control programs for what they create. Our students are like the field in the picture, mature and ready to harvest...to add their minds to the storehouse of knowledge. But it takes special tools and effort to reap that harvest. We are a lower middle class school. For those of you who understand what it means, 51% of our students qualify for the free lunch program. In spite of this we are not in a low enough income bracket to get much special government funding. Many of my students are bright enough to attend college, but the reality is that many will need to get jobs to support themselves and their families as soon as they graduate. It takes a lot of vision and commitment for that type of student to put in the extra effort to add additional education or trade school to their after High School schedule. We work on vision casting. We try to instill a dream that stays with them and motivates them well after High School so they will make a brighter future for themselves. BoeBots are not toys. We have one of the Lego Mindstorms kits, and it has many great features, but the reason we use the BoeBot platform is that it uses industry standard parts and programming. Students learn Basic and C++, languages that translate into jobs after they leave us. I can introduce you to industry partners that use the Basic Stamp (the micro controller that powers the BoeBot), to design and build their real world products.

Our students are individuals who couldn't find public school supportive enough to fulfill their educational needs and wants. They are creative, talented, and each bring their own unique background experience to the table. For some, this school brings the only structure and positive social interaction they have in life. For others, it was an alternative from dropping out of school because of bad life choices, or the failure to reach the demanding requirements in order to graduate in the normal time span. Our school is set in a rural community and draws in students from the surrounding counties. This allows our students to interact with different peers, normally unknown if attended public schools in an environment were being 'different' is 'normal'. My goal is show these students not to limit themselves based on their expectations, but learn to reach beyond mine. The resources we are requesting are essential for us to build underwater ROVs. The STEM curriculum is integrated into our science classes, giving the students a more hands-on, meaningful experience. The students learn such things as buoyancy, underwater biology, wiring, design, and much more. The objective with each project is then to compete with other schools (private, public, and alternative) around the state to test our innovative designs and theories. Having the materials will help us reach more students who respond more to hands-on learning verses kill and drill traditional learning. By building these ROVs, students are learning more about careers in engineering, robotics, natural resources, wiring, and architectural design. This is our first year doing the underwater ROVs, and we hope to start a friendly rival with the IVD team at our school who have won awards for their electric car designs. The donations to this request will make such a huge positive difference, first, by showing our students that there are people in the world that do care about their education; second, by providing unique experiences at our school that the local public schools don't provide.

We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past four years, our small initiative has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. This calendar year, a small group of students will be traveling through Spain and Portugal. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the religious influences on art and literature, strengthen their Spanish speaking skills by volunteering with a community center, and compare the traditions, cultures, and cuisine to what they are accustomed to. They will be part of nightly conversations that ask them to reflect on the experience in the moment. Much of their experience will be captured in nightly journals that will be collected. These will assist with their research upon returning. In funding this grant, you give another student the opportunity to travel with us. The total cost covers everything for the student, including transportation, meals, and all activity costs. The research, experience, and life long lessons that are produced from these tours are true testaments to the value of this program.

Some things are too important to just wish for, which is why I am turning to Donors Choose to get these supplies. We are a rural school district in Central Washington. All three schools are on a single campus, with about four hundred students at the high school. A lot of the students' parents are field laborers with limited proficiency in English. Approximately 80% of our students are Mexican. The vast majority of the students appreciate the value of a good education and work to take advantage of what is being offered to them. With these kits, my students will be able to construct working motors. Reading about how motors work is a poor substitute for actually making a motor from start to finish and watching it spin. Without these kits, electric motors will be nothing other than a bunch of abstract vocabulary. With these motors kits, students will learn the fundamental principles behind a number of devices that are used on a regular basis, such as fans, blenders, and vacuum cleaners, just to name a few. They will learn how some wires and electricity can be used to make practical devices that we rely on every day. It's important for students to have engineering experiences as well as science experiences. I think that engineering is grossly neglected in secondary education. Yes, science is important and paves the way for many engineering advances, but pure science doesn't bring improvements into our lives--engineering does.

They are mixed in some classrooms which makes for a very diverse classroom body. I am requesting an LCD projector so all of my students can enjoy the luxury of being able to observe a PowerPoint presentation or a clip from a movie and even something as simple as a biological animation without 25 students huddled around a computer monitor. My project is so important because historically learning biology was difficult as students had to visualize so much of what was read in their own head. With so much information and visual aids available on the Internet today we can more thoroughly teach and reach more children than ever before.

STEM is a concept that is brewing in our county. These STEM kits will be able to jump start the students knowledge on alternative energies. Alternative energy is a highly publicized topic of conversation and students need to have a firm foundational understanding of alternative energy. Science should be learned by doing science and not by having to learn solely from websites and outdated textbooks.

Class sizes vary from 15-26 depending on the grade level. Currently they are in a class of 16. They are all eager to learn new things. Like all third graders, they enjoy playing games. They are a very close group who support and encourage each other. Most of them have attended the same school since PK. I am requesting board games to help with difficult concepts in reading. I have found that my students struggle with things like main idea. I chose sets of bingo and literacy games that I could use as a whole class or small group activity to help the students make meaningful and engaging connections to the concepts that they struggle with. I also requested math games and books that will help introduce new topics and give students hands on engagement with the new ideas. I also chose a set of timers to help assist in game play and keeping up with transition times between centers or games. Donations to my request will make a huge impact in my students' day to day learning experiences. I am a first year teacher who has few resources outside of the traditional textbook.

Now, we need to finish equipping our shop to make our students competitive with those from more affluent schools. The drill press will be one of the hardest working tools in the shop. The 3,339 mostly (91%) Latino students in grades 9 through 12 attend our school at the southern tip of the city of Los Angeles. Surrounded by several refineries and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the school serves a blue-collar, working class community with a substantially (70%) economically-disadvantaged population. The majority of our parents work for these industries and others in the Los Angeles industrial harbor vicinity. Our Robotics Team is made up of general and special ed students who are interested in design, engineering, and manufacturing. Before joining the team, many of them didn't know what type of work engineers do. After experiencing Robotics competitions, many of them want to become engineers. Each year in the FIRST Robotics Competition, students have six weeks to design and build a robot to compete in FRC's 'Varsity Sport for the Mind', a 3-on-3 high-energy robot sporting event. Students participate in a range of experiences they would otherwise be unlikely to experience. They communicate with local business representatives, develop and lead squads within the larger team to accomplish specific tasks, design parts and systems, produce digital renderings, solve difficult problems, and program computer micro-controllers. This intense event is made even more valuable when students have the equipment and materials available to properly fabricate parts. Students learn skills that are applicable to a wide range of jobs and careers. The safe and successful operation of machinery plays no small role in that experience. We are requesting a floor drill press that will serve our team for many years. Students will learn valuable job and craft skills. Our students are best served by being exposed to multiple career options and by learning skills that will serve them in many jobs. The U.S. needs more students with practical skills and experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Robotics serves this function beautifully. All of our students learn skills and practices that range from machine operation to project management. Few high school programs provide such rich learning experiences.

Many of my students do not have access to iPad's at home. We have students from many different cultures and countries (Mexico, Nepal, Burma, and India). Many of our students are refugees from refugee camps in their native country. Picture it...students having the latest technology in their hands for usage in the classroom.

Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

My students face challenges communicating and learning, but you can help. We are in need of basic classroom supplies to make picture supported materials for learning and communication opportunities. I am a Speech Language Pathologist in an inner city, high-need district. Our district is large (34 schools) and our needs are great. I provide direct therapy services to 25 students in 3 classrooms in our Autism program. The students in this program are challenged daily to communicate and interact with others. They have a wide range of communication skills and benefit from the use of visual supports when communicating and learning. Many of these students are non-verbal or have limited verbal skills and need speech generating devices to support their communication. This project will ensure that we will start the school year with a supply of materials to make the picture supports my students need to communicate and learn. The ink cartridges will be used to print pictures for communication books and to adapt materials for lessons and learning. The laminating pouches will make the pictures durable and last for the year. The glue sticks and velcro will be used to attach the pictures to many different surfaces in our room. Binders, sheet protectors, and file folders will be used for new communication books. We will use the construction paper, sentence strips and markers for adapted literacy lessons. These materials are crucial supplies in our classrooms and your funding will ensure that we have the necessary supplies to support the learning and communication needs of our students efficiently.

456a94e474debad17ade6ea2486faa74,Strengthen Those Hands,"Do you remember playing with Lego's, creating crafts, using Lincoln Logs, and spending the day using your hands? Unfortunately many children go through their early years without these crucial experiences that provide them with the prerequisite fine motor skills for school and academic success. I teach in a rural district in Colorado. Over half of the elementary school's population qualify for free and reduced lunches. The district is also low on funds as is true of most schools in our country which makes it difficult to stay current with new technology. There is a large ELL population within the school district as well. Students are eager to learn and becoming even more excited and engaged when technology is involved. Within the low-income population many students go through the early years without the experiences and practice to build foundational skills. Students are lacking these skills and in turn face many obstacles and struggles in today's rigorous classroom designs. The materials in this project include beads and laces, lacing boards, tweezers, scoop scissors, and boards where they are required to buckle, snap, lace, and tie. Students will be able to use these manipulative materials to not only gain fine motor strength but will build their manual dexterity as well. These are essential foundational skills that lead to success in the academic classroom. Students need to be able to use these muscles in their hands to complete a wide variety of tasks in the classroom. Most importantly, students need to be able to use these muscles effectively when writing. The act of stringing beads, lacing strings, fastening buckles, and using materials such as tweezers specifically target the small muscles needed to write. With the new rigorous curriculum designs being implemented in schools, students who are unable to use those muscles face many struggles. Students that have missed out on the experiences of using their hands before coming to school are in desperate need of early intervention. Being able to provide students with activities such as lacing beads, fastening buckles, tying laces, along with many others is crucial. Students who lack these skills not only struggle to use supplies such as scissors and crayons, but it is extremely cumbersome to work a pencil. Creating these experiences early is crucial to their success.

Our school is labeled a Title I school because the majority of our students live at or below the poverty level. Although my students deal with many hardships, they view school as a safe haven and come daily excited about what the day may hold. My students need basic school supplies such as crayons, pencils, markers, paper, pencil sharpeners, pencil boxes and other basic supplies to start the new school year. Our students deal with outside factors that tell them that education in not important, such as going to school without any supplies or not being encouraged to do their homework. I believe that providing them with basic supplies will not only encourage them to do their work, but it will also show them the importance of school because it proves that someone thinks enough about their education to provide them with what they need.

7182cb0ab622f059df9369b70c8f8089,The Art of Learning Language Arts in Kindergarten,"Benjamin Franklin said, 'Tell a student and they forget. Show a student and they will remember. Involve a student and they will LEARN.' This is my philosophy as well. Modern research confirms it. Our school has about 450 students. The majority of them, sixty-two percent, are disadvantaged. We also have students from middle to low middle income families. We have students from several ethnic backgrounds including Hispanic, African American, Native American, and Russian. Many of our students are from broken homes, one-parent families, and foster homes. Many of our grandparents are raising their grandchildren with no extra income provided. In some cases, both parents work and grandparents babysit to help out. We have students in need of food, clothing and toys that our school and other community organizations provide during the holidays and throughout the year when needed. Due to economic difficulties, two and three generations of families are living in the same house. The requested resources will help students use many of their senses to learn (touch, sound, sight). Whether a student is a visual, auditory, or kinetic learner, these resources will reinforce their way of learning. I especially like the letter sound blocks that can actually sound out the letters to make words. This will be a great asset when teaching students to blend the sounds to make words. With writing being a big component in the Common Core standards that schools are now using, the informational text materials will enable students to learn to write complete sentences about real things. All these resources are geared to reinforce our language arts curriculum and allow students to work in cooperative groups, in small groups led by the teacher, or individually, based on the students ability. Naturally, it is our goal as teachers to get the students to the point where they can use these resources and work independently with confidence. Students no longer just use books, paper and pencils to learn. Research has shown how hands-on learning will improve the students' chances to learn and succeed in the classroom. Since most of my students have no access to these learning tools at home, being able to offer these in the classroom will not only give them the opportunity to be involved in their own learning, but, it will enable them to have a better chance to succeed. Involve them and they will learn. ","My students need language arts supplies, games, puzzles, and other manipulatives.

In our music classes, we introduce composing using computers. Despite some having limited experience with music instruction, students don't balk at trying this new concept, and embrace it with enthusiasm. My students need 12 midi keyboards for our composing classes. My students have been entering notes in the Finale program, by clicking on each individual staff line or space to place the notes. This is difficult enough with a mouse, but we are using laptops, making it even trickier. With the purchase of these midi keyboards, students will be able to plug them in and play the note they wish to place instead. This will not only speed up their composing process, but will help them to learn the location of notes on a piano keyboard as well.

Although challenged by the environment outside of the school, my students work hard and try to make the most of their opportunity being at our school. They are great kids who are a joy to teach. One of my biggest concerns as a teacher is how can I help my students to be great writers. A document camera would help. I believe modeling is one of the most effective methods to teach students. I can walk them through the writing process all together with a document camera. Students can watch me write as the writing is projected onto the screen. Even better, the students themselves can demonstrate their writing skills by having their writing projected on the screen with the document camera. Students who have done a great job on an essay can have their essay be shown to the class for positive reinforcement and as a positive example. We can revise each other's writing together using the document camera. With this tool, it can make writing a cooperative and interactive activity in our classroom. It is no secret that writing is a problem for many high school students, and especially for those in urban settings. With a document camera, students will have a chance to more easily see good writing, without having to waste tons of paper making copies, and will want to get engaged in the writing process.

They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. A dedicated group of students will be traveling through the United Kingdom. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the economic structure of an international superpower, compare the education system with that of our own, and strengthen their interview and public speaking skills by shadowing employers.

Once the 'chest' is open, students are touched with the treasure of reading. Reading holds the key to students success! Most of my students come from homes that are underprivileged. They have limited access to books outside of school. Most of their engagement with texts happens in the classroom or the school library. Our school is home to a population of 93% children of poverty. Even though most of my students face hardship, they come to school excited about learning, especially reading. With the resources I've requested, my students will be interacting in reading literacy centers. I've requested grade level book sets to have my students engage in book groups. This opportunity would allow them to discuss books as a group and learn together. I've also requested some picture books to read aloud to my students. We will use these texts to show how authors use writing in powerful ways, practice reading comprehension skills, and use before, during, and after reading strategies. With these powerful tools, my students' reading comprehension and enjoyment will increase. I hope to see a positive boost in reading success levels with the use of these resources. This project is immensely crucial to impact student learning. I believe in exposing children to great literature and to use authors as supplemental teachers in my classroom.

My students need some extra room to store our athletic supplies for our new sports teams, and these shelves will give us a lot of space to work with. I work in a low-income (Title One) school in South Tucson. This previous year was our first year having our own sports program, and it is expanding exponentially in the upcoming school year. For many of these kids, our sports programs are their primary extracurricular activity and is certainly helpful in keeping them out of trouble and off the streets. These shelves are not a direct boon to the students learning specifically. What these shelves will allow us to do is create a specific space for the sporting goods that we will use for our teams: uniforms, equipment, and miscellaneous things (like coolers) that will be used to support our sports program. Without being able to have room to store our equipment and to keep it organized, we will inevitably discover that we are short of resources, as has happened in our previous year. This way, we will be able to keep track of how much we have and what we need, keeping our resources more tightly controlled. This sports program is really a big factor for our students. We have had a tremendous amount of interest by the students, and we need to be able to have an organized, secure space that will allow us to keep our equipment ready for the upcoming sports seasons. This will make the organization of the sport easier for the school, allowing us to get right into the business of playing and learning each one in its season this year.

Although it was filled with graphics and colorful pictures, often it was hard to read and comprehend. With your help, my students won't have to experience frustration reading nonfiction text. I am starting a new adventure with a new district and a new campus! The campus I will be attending is a Title 1 school. This means that most of the students I will be serving will come from low socioeconomic environments that face many challenges. The school serves about 900 students and 85 percent are on free/reduced lunch. We also have a large number of refugees that attend our school. Most of my students face academic challenges due to their backgrounds and home lives. Among these challenges are dyslexia, slow-learners, learning disabilities, and language. However, I will also have students who are on and above grade-level that would benefit from this enrichment. I am determined to meet the needs of ALL my students. For many decades, reading and writing has mostly been composed of make believe; fairytales, talking animals, and magic. Students find themselves addicted to these types of text as well as movies. They rarely run to the nonfiction section of the library. It is important that I teach my students the importance of factual information and how to summarize and decide what's important. Although my students are in 3rd grade I want them to be college ready! Being able to comprehend informational and expository text is a must-have skill for college and for life. The Research and Respond Comprehension center will allow my students to increase their comprehension skills with 3 easy steps: preview, read, and respond. After these steps they are required to respond to follow-up questions that reinforce the content. My students will be exposed to high-interest text that I'm sure they will love to read! Maybe they'll even explore the nonfiction section of the library! Research shows that although students are reading on an average of 25 minutes a day, only 4-5 minutes are allocated to nonfiction. (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010) With your help, I believe we can change how students feel about nonfiction. These products will expose my students to high- interest text that will captivate and get their attention.

Some with backpacks full of new pencils, notebooks, tissues, and folders. Others walk into school empty handed. A few materials will trickle in over the next week, but generally students either have them or not. My 4th grade class has 30 students. We are located in an urban district in New York. I have a goal that my students will become a community of learners and help each other grow. It is a beautiful system that allows for students of all academic levels to learn at their instructional level. I am trying to encourage thinking and exploration as a part of learning. I use hands-on practice to explore concepts and encourage team work. Teaching students at all of their diverse levels is a challenge, but it helps each of them to grow to their potential. The students work in partners and small groups regularly, and students really work together to help each other be successful. My students come from a variety of home situations, so they are learning academic and social skills during all subjects. The basic school supplies that I have requested will be used for the students that come to school empty handed. These students are generally from unstable homes, so they aren't able to get them from their parents. When these boys and girls walk into the classroom, I just want them to feel loved, accepted, and eager to learn. So, I usually end up buying supplies for about half of my class, which can become very costly. This allows for me to teach students organization from the first day of school. It also allows for us to get started right away. We are able to set up a good routine from the beginning of the year, and we don't have to wait until all supplies are in. We also pool our supplies together as a class. Each student can use the notebooks and folders that they bring in, but things like pencils, glue sticks, post-it notes, etc. go into shared bins. If we only get these supplies from half of the class, then we run out halfway through the year and I purchase refills. You will make a HUGE difference, even though the supplies requested seem so basic. These supplies will be used to help our class work from the first day of school, all the way to the end of the year. Your donation will ease the mind of a 9 year old who knows that his mom can't afford supplies, and he feels guilty even asking.

My school does not have the funding to buy many extra materials such as math manipulatives for classrooms, so math time can be a challenge for some of my students. My fourth-graders need concrete, hands on practice with different fraction concepts. I am requesting fraction pieces in tile and circle form to help my students visualize fractions in different forms. I am also requesting fraction games to give my students more practice with manipulating fractions. My students are always much more willing to practice math if the math topics are presented as a game! The Common Core State Standards for fourth grade have a strong focus on fractions, including finding equivalence, adding, subtraction, multiplication, and ordering of fractions. These fraction manipulatives will allow my students to easily visualize fraction problems and be more successful at the tasks that they need to accomplish. Math topics build on each other and without a strong base many students struggle in math class.

These amazing students deserve a chance to experience reading and have a love of books. We are a Title I school, but that does not stop the children from being the best they can be and giving it their all in the classroom. Having a rug in the reading area of the classroom will provide a comfortable and inviting space where students will want to open up a book. Students are more likely to focus on what they are reading if they feel comfortable. Indulging in reading will help increase their vocabulary, which is crucial for ELL's. It will also benefit their analytical thinking, writing skills, and hopefully instill in them the value of being life-long learners and readers. I have tried my best to create a classroom that every student in the world deserves. I know my classroom is an inviting place where students feel welcome, but the last piece of the puzzle that is missing is a rug to relax on and open up a book. I want all of my students to have a love for books, and I feel a rug to read on will help create an environment in which this can happen.

Or perhaps, wanted to show something enhanced right away? As a teacher, this is our life- to share! Both my eighth graders and myself are eager to share everything we learn and know with our class. A document camera will enable us to do so. I teach in a Title One, diverse, multi-cultural school. With over 29 languages represented on our campus, we need all the tools we can use to communicate with our students. My eighth graders love math and technology, and luckily math is a universal language. Our school is in a low socioeconomic neighborhood but full of eager, creative learners. In our district, our goal is to have all children excelling and to be college and career ready. We follow the common core standards to ensure that all students are getting the same quality education. My students get so excited when we are able to experience new learning through our smart boards, graphing calculators, laptop carts, and responders; however, we have needs that a document camera would fulfill. With the document camera, my students will have greater opportunities to share their work and discoveries, and learn in a more dynamic way! This will lead to greater listening and work skills. With this, they can share in a positive, encouraging manner. They will be able to use and display math manipulatives under the camera to explain thinking, as well as share their work and steps. Our school is big on STEM teaching in our classrooms, which allows more investigative exploration of topics. As a teacher, I would be able to model more efficiently to the class as a whole. This will also save A LOT of time, for documents not available for the smart board to view, will be able to be shown and not needed to be copied onto a whiteboard. Picture your child in a classroom with a document camera, would you not feel more confident in the learning taking place verses not having a document camera? They truly do help speed up the learning process, while making the learning more engaging and fun! Technology is the future! This will give our students another opportunity to be challenged and to express their ideas and thinking in a different, functional way. It is a more efficient way for me to model, to demonstrate, to display my graphing calculator to teach steps, and to show each other'ÂÂs work, which will enhance learning and knowledge of the world around us.

I am asking for two students that will be mainly used during our math block and any other available times during the day to practice math skills. The students will be using the iPods, through the use of various apps, to practice number identification, number manipulation and math facts. All of these skills practiced daily through fun apps instead of boring paper and pencil activities will not only differentiate the learning based on each student but will make learning fun and exciting while preparing my students to soar through math!I want my students to reach their full potential and not get left behind in the dust. The iPods will be able to make learning fun and improve my studentsÂÂ math skills. Through your donations you will have the opportunity to take part in growing children into confident mathematicians. I believe that my students could reach their full potential and master the building blocks of math this year if they could only have a chance at having fun while learning math skills. I believe the usage of iPods with fun and exciting math apps will help them reach that goal. Please participate and ignite the fire in my students for math!

My class consists of 20 third grade students who are all anxious and excited about the idea of having a full library with a wide variety of books to explore. Unfortunately, because my school is in a majority low income district, many of my students have not had the luxury of being able to explore through good quality literature. Most of the books that the students at my school get their hands on are books that are outdated, destroyed, and simply not that exciting or engaging to read. My students have yet to experience books that truly allow them to 'go anywhere in the world'. Inevitably, their lack of being exposed to a wide variety of literature has caused their experiences to be limited, thus limiting them when it comes to each of them reaching their full learning potential. Through enriching literature, my students will not only become better readers but I feel that they will become more excited about learning. This will then create life long learners who journey the world through the pages of literature. Through reading, I would like to truly impact the lives of my students. I understand that reading can influence my students to become the life long readers and learners I hope for. By creating a library full of enriching literature, my students will have no other choice but to get excited about reading and learning. With a wide variety of leveled readers and popular chapter books, I will surly be able to motivate each and every one of my students to be excited about exploring literature with me!

3a62d5dd2ff3c1c54f071a492b4b1400,You Can't Learn What You Can't See,"My students are writers, poets, and artists, but don't have the technology resources necessary to share their work and learn from each other. The first graders in my class are hardworking and hungry to learn. Despite their persistence, they face substantial obstacles: 94% of the students at our school receive free or reduced price lunch and the majority of the students in my class are English Language Learners who speak Spanish at home. In my dual immersion class, all students are working on learning or improving their Spanish language comprehension, so visual supports are key to understanding. Without any way to share class work or assignments with all the students, however, many will not be able to see and therefore miss out on the lesson. Being able to show exactly how to perform a new task, or better yet, having a student demonstrate it, is far more powerful for a learner than just being told. A document camera is a boring name for a fantastic device: by hooking it up to an LCD projector, students will be able to project a large image of their work so that all their peers can see and learn from it. When I teach a new strategy, I can demonstrate for the whole group how to employ it, from revising a piece of writing to creating a diagram to solve a math problem. Students will easily transfer a skill to their own work because they've gotten to see exactly how it's done: no telling necessary. I've seen document cameras in action in classrooms, and their impact across the curriculum is impressive. In reading, picture books can be shared so that all students can notice and make inferences from the illustrations. In math, different methods of solving the same problem can be quickly compared. In writing, the teacher can demonstrate a new technique and then show student examples of that skill the very same day. This little camera quickly becomes integrated into the life of the class because it allows the group to achieve something that both teachers and students crave; the ability to easily, almost effortlessly, share the products of student learning so all can see, understand and build on what's been done. This device will drive students to create and show their very best.

Through small group work and learning centers I know I can create a classroom environment that is successful and effective for all my students! My classroom is currently full of 34 second grade students who are all eager to learn and come from very diverse and difficult backgrounds. I teach in a high poverty neighborhood in Arizona, where most of the population in our school are English Language Learners. Our kids have a strong desire to learn and challenge themselves, despite the hard challenges they face at home. They are extremely hard workers and push themselves to 'Achieve the American Dream'.Teaching with small groups and learning centers gives each child the time, effort and education they deserve, and with this teaching easel that can be done so much easier. Our space in limited with so many students, and so many desks so we are trying to find creative ways to store manipulatives and items the students need to use. However, with this storage cart and easel in one I can create centers or small group work that the students will be able to access all in one place. My students deserve the best education possible, and tools such as this easel will help provide quick transitions and easy access, in order to promote more learning time. I can see my students teaching each other using this easel as well, and I cannot wait to put this resource to use in my classroom! I truly believe that a large teaching easel/storage cart could make a huge difference in my students' behavior and learning opportunities. My students will have easy access to learning centers and small group work, which in turn will allow me to meet the needs of my students much more effectively!

The ELMO document camera will allow my students to engage in all-class discussions while viewing historic photographs, political cartoons, posters, letters, speeches, and more. A big component of my history class is working with students to develop higher order thinking skills. These skills will enable them to analyze and engage with media messages they see on a daily basis, encouraging them to view everything with a critical eye. I believe that a big part of getting students engaged with history is answering the question: Why does this matter to me?

Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly.

We work as hard as we can to reach up, and to make the goals that seem extreme become reality. My students are some of the most caring, loving kids you will ever meet - but their love cannot buy them the supplies they need for their daily activities in the classroom. My students attend an inner-city school that has a very low-income average. Actually, the poverty level in my school is so low that all students receive free breakfast and lunch everyday. They also face many challenges in their homes that they have to overcome just to be able to make it to school, much less making it there with more than the bare minimum required to start the day. However, my students are also hungry to learn, and work extremely hard with what we do have to succeed at the highest levels. For my classes, I am requesting materials to build a writing resource center. The materials to do this include pencils, loose leaf paper, construction paper, and materials to help us organize the center itself. With these materials, I hope to help both of my classes of students create authentic and inspirational writing. We will use them in our writers workshop where we will be creating stories, as well as learning to form arguments, which will then be presented to our class as we learn public speaking skills. We will also use the construction paper in our other classes, as we create and design materials to improve our understanding and engagement in what we are learning.

You will never be without laughter on any given day in my classroom. These students are full of potential, but have been broken down by the gaps in education and poverty that engulf their Texas community. My kids will most likely get by if they continue on their current path right now. They will find jobs, get married, and have children. But they will not be living up to their potential. For the most part, they will work in blue-collar jobs and will struggle to provide for their families. Many of them will not go to and through college because they will not be able to afford it and will not know how to succeed in an environment with a whole new level of rigor.

Within our health science program, we offer Health Science 1, Health Science 2, Health Science 3, Sports Medicine 1, Sports Medicine 2, Sports Medicine Internship, and Medical Terminology. All of these courses are designed to motivate students to pursue a health care career. In five of those seven courses the students learn anatomy and physiology of the human body. These charts will help give my students a much better visual of what they are made of and the various systems that are working at any given moment of the day. I will be able to use the charts as references right there in the classroom instead of searching in a book or the Internet for a decent picture. The students will also be able to use them as a reference as they work through various projects associated with each body system. Think about the people who will be taking care of you as you grow older and encounter sickness. Think about your loved ones who may be in the hospital. Who is going to be taking care of you? The answer is the students that we are teaching now. Help me give these students a better understanding of the human body and health care.

'You can find magic wherever you look, sit back and relax, all you need is a book,' by Dr. Seuss. This quote will increase the students' motivation to read. My students are all well-rounded individuals, who have not made the adequate growth in reading that is expected. They attend a low-income school in a K-12 building. The students can develop close relationships with their peers and the teachers. The students mean well and do not have any behavior problems. We have been working hard on developing fluent and accurate readers. Please help us reach our goals. The plastic book boxes will replace the worn out cardboard ones we have previously used. The students use their book boxes multiple times throughout the day during Daily 5 instructional time. The plastic ones will be more durable for student use and will provide more color to the classroom. I am trying to increase the students motivation to read and grow a passion for reading. I will be starting 'flashlight Friday,' where the lights will be shut off and the students will use their flashlight to read. My hope for this will increase the students motivation and reading fluency and of course be fun for the students. Donations for this project will make a difference in my students lives by improving their reading scores. Reading is such an essential life skill, that having non-proficient readers is inexcusable.

Many of the headphones that are on our mobile lab are 5 years old and are broken. Many of my 3rd graders cannot hear the math problems or the stories on Successmaker, which is our individualized learning program. Our charter school has students from a broad economic background. Many families are Title One families. We have to rely on the support of grants or donations to get most of our technology. Unfortunately, when we have our mobile computer lab, many of the students are frustrated because we do not have enough headphones for the students to use. Many of the original headphones are now 5 years old and broken. There are no headphones to use. The students cannot hear the Successmaker program. All students benefit with reading and listening to the program. It helps with their fluency as well. Students who have a low reading level are at a particular disadvantage using our Successmaker program because they cannot read accurately and with fluency the problems on the computer screen without headphones. I believe all of my students need reliable headphones. If each child has their very own headphone to be responsible for, I believe that they will last several years. My Project: The most important computer program in our school for math and reading is our Successmaker computer program. Successmaker is unique in that it can find the student's ability level through questions and problems that the student answers. Then Successmaker individualizes the program to each student's abilities. With a headphone, each one of my students will be able to understand not only by sight, but by hearing the words and sounds all of the educational activities on Successmaker. This will definitely impact the ability of my students to learn their math and reading in 3rd grade. Each of my students will succeed and get confident in their understanding of important concepts of the Common Core. When each student has their own headphone, they will be responsible for a certain labeled headphone that will be placed in a storage bin. I have students of all levels of reading and math ability that need to understand through sight and sound the educational activities on Successmaker. All of my twenty-seven students will achieve to their highest potential when they have the advantage of not only seeing the problems, but hearing the stories and activities on the computer program. This will maximize their learning. Headphones are an invaluable tool for my class to have. Thank you for your support!

Storage sacks will be a great benefit to my students to help them stay organized. My fourth graders attend an elementary school in California's largest urban school district. They come from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as different socioeconomic statuses, which means that some have more access to resources than others. I would like to use Donors Choose as a vehicle in supplying a much needed resource, chair/storage sacks, in order to teach my students how to be and stay organized. No matter what grade level I've taught, from Kindergarten to fourth grade, teaching students to be, and stay, organized has always been a challenge. It isn't a state standard, it's not tested, but it's an important life skill. With chair sacks, students will learn how to keep their things in order. Learning how to be organized will greatly benefit them now and in the future. Please help with our class project however you can!

For most students this will never be a concern, but for my students this is a daily frustration. Help us gain access to the simple joy of recess time. My students are all hard working, funny, and smart. They each have an exceptional smile and laughter that brightens everyone's day. My students inspire me with their individual challenges, unique view of the world we live in, and outpouring of love they have for everyone they meet. My students faced the challenges daily, of having a significant cognitive, physical, social and or speech disability, and are teaching us all how amazing they are, and how lucky we are to know them, and have them in our lives. This project will help the special education students at our school have access to a playground that is currently not accessible to a child with severe cognitive and physical disabilities. Access to the swing will not only provide the child with a disability access, but it will also teach the child without a disability that all children like to swing, regardless of physical ability. The swing will also open up natural opportunities for peer interactions that would not occur otherwise, as the supervising adult can safely step back and allow the non-disabled peers to facilitate the interactive play. This project is so important because it helps bridge the gap between children. Not only does the swing give all kids access to the playground at recess, but it also teaches the kids without disabilities that even though a child has a disability they still enjoy playing and can do the same things as their friends with modifications, helping facilitate positive interactions, and friendships.

I would like to be able to share that wonderful feeling with the students in my classroom. I have a class of 14 sweet kindergarteners who are eager to learn and experience the fun and excitement that comes with being able to attend school. We are a small school in a region of Virginia that has been hit very hard by a faltering economy and the loss of jobs. We are in great need of supplies for daily use in the classroom. Those supplies include large kindergarten crayons, scissors that are safe for small hands, large pencils that are easy for those small hands to grip as they learn how to write, and glue sticks so they can be creative, as well as other items. With the assistance of these items and supplies, my students will learn how to hold and use a pencil/crayon correctly, how to cut using scissors that are made specifically for young children, and how to be creative. We will not only use these supplies for daily activities such a handwriting, coloring, and picture sorts, but also for exciting craft experiences that inspire creative learning. This project is important because kindergarten is the first time some of these children are experiencing school with the exception of those children who attended some form of pre-school. I would like to ensure that these children get every possible benefit from this experience so that they may be fully prepared to go on to do great things in the future.

My goals as a music educator are to instill in my students an appreciation for all things surrounding the arts and to create independent life-long learners of music as well as life. In order for students to become life-long musicians and music learners it is important for students to understand the history of music and great historical figures in music history. Often times students have a difficult time learning about the great classical composers of our past, because they have a difficult time connecting to people that lived so long ago. The Composer DVDs make the lives of famous classical composers such as Bach, Handel and Strauss (to name a few) come alive, while connecting their stories to real life situations that current students can relate to.

It is today that we must create the world of the future.'~Eleanor Roosevelt 'Nothing But the Truth' integrates Civics into the English classroom. My lessons begin by having students explore cases where claims were made that students' first amendment rights were violated. My students are motivated kids who want to learn. This year is a giant transition for them as their middle school was shut down due to budget cuts and they were moved to the local high school where I teach. For the most part, they are the group that represents the above average sector of their grade level, and I believe that researching first amendment court cases and then reading 'Nothing But the Truth' will produce critical thinking and writing from this group. The school they attend is in a lower socioeconomic area where there is little parental involvement. The majority of our school population receives free or reduced lunch. Our district offers free breakfast and most of our students take advantage of this as the free breakfast and free lunch might be all they eat that day. Additionally the students come to me with very little prior or background knowledge of the world outside their community which makes discussion of literature difficult. I will be able to integrate civics into the English classroom by doing a pre-reading activity with the first amendment. Students will understand the first amendment of the constitution as it applies to public school students. They will learn concepts such as advocacy of illegal action, commercial speech, and forum. They will research cases where students' first amendment rights were violated such as Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) where students were suspended for wearing black armbands as a silent protest to the Vietnam War. They will identify the facts of each case, each sides' position, the decision held by the court, and its effect on the country. Students will be grouped by case and will create a digital presentation to share with the class. As a class, we will then read 'Nothing But the Truth' where a student is suspended for humming/singing along to the Star-Spangled Banner instead of standing at silent, respectful attention. We will conclude with a persuasive writing opportunity. Students will have the opportunity to read from books that are new and not falling apart from being used for year after year after year.

My students all attend a public school and spend some time in a special education setting and some time with their typical peers. They have a wide range of skill levels and abilities, but they are all on a functional life skills curriculum, meaning their goals in school are to learn basic skills required to navigate life. With the addition of cooking supplies, including a skillet, a griddle, a crock pot, and kitchen utensils, my students will have the opportunity to learn to make and/or assist in making simple meals. We will be able to make a wide array of foods traditionally cooked on a stovetop including pancakes, tacos, and spaghetti. They will also be given the opportunity to try new foods that they have not tasted in the past, broadening their food preferences through experience.

I am an early childhood special education teacher in a low-income, high-needs public school. My young learners are three to five years old, and each one has an educational disability and/or a developmental delay that impacts his/her functioning and academic achievement. What does 'rocking and 'recking' have to do with learning, anyway? Regulating (calming) activities, like rocking in a rocking chair or building with safe foam blocks and then knocking them down, give children a sense of mastery and calm. My young students are as dysregulated much of the time as you are on those really awful mornings, and having equipment and materials in the classroom to help them calm and focus so they can learn is vital to their success. Help make a difference in these young lives. You will feel happy that you've helped.

No money has been allocated for purchase of ANY creative materials or activities. Our students face the challenge of learning in a date driven environment. Teachers need to justify every minute of the day and show how all activities will produce results. The new teaching model is all about Common Core Assessments. Our students are no different than anyone else's. They enjoy learning but not when they are being bored to tears. They are diverse learners who have their own strengths and individual weaknesses. They learn best when they are stimulated. They have proved this year that when they are allowed to be creative, they are much more motivated to do their best. Our next Common Core Module study is on Colonialism. There are countless pages of worksheets to accompany this module. We would like for the children to experience Colonialism by creating their own Colonial Journals. Collaboratively, they will use the journals to depict aspects of daily life for colonial children and compare them to modern day life. Partners will then create masks and author plays in which they will act out the different aspects of daily life - depicting a comparison of today and yesterday. Rather than complete a graphic organizer, children will be bringing colonial times to life and really get a sense of what it was like to live during the days of our Founding Fathers. Not all children learn the same way. However, Common Core Modules force children, no matter their talent, to fill out worksheet after worksheet based on written material. It is critical to give every child the opportunity to show their strengths. While some thrive on written material, others need to be creative. While some work well alone, others need to collaborate. While some can read texts and spit facts back out, others prefer to think critically to develop their own opinion. Help us shine!

They work hard in speech therapy, but despite their best efforts, there are a few sounds they struggle to master (especially /s/ and /r/). Cutting edge therapy tools, such as Speech Buddies, will give these kids a chance of conquering their targeted sounds. Speech Buddies are radically different from other articulation tools.

My students are committed to their education in both an academic and personal sense. They seek out opportunities, such as the chance to study the culture of Morocco, in order to learn more about the world they live in and their place in it. These high school students hope to strengthen their understanding of the world as they begin to explore their collegiate opportunities, and plan for their futures. The opportunity for students to experience learning on the international stage has long been relegated to those who are financially able to attain these goals. However, my colleagues and I believe that these experiences should be available to all students. In the months leading up to their trip, my students begin conducting research in various areas of the culture of Morocco. For many students, this is the first time they are able to completely self-direct their learning, focusing on various aspects of culture- from fashion trends and choices, to studying the education system in the country they visit. Students will conclude their research by visiting the country they are studying, gaining the chance to live like a local and to see the world from a new perspective. Students gain the opportunity to grow as individuals and as learners as they gain college credit for their research endeavors. In addition, students have the opportunity to give back.

The most effect literacy building activity, which helps to develop math, reading and writing skills, has been introducing the opera to middle school students. Adding technology, like the downloading tunes to student iPods/MP3 players will bring the operas and musicals to the 21st century. Using programs like Discovery Education also transforms classrooms and inspires teachers with engaging content, to fully engaged students in reading the stories, characters, settings, costumes, orchestral music, and actual singing. This project will allow me to use every resource to broaden students' musical and cultural experiences, and continue students regular attendance to the Florida Grand Opera's full dress rehearsals.

134368a11fdaf04492c90bcc9b3899c1,Enriching Storytelling,"Do you remember wanting to hear the same story over and over again as a child? The ability to re-tell a story is an incredible way to build reading comprehension and vocabulary, especially for children with little or no experience with books and stories. My students are enrolled in the first year of the new Indianapolis Public Schools preschool program. They are four and five years old and they are eager learners ready to learn and explore. Many have not experienced daily stories or literature at home and 95% qualify for free or reduced price lunch. Our classroom is housed in an urban, elementary school. The flannel board materials and books that I am requesting will help my students increase their reading comprehension and vocabulary. With the movable flannel pieces that the children will recognize from the stories that they hear in class, the children can re-tell the stories in their own words, building on their ability to recall and remember details from literature, which will equalize their learning readiness to their suburban peers. These children have not had many experiences with stories and books. These materials will give them the opportunity to explore, feel and tell the stories in their words, encouraging learning while they feel they are 'playing.' Since they work in small groups while using the materials, they also engage in conversations with each other, increasing their confidence, verbal skills, and social skills. This pre-K program was designed to give urban children the same opportunities that their suburban peers receive from home or private preschools. We are a universal free school lunch school. Most of my students have not experienced literature and storytelling in their homes. We have one copy of 'Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?,' and the students eagerly wait their turn 'reading' it each day. These materials will truly enrich their vocabularies and story re-telling abilities.

My school is a Title I school with more than 70% of our students on free or reduced-price lunch. Our students are composed mainly of minority groups who come from low socio-economic background. Often they are at a disadvantage because they have difficulty providing for themselves the required resources they need to be competitive in school. To be successful in calculus, my students need to constantly practice their learning and acquired skills and knowledge by doing homework, which more often than not requires a graphing calculator. I would like to have extra calculators that I can check out to them to help them with their homework.

Technology is not the future, because it is already here. The use of technology allows our students to become engage in complex texts and become life-long learners. My students are in a Chicago Public School which has an enrollment of 1,350 students, with 88% of them being low-income and 32% English language learners. My students love to use technology whenever they get the chance because many do not have much technology when they leave the school. As educators who are able to buy certain technological devices, we tend to forget that many of our students do not have that opportunity. Technology is the new resource that engages our students and challenges them academically. Every Monday my students read differentiated articles and answer questions about the article using an online program called Teen Biz. There is a huge problem with implementing this program for all of my students because we do not have enough netbooks for my students. My classes range from 33-38 students! I have to allow my students to use my personal tablet and laptop because we only have 30 netbooks. I also have to send two students to two different classroom to use a desktop. Even with all of these accommodations, there is always at least 2 or 3 students that are not able to do Teen Biz because we do not have enough netbooks. Although some of my students use their cellphones to complete the articles and questions, the small screen on the phones is not beneficial to reading long articles and answering questions. The use of the requested tablets will also serve as an additional resource for my ELL's and struggling readers with the use of specific apps. The tablets will also serve as additional research devices. Honestly, it is a struggle to implement Teen Biz because we need more technological devices. The tablets will allow more students to do Teen Biz activities and improve their literacy skills. Technology motivates and engages all students, regardless of their academic level. The tablets will also expose them to more complex texts, allow my ELL's to acquire language faster, and serve as an additional technological resource in the classroom.

Like I said, my students love reading. Here's the thing: My school serves a very diverse population. Some first graders come to school reading words and even sentences. Other children enter first grade as emergent readers, still working on letter identification and letter sounds. The widest range of learners are found in first grade. Reading levels range from Level A to Level J. Wow! We spend a great deal of time working in small groups, addressing the skills individual students need to strengthen. I spend many hours researching the best ways to meet my students' needs. Technology is one tool that can be used in a variety of ways to help me meet those needs. My school believes in technology. We've made fundraising efforts for technology support. However, most of that technology is used by students in grades 2-6. My classroom has 2 desktop computers for students to use. I would like to change that. I want to provide another form of technology for my students that supports their learning. Kindle now offers many high quality learning apps that cover a range of learning skills and levels. My goal is to furnish my classroom with at least 6 Kindles.

A dry erase white board allowing students to write their ideas for all to see is one way to motivate our young learners. I teach bright highly motivated first grade students in a New York City public school. We live in the borough of Queens, a part of our nation that enjoys a deserved reputation for diversity. Our school community is an international one and we share the rich heritage of many cultures. With that diversity and global perspective comes expectations to bring the best resources and education possible to young children who seek to achieve academic success. Our young parents are keenly aware of new ways of learning and the power of interactivity in that process. We know that learning from peers is an integral part of the acquisition of knowledge and sometimes simple tools can go far to achieve that goal. Our families are our partners in learning and support us in ways that include class visits to celebrate student work. I have seen the excitement students have in putting their work on the blackboard in the front of the room. I have also discovered that as we move around, students are eager to share their work but need something portable on which to write. The dry erase board is a simple tool that requires no technological expertise yet it encourages students who work in groups to share by simply writing or drawing their ideas. I have requested a dry erase board that is 4 feet by 6 feet so it is large enough for a group to post ideas yet small enough to be portable. This dry erase board can be moved with ease around the room, has a stand, is relatively light, and can even be propped up against the blackboard in the front of the room. This is a low tech solution to increasing interactivity, motivating student participation that enhances engagement. I have also requested different colored dry erase markers for students to use. Students love to write on a board (usually a blackboard) and this dry erase board gives us the opportunity to write anywhere in the room, as groups convene for independent work. This board doesn't require electrical power or special training to use, is dust free, and and can encourage student participation as the children write their ideas for all to see.

Each student's presentation and report will be evaluated using a rubric reflecting common Core Standards in the areas of speaking and listening. This project will give them the hands-on materials they need to experiment with the things they are learning about in Science. The materials will be placed in their non-fiction center where they can experiment with each one. Research supports the notion that anyone can greatly reduce their fears of public speaking through a series of presenting 22 or more oral presentation sessions. These materials will make a difference in the lives of my students because it will give them the opportunity to truly experiment with things they are learning about which will cultivate a curiosity and love of learning in them.

Just go sharpen it. But the teacher's ancient pencil sharpener won't sharpen evenly. A heavy duty electric pencil sharpener could easily solve this problem. I teach 110 awesome seventh grade English students. We spend a large percentage of our time writing about literature, current events, and the crazy events that make up their lives. Our transition to common core has increased the amount of time that we spend writing. After our school experienced a devastating tornado on May 20, we have been fortunate to receive donations of pencils and paper to last throughout the year. One item that would help significantly is an electric pencil sharpener. It would allow students to quickly and efficiently sharpen their pencils and return to work. A heavy duty electric pencil sharpener placed in the front of the classroom will allow students to sharpen their pencils as soon as they enter the room so that they can begin working as soon as class starts. It will be convenient for use anytime during class as well. Electric pencil sharpeners sharpen more quickly and accurately than the old sharpeners that we already use. Their sharp pencils will help their brilliant ideas flow onto their paper! We have an old crank-style pencil sharpener and a couple of dozen handheld pencil sharpeners, but the addition of an electric pencil sharpener would cut down on the number of times that students needed to get up out of their seats, therefore allowing them to spend more time on task. Also, a sharp pencil makes the students feel like he or she is doing the best work possible!

They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. We have a rapidly expanding band program. If the rate of growth keeps up, I will not be able to get instruments to all the students who want to join band next year. I have been acquiring instruments in every way I can, but even with the used instruments I've been able to acquire, I haven't been able to keep up with the need for instruments among students who couldn't otherwise afford to rent or buy one from a music store. This instrument will not only give many students an enriching opportunity to learn to play saxophone, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing this saxophone could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special.

Their parents are very supportive and work with their children to ensure success in school. Our students are bright and motivated. They enjoy learning about and using new technology. They amaze us with their ideas and willingness to persevere when faced with a problem. Our students have been creating products digitally, and we are ready to go to the next level and use the skills they have learned to have an object come to life. We think the best way to get started is with the Lego Robotics kit. Students will then be able to design and create a robot of any style and with any function. Seeing their designs come to life will allow our students to experience a true 21st century classroom. The skills students will acquire by learning to use a true robotics kit will help them throughout their school career and into the workforce.

Many don't get the opportunity to bring supplies to school. Their parents often have to make the choice between paying bills, or buying supplies...buying groceries, or buying supplies. As a result, I try to stand in the gap as much as possible, purchasing basic supplies whenever I can. As the prices increase from year to year, this becomes more challenging for me.

We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. Students will be mainly using these vices to make me deaf. Okay, not really. Vices are an essential tool in any shop- holding pieces to be cut, pressing bits together, hammering on the anvil, bending, the list could go on for miles. We mainly use these vices in my metals class- where I teach them how to punch holes in metal, set rivets, groove seams, and straighten projects that might have gotten a little off kilter. How will this make a difference? Well, It will let my students DOUBLE their productivity. Instead of 20 students in 2 lines waiting for a vise, I'll have 20 students in 4 lines waiting.

Or the voice of your teacher turns into the monotonous tones of Charlie Brown's teacher? Anyone who has been a student can attest to this feeling. In the digital world, 21st century learners are struggling more than ever to stay engaged in a lesson. All you have to do is Google, 'kids attention span and technology,' and you will get a plethora of articles and studies arguing that the digital world we live in has desensitized children to heavy stimulation. I find myself working harder than ever to keep sound teaching practices engaging for my students. In addition, the majority of my students come from low socioeconomic backgrounds, their cultural and academic experiences diminish their confidence when it comes time to crack open the textbook or begin writing. Too often I see them mentally checked out before they even have to get started! In turn, they get frustrated and lose enthusiasm in what we're learning! Hand them an iPad, however, and no matter what you ask them to do, they are ready and motivated to take on whatever challenge you give them! With iPads, I can begin incorporating this interactive technology into my daily lessons. The options are endless. Individual students, who seriously struggle with motivation to read, can use the iPads to access the online textbook, which enhances the reading with videos and animated pictures. Students can work in collaborative groups to access my Prezis, digitally stimulating presentations, and take control of their own learning. With the Adobe Reader app, students can have directions, quizzes or other activities read to them. Quizlet will enable students to take assessments online and receive immediate feedback to maximize their learning. The iPads will engage, motivate and enable students to interact with their learning! By supporting this project you will enable my students to learn more deeply and in an exciting and memorable way. In addition to their learning, you will help my students gain confidence as learners and people as they see their curiosity and hard work turn into success.

Kennedy. A powerful statement that empowers me to provide my students with fun and interactive ways to keep their minds bursting with knowledge. My students have bright smiles that light up the classroom despite their disabilities that range from moderate to severe diagnosis. Each day they are exposed to functional learning experiences that engage their minds and help them to understand the world they are living in. Our school community welcomes students with disabilities and promotes an inclusive setting. It is in these exclusive settings that my students are able to work with their same age peers and develop friendships. Physical Education is an important part of my students' fine and gross motor skills development. My students need more instructional time to master movement concepts and instruction needs to be engaging, creative, and fun! The target toss and comet balls are one of the ways my students can work on their motor skills. The activity mats, toss and catch play set, and balancing spoon game are also ways to promote skills development while also teaching them cooperative play. These hands-on active play resources will help my students gain the practice they need not only through the school year, but also while attending summer school. Additionally, my students will also be learning new vocabulary, practicing math skills, and learning some science concepts. By having these additional opportunities to learn these academic skills, my students will begin to generalize the concepts and learn that language, math, and science can be done outside while having fun in the sun! As a first year Special Education teacher, my goal is to provide my students with the necessary skills to learn at their individual levels, while introducing functional concepts. The best way to accomplish this is to provide a variety of learning opportunities in multiple learning modalities. That is why this project is important to me. Your donation will help me expand our functional curriculum to the outdoors and that will not only benefit my students this year, but in years to come. Thank-you.

The touch screen facilitates easy use for tiny fingers still developing fine motor skills. The highly visual and animated delivery of iPad educational apps captures their imagination, motivates their desire to learn, and provides the authentic use of technology to master essential knowledge and skills. We are requesting three iPads. One of our teachers previously received an iPad through a grant. If this Donors Choose project is funded, the iPads will be placed permanently in each classroom. The use of the iPads will offer a plethora of appealing, hands-on learning experiences that will facilitate the mastery of kindergarten skills. The iPads will be utilized by independent student use in literacy and math stations. Students could use Tellagami, Videolicious, or Puppet Pals app to retell or create their own fairy tale. Another possibility would be to use Educreations app to describe the plant cycle or their animal research. Haiku Deck could be used to show their learning about landforms or science tools. The possibilities are endless! We want to provide a technology tool that will appeal to our 21st century learners, enhance instruction, and increase student learning.

I try to keep some interesting art books and magazines on hand in the class room for them. They really seem to enjoy reading about artists and styles of art from short magazine articles. The student examples in the Scholastic Magazines seem to inspire them to try harder and learn more. Sadly, the magazines that I do have are mostly out dated hand me downs that are tattered and falling apart. My students need Scholastic Art Magazines for the 2014-2015 school year. The new subscription of Scholastic Art Magazine that we are asking for would be so motivating for my students. They are getting tired of seeing the same old magazines year after year.

Remember how proud of that earthly achievement you were? But what if you had no place to sit and observe this seed's journey? The students at Cicely Tyson School are all very dedicated to their garden. It was a completely new experience for these children since they live in a very dense city where safe parks, and green areas are hard to come by. When the children are at school, they are surrounded by daily joys, happy faces and lots of learning, but when they leave the building there are few places to enjoy the outdoors, let alone observe and learn in the garden they worked so hard to create. They are extremely proud of this particular space, which is home to many vegetables, and herbs, which will return again this spring! These students are so committed to the garden that they even take turns arriving at 6:00 am over the summer to care for the garden before the heat of the sun arrives. They are looking forward to having a place to sit so that they can spend more meaningful time in the schoolyard garden. These happy gardeners range in age from 5 to12 years old, and each play an important role! These benches will be used daily from Spring to Summer, and all throughout the fall. In the event of a mild winter, they can enjoy the wonders of winter and make use of the benches then as well. The main purpose of the benches will be to offer a place to sit while making notes in growth charts, seedling transfers, and general maintenance of the garden. Students will also have access to the benches during science, language arts, and visual arts where they can sit and enjoy a lesson with hands on experience and opportunity. The impact of learning from hands on experience in the garden is priceless. There have been countless studies that have noted this particular value, and it is my goal to provide this experience for my students in the most effective way. Although our garden is on its way, it is truly not ready for serious learning if the children must sit in an uncomfortable manner. Having convertible benches will provide a place to write and learn in its proper way. The lives of my students' will greatly be impacted by this donation!

I teach reading and social studies to two groups of very active 3rd graders that are at different levels academically. At any given moment throughout the day you can find some of them standing up doing their work, sitting on their feet, rocking, or tipping back in their chairs. While doing these things, some are focused and doing their work, but many are focused on something else. I am requesting 3 pink limited edition Susan G. Komen for the Cure 18' Hokki Stools to help the more active students in my class to sit and focus. These stools will join the stools we already have, allowing more students to sit on them during the day and in small group during our guided reading period. The wonderful difference with these stools compared to the stools that we already have is that they are Susan G. Komen for the Cure pink stools. A portion of the sales from each stool will go to assist with saving lives and ending breast cancer.

e4ad76140432bb59d306629e9e4f8cb4,Our Journey with Sassy Simone Sandford- Book Series Study,"My students were all able to read Book 1 of the Sassy series by Sharon Draper. Each child had a copy of the book while I read aloud to them. Every single student was engaged! Day by day they anticipated what will happen next. Students also created a 'Sassy Journal' exploring point of view. My students are third graders with a real passion for hands-on learning through books. When reading aloud to them I see the sparkle in their eyes, but I also see them more engaged if they also have a copy of the book I am reading. It is often difficult to keep their attention for long periods of time. This, however, is NOT the case when it comes Sharon Draper's book 'Sassy-Little Sister is not my name!' This was one of the most rewarding times I spent with my students with a chapter book. There were chapter questions for each chapter where students had to revisit the chapter to answer. There were opportunities for creativity when students wrote in the character's point of view. After we finished book 1, the students said, 'This was the best book ever! Are we reading book 2-4?' Our school is comprised of all of the third and fourth graders in our district. We are located in a low-income area with a high rate of students receiving free or reduced lunch. My students will use the classroom sets of the chapter book series of 'Sassy,' by author Sharon M. Draper, during our reading block. During this time we sit in a 'U' shape with our desks and engage ourselves in book discussions for every chapter. We will answer questions created that are Common Core driven. Creativity will be involved, as they create their 'Sassy' journals, and students will be able to each have a copy where they will be able to work in literature circles with their peers. The book will also serve as a resource if students need to review the text for an activity or lesson involving the book. The students will be able to learn about writing point of view from a chapter book. The students will also be able to better understand a book through well thought out questions; based on the chapters and created by the Sharon Draper website. After reading the 1st book my students are truly becoming anxious in reading more chapter books. Donations to this project will improve my classroom as it will allow students to have a joyful experience with the love of reading chapter books. My students were at first hesitant to read chapter books. However, reading aloud with everyone having a copy impacted my highest reader to my lowest reader in my class. Everyone was engaged. I think that finishing a series with such an impacting character that the students lov, would influence them to read more chapter book series independently.

Technology in the classroom has made an incredible difference in my ability to meet the needs of my individual students. The development of STEM proficient students begins in elementary school as students explore increasingly complex concepts in math, science, engineering, and technology. One goal of STEM education is to engage students in a variety of learning activities that require them to understand and address real life issues and challenges.

It is my responsibility to equip them with the skills they will need to be successful, not just in the next grade, but in life. To achieve this, my students need to become logical and critical thinkers, experts at collaboration, and effective communicators. STEM activities are the perfect vehicle.

My 2nd grade students are eager learners who reside in a low-income, culturally diverse suburban community. At least 75% of the students in the school are on free or reduced lunch. Many families struggle to make ends meet. As a result, they have limited funds to provide resources in the home such as books and the Internet. Additionally, many families have never been more than a few miles outside the community. The outcome is that our students do not have the background knowledge or opportunity to learn about the world and how it is shaped by current events.

We have the highest rate of ELL (English language learners) in the state and have a high amount of special education students. Even with all of these facts against my students they love school! They want to learn and come in each day eager to work hard! Since we have had the great opportunity through Donorschoose to add technology into our classroom I have seen my students excel. We are so lucky to have five iPads that each of my students now and in the future will be able to use and learn on. My ultimate goal is to get technology into the hands of each student. This is a huge challenge but I know it can be accomplished! With an iPad my students are able to work on reading, writing, science and social studies. At first I thought we would mostly use the iPad for math and reading but since receiving them we have been able to do science projects with the help of the iPad and social studies reports! WOW! Amazing what technology has brought to my classroom! I also use the iPad as a behavior reward. If a child has a good day he/she can earn time on the iPad. This has worked really well!This iPad will help my students work on the newest technology and will give each of them life skills they need to succeed.

Reflecting on the words of Aristotle, in order to ensure that we have repeated excellence, we need to get the basics of organization! I want to start our third year stronger than ever, not scrambling for basic supplies. My students are the hardest working students around! They love basketball, singing, dancing and seeing their progress grow! They love to be organized, but have some trouble in the details (like when our staplers break because they've been used to death for so long, or having only one hole puncher for our whole class). While they are the most incredible young minds, there are many difficulties inherent in being a rural, Title I, 100% poverty school that can distract us from the real effort of learning and growing. Help me afford to get these basics of organization taken care of to alleviate our organizing woes! In our third year in Ms. G's room, I envision a seamlessly organized classroom. Each student will have their own tray, which will be used to store binders in class and to hand out any work for that day. The bright paper and ink will be used for creating permanent reference sheets, and the staplers and hole puncher will ensure we have no problem staying organized! Again, excellence is not an act but a habit, and staying organized will help us get there! This project will help us start the 2014-2015 school year strong with consistent routines and structures that will enable the greatest growth and success yet! As all teachers know, without structure, nothing else happens so I cannot wait to solidify what we have in place. Having these organizational and note-keeping tools will change my students' lives as they realize that excellence truly is a habit, failing to plan for success is planning to fail, and to grow, we must first plant some seeds!

Currently they are not ALL able to use their iPads to the fullest learning potential. I teach 16 bright third grade students. I teach in a school district where 54% are economically disadvantaged. Last year our technology department was able to move funds around and provided our entire third grade with iPads. These iPads have made huge gains for our classrooms in reading, math, computer science skills, and much more! Our third grade students are so grateful for the opportunity to have iPads in our classrooms, but we have found situations where keypads to go with our iPads are much needed. We use a computer skill learning program and it would be very beneficial to have keyboards to use it. In third grade we also create a lot of projects using PowerPoint and Word. These projects can be created on the iPads, but would be created much easier if we had keyboards. Also, next year our third grade students will take the Smarter Balanced Assessment and keyboards will make test taking much smoother. With our iPads we don't want our students to lose out on typing and we want to make use of our iPads the best we can. Currently we have received nine keyboards through Donors Choose and outside funding. My students use these nine any chance they get. We would like to add these six to get close to completing our classroom set. Receiving our iPads was a dream come true for our students. Having a classroom set of keyboards for our iPads would be like icing on their dream! These keyboards will allow my students to do everything they want and need to do on their iPads.

Their imaginations are like most kindergartners with one exception - most will NOT get an opportunity to vacation in exotic places until they become adults and even then, the opportunity might not be afforded to them. My students have an appetite for adventure and long to visit far away places that are found on our frayed continent carpet and in the books that are read to them. It is my desire to give them a sense of community and ownership of personal space when we have reading time and lessons on the carpet. My students are part of a K-8 Center with multicultural languages and cultures. Therefore, the appeal for materials to peak the interest and enlighten students of other cultures is always present. We pride ourselves in exploring the diverse differences found within the various cultures in our school. These students will have a special spot or country to identify when coming to the carpet for read-aloud, morning and/or afternoon sessions, and any other lessons which will take place in the carpet area. They will learn about being a community of learners who respect others and take responsibility of their respective country or spot. What a joy it would be for them to sing one of their favorite songs on the new carpet: CONTINENTS by Ron BrownPull out the map and what do you seeSeven chunks of the land, what can they be?Africa, Asia, Antarctica, when you get to Australia there's a kangaroo, andTwo Americas - North and SouthWhen you get to Europe - Open your mouth!The continents, con-tin-ents, con-tin-ents, the continents. By following the song, the students will jump on the location of each continent as they sing along. This would implant the continents into their psychic for future class participation. Each student will be assigned a country/flag from the carpet. They will take ownership of the country, explore the tastes, customs, apparels, and sounds of their individual country. This will enlighten them of the differences in cultures and those things which are alike in human beings. In addition, they will learn how to be respectful, responsible, and safe in the classroom and how it is a privilege to sit on the carpet and participate as a classroom community of learners.

My class of six-year old and seven-year old students live in a close-knit, low-income neighborhood. Many of their parents also attended our school. They love to learn but many face hardships at home; including parents who are incarcerated, one parent homes, and parents who fight often in front of them. Many of my students come to school to escape difficulties at home. School is their bridge to success. I see myself not only as a teacher of content but a role model for what one can achieve through hard work and perseverance. I try to open their minds to what awaits them in the world and what possibilities their futures can hold. Learning to read can be a daunting task. Students need many experiences with reading books and other materials. These durable book holders will allow my students a special place to keep the books they are reading. Now, their books often get pushed into their desks, sometimes damaging the book, or fall out onto the floor. My students love to read so they try to hold onto several books at once. These book holders will allow them to more easily see the books they have chosen and which ones they want to return to our classroom library. They can carry the book holders with them when looking for a cozy place to read. These durable book holders will benefit my current students, as well as all of my future students.

My pre-k students are four and five year olds who attend a public school in Texas with a high poverty rate. My students are either from families below the line of poverty or English as a second language learners. My students have a love for school, where they have many new experiences such as painting, puzzles, singing, and and listening to books. They are like sponges absorbing knowledge very quickly, and I am privileged to be a part of their growth! My students need books for read alouds to match our thematic units. Reading aloud to my students is one of the best ways that I can build their vocabularies. Especially with my English as second language learners, developing vocabulary is one of my biggest goals of the year. Our pre-k curriculum is organized by thematic units, so these books will provide additional read aloud opportunities that fit into our themes. The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book is an excellent way to teach and review upper case and lower case letters. The copies of Five Little Ducks will allow my students to hold their own copy of the book while they listen to the audio book. After I read the books aloud, all of the books in this project will be placed in my library center, where my students can re-read the books and re-tell the story. They will follow up their comprehension by drawing a picture of the stories in their journal. These books will be used for many years and impact many students! Having quality children's literature to read aloud to my pre-k students will develop their vocabularies with words that they will remember and use for their entire life! My hope is to develop a class full of children who love books and reading and who will never stop reading!

Do you remember learning history in school, using only a boring textbook? Well I sure do! Even today we still have the textbook! The textbook is great, but we need more! We are requesting a subscription to Cicero Kids. This subscription will allow my students to have hands-on, interactive access to learning history. Students today are 21st Century Learners and having access to Cicero Kids will enhance their learning and will make them eager to learn more. We will use this interactive site to learn more about the history required in our standards. Not only will we be learning history, but Cicero Kids is cross curricular and it supports other areas of education such as reading, language arts, math, etc. My students will gain a wealth of knowledge through this resource in a fun and engaging way.

If so, it's probably because you felt like you were memorizing information about dates, places, and people that didn't seem real. I don't want my students to feel that way about history. Students in our school include military dependents, English language learners, students with disabilities, gifted learners, and talented artists. They are all full of energy and curiosity. They want to understand what they study, rather than memorizing facts. My goal is to make learning fun and meaningful for them through interactive lessons. I believe that is the key to helping children develop a lifelong love of learning. CICERO Kids is a digital curriculum that would be an excellent way to help teach my students about our nation's history. Pictures, videos, music, maps, and timelines will make the content more meaningful because it will help my students visualize and understand historical events and their causes. The interactive games will keep my students interested and help them build and demonstrate knowledge. Since literacy, science, math, and character education are included in the lessons on CICERO Kids my students will build skills in other content areas as they learn history. As an added bonus, CICERO Kids can be accessed on any device with an Internet connection. That means it will be available to them at school, home, and on the go. Learning can happen any time, any place. Please consider supporting this project. It will help my students meet grade level standards in multiple subject areas while building a stronger foundation for their academic careers.

When my students see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know the next art project. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We have academic clubs after school, and daily pull-out academic programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. The pliers requested will be used by me to cut wire for my students painted sculptures. My students will bend and shape the wire into amorphic shapes and place on plastic sheet pocket protectors needed. They will take the window art paint needed to create colorful designs of lines, shapes, and patterns inside the wire. Once the paint dries, the students will peel off the plastic and form sculptures by bending and manipulating the pliable paint into 3-dimensional sculptures inspired by the famous artist Chiuly. This is an exciting, unique 3-dimensional project that I would also like to display in the library to generate art awareness an the importance to keep the arts in the public schools. Students will learn from the video needed that Chiuly has created glass blown art that is organically part of of nature. They will observe that he has colorful art installations around the world of glass blown art combining art, water, nature, flowers, and tress. Through the video and classroom discussion of Chiuly's work, my students will learn the importance of collaborating and sharing, leads to positive outcomes in the arts and life. They will learn that Chiuly is blind in one eye an is still able to create beautiful glass blown art by collaborating too. Many of my art students have not even been to a museum.

I teach a 4th/5th grade combination class. My students come from a high poverty neighborhood where more than 75% of them receive free or reduced-price lunch. There are a very diverse range of home structures: nuclear, single parent, multiple-family, foster, migrant, and military, to name a few. Our students also come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, with a large portion being Hispanic, Punjabi and African American. Additionally, we have a large population of English Language Learners. With such diversity, it is to be expected that each student is going to have a very divergent range of personal, social, emotional, and educational needs when compared to schools that serve a more homogeneous population. As a class we will be reading 'The One and Only Ivan', a story about a captured gorilla who befriends a captured baby elephant. My students will then be researching and learning more about endangered animals using the books requested. The students will be split up into groups and focus their research on one habitat and the endangered animals that live in it. During their research, the students will be using the scissors, glue sticks, and colored pens to record their information into their interactive journals. At the end of the research, each group will create presentations about the endangered species in their habitat and what we can do to help save the animals. The goal of this project is for students to share this information throughout the school and raise awareness of the animals on the endangered species list and share ways in which we can help. This project will engage and teach students through the high-interest class read, along with the other high-interest non-fiction books. Students will not only be learning about regular school topics, but they will learn how to make a difference in the world by learning about how to help and save endangered species. Life skills are embedded throughout this project as students use their research skills to figure out a way to solve a problem and take a stand for something they believe in.

As a primary teacher most of my day is spent guided their learning in the area of English language arts. Guided reading is the best way to facilitate literacy skills. My students live in area of high poverty in northern New Jersey. More than half of my students qualify for free or reduced lunch. They all receive free breakfast. They are very hard working and their families are extremely supportive despite their economic shortcomings. My students all have an overwhelming desire to learn and want to make the most of their time in my class. Guided reading is small group instruction in which the teacher 'guides' students through a text that is at the children's instructional reading level. The role of the teacher is crucial in guided reading. Guided reading is planned, focused instruction. The ultimate goal is to foster independent readers. Because of the overcrowding in some classrooms, I will be transforming my current reading table to accommodate more students as desks. I need a horseshoe table that sole purpose is for guided reading. Without this guided reading table, I will be unable to meet and facilitate with each student. This table will be used to run strategy groups with 6 students at a time in order to advance their literacy skills throughout the school year.

As a dedicated teacher, I want to provide my students with a way to keep their bodies and minds active without disrupting the learning of others. This year I am teaching in a single-gender classroom consisting of twenty boys of varying ability levels. Our elementary school is located in a small town in South Carolina. Although the students come from a variety of backgrounds, there is one common problem that many of my students face- the need for movement. Many of my students are very active and full of energy. They often find it hard to sit still and focus on their work. Because of this, they often disrupt the learning of other students around them. My students are very smart and capable of anything; many of them just need help focusing. Standing desks and stability balls just may be the solution to our problem! The stability balls will enable students to wiggle while they work! The students will be able to move around, yet it won't distract others who are working around them. Instead of focusing on sitting still, students can focus on their learning while improving their balance, posture, and strength. The stability balls will be used for small group instruction, group work, and just anytime a child feels like they need to use one in order to focus! Students will also have access to the standing desks anytime they feel like they'd rather stand up to work/listen rather than sit still in their desks. I want to encourage my students to move and stay active, not sit still, and these alternatives will help to achieve this goal. While my active students will reap many learning and health benefits from these stools, this product will also be beneficial to the students around them because the movement is not large enough to distract my teaching or the learning of the other students. This new furniture will help all students become better focused and my teaching become uninterrupted. In terms of health and academics, everyone will benefit from the addition of standing desks and stability balls into our classroom!

As a teacher, I realize the importance of starting the new school year off on the right track. I also realize that some of my new students may not have basic supplies when they enter my classroom. I believe that if I am able to provide them with basic supplies, they will start the year off motivated and excited about learning. I believe that I must start the year off by making learning visual and hands-on. This is important to me because I realize that children learn best when they are active rather than passive learners.

' -David Warlick My 2nd grade students attend an inner city public school that consists of low income families. Sadly, many of the students lack the resources and support to have technology experience at home. Despite their home environment they are very inquisitive and have a strong desire to learn. School is the only place that offers opportunities for students to explore, interact, experience and learn what their financially well off peers learn at such an earlier age. Unfortunately, with the lack of cuts and funding our schools are having difficulty providing the necessary provisions to help our students prepare and compete in the 21st century. My main goal is to increase students reading abilities, promote the love of books and provide a range of learning opportunities for students to understand and grasp concepts through the use of Kindle Fires. The use of Kindle Fires will offer my students opportunities for development and participation in fun and educational learning. This engagement will equip students to better understand concepts and help them independently organize their learning experiences according to their interests and the abilities. The Kindle offers access to reading, science, social studies and math applications for various learning levels. Our internet access will allow the students to research topics and participate in district lined assessments more efficiently. Students will work independently and in small groups to complete tasks and assessments. Your support for this project will help prepare students for a changing world.

My school is located in the urban South. Nearly all of the students come from low-income families, which makes us a Title I school, and nearly all are students of color. They are eager, curious children on the brink of adolescence, and they are passionate about issues of social justice, history, and multiculturalism. With these social-studies themed books, I will be able to help open up students to the world around them. Specifically, in fifth grade we study topics throughout US History, such as the Civil War, Civil Rights, immigration, and civics. We don't have a specific block of time in our schedule for social studies, so we will use these picture books not only to become better readers and writers, but to integrate many important social studies concepts into the curriculum. I believe that representing my diverse students' backgrounds in the curriculum is incredibly important. I want to read them books with characters who look like them and come from different countries like them, so that they can learn about the complex roots of American culture.

Due to the budget crunch, each teacher at my school has been allotted one hundred dollars for supplies. After ordering copy paper, binder paper and pencils, there's not a lot of money left for other items such as dry erase markers. With all of the work my students do on the white boards, we run out of dry erase marker within the first month of school. I call it 'The Competition.' Each pair of students gets a white board and a dry erase marker. I put problems on the overhead, they each work it out, write the answer on the white board, and then hold it up for me to quickly say, 'Correct or try again.' They then go on to the next problem as soon as they are finished. They are very competitive and work hard at doing as many problems as possible. It is amazing to see all of my students working and working fast. I know it's because they get to write it down on a white board, and they quickly find out if they are right. I am also able to easily see who is not getting it and help them right away instead of waiting to see what they don't get on the test. The more work they do, the more they will learn.

I learned to read at age three, and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in Mississippi.' My students come from impoverished homes where survival is priority. When my 5 and 6 years old walk into school most of them have never listened to a story or even seen a book. What parents do, or do not do, has a lasting impact on their child's reading skill and literacy. As a kindergarten teacher in an urban district, I have several challenges I must overcome in order for my students to not only learn how to read, but love to read. Books can be my student's pass to personal freedom and inspiration to change their life. My students deserve the very best. Unfortunately, our school's budget is unable to afford the resources our students need and deserve. Help my eager and loving learners reach their greatest potential! Hearing a book read on tape helps children see how the words on the page can come alive in a fluid, expressive way. It helps them focus on the sounds of words read without interruption and provides a model of fluent reading. Audio books also give children an important introduction to listening--a skill that he/she must master in order to learn to read. I plan to set up a listening center so that four children can listen to the same book at the same time. This can provide a wonderful opportunity for children to hear their favorite books read aloud again and again. The more they listen, the greater the likelihood that they will learn new vocabulary words. And, when listening with a special friend, the opportunities for playing creatively and acting out parts of the story are endless. This will be an invaluable addition to our learning centers! Many books on tape have interesting sound effects, music, and multiple narrators that are especially motivating and fun for young children. Narrators on tape tend to embellish their storytelling with silly voices and dramatic enhancements. They emphasize reading as a source of pleasure rather than a skill, and make children eager to learn how to read. Your generous donation will be a gift that will keep on giving!

Unfortunately, these instruments have been around for a while, and the care, cleaning and maintenance supplies are long gone.

Throughout the summer, you still keep an eye on it, and make sure that everything is set for a smooth ride. The same is true for instruments. They must be cleaned and oiled/greased in order to be in good playing condition. When corks dry and crack, you cannot put or keep a clarinet together. When valves and slides are dry, it creates friction and resistance, which results in no music.

Though a majority of my students are from a low socio-economic background, they are charged with enthusiasm for learning and interacting with new materials. Unfortunately, for most of them the only opportunity for this exposure is during the time they spend in school. These children depend on us to provide them with all they need to be well equipped for the world. Many of my students come from homes where either the parents do not speak English, work multiple jobs to make ends meet, or are just not involved in their children's lives. They have the hunger to learn and for these precious children an good education is their ticket out of their low economic barrier. They deserve to have the chance to turn their lives around. So when they come to school, I want to do my best to make sure they are well taken care of and that I have done everything in my power to ensure a love for learning. My students need 25 subscriptions to Scholastic StoryWorks Magazine to enhance their literary experience. These magazines have been highly recommended. I have used Scholastic Magazines in my classroom for years. Last year a colleague introduced me to StoryWorks. I was able to visit her classroom and see how she uses it with her students. I was impressed with how the students were engaged, interacted with the magazine and how they used it to collaborate in group discussions. The teacher used the issue as a starting point for individualized units of study. Watching her and her students interact and feeling the energy in the room that this magazine created gave me the motivation I needed to introduce it in my own classroom. Each subscription is centered around one essential question for students to explore. It includes 10 different genres, including poetry, interviews, and debates, just to name a few. The subscriptions also comes a digital component, allowing me to incorporate technology into the exploration of topics. Students will also be able to take these magazines home use them for homework assignments and share the information. As a teacher I know that StoryWorks will allow me to provide students with texts that are exciting to read in whole group, by themselves, or with a buddy. The variety of literature that StoryWorks provides allows students to explore beyond their borders. Unfortunately, I was not able to get this ordered through my school, but with your help my students will have a great addition to their reading selection. They will be able to have literature that can learn from and be enjoyable. ",My students need 25 subscriptions to Scholastic StoryWorks Magazine to enhance their literary experience.

The majority of our students live well below the national poverty level. Many of our families earn their living from the Gulf of Mexico, which has been slowly bouncing back from numerous unfortunate circumstances....and while we do see the recovery, many of our families and students still have a difficult time buying the basic essentials needed to make the most of their elementary school years! I am requesting several different items that we use on a daily basis: Elmer's Liquid Glue, Glue Sticks, Fiskars Scissors, Crayola Colored Pencils, Pens, Cap Erasers, and Post-it-Notes. These are our most basic supplies, and while they are not very expensive items by themselves, keeping all of them adequately replenished for an entire classroom of children is! I am also requesting basic good hygiene supplies: Liquid Hand Soap, Kleenex, and Clorox Wipes..... We need these because cold and flu season is just around the corner and we have to keep our students healthy and in school in order for them to be successful....

This upcoming school year will begin my fifth year as a special education teacher at the early childhood level. I will be teaching 25 students in an integrated kindergarten classroom. This means I will be working alongside with a general education teacher to teach students with varying abilities and academic goals. Our school is Title I funded and we have a large population of students who come from homes that speak a language other then English. My students love listening to stories at the meeting area and writing stories about animals and insects. The disabilities affecting my students include speech impairment, learning disabled, emotionally disturbed and autism. I am requesting an assortment of basic classroom supplies to help get our classroom running for the upcoming school year. I am requesting assorted tags to create bus tags for students' backpacks, staples, stapler remover, different tape for student work, pens, special markers for flip charts, book rings for students' work and basic classroom office supplies. In kindergarten, we create a lot of our very own books to publish. We use a lot of tape to piece some of our pictures together and display them throughout the classroom. We love to display our student work for visitors to see! This project will make sure we have enough book rings to piece together our writing projects and enough staples in our writing center so that young writers can make as many writing booklets as they want! We are not provided with the funds to purchase the everyday basic school supplies we need to begin the school year.

Some students come with supplies, but many can't afford school supplies. Imagine being one of the many student who cannot afford the school supplies. My students are very excited and motivated to learn. The supplies that they do come with seem to break easily or do not last a school year. However, many of the students cannot afford the school supplies that they need, and they have to borrow or watch the others who do have supplies. Our school has about a 75% poverty level. The supplies we are asking for are very important to my students' learning. The post-it notes are wonderful for my students to take notes on while they are reading. The colored pens are perfect for my students to have at their fingertips while completing their thinking maps. The take-home folders are a nice addition for taking home their papers and notes so they don't lose their papers. The lined paper is greatly need for my students to complete much of their work. With all the state cutbacks in education, receiving grants from generous organizations is in great need for our classroom to continue to teach our students. This project is important so that the students have the supplies needed for day-to-day activities. All students will have the same supplies and no one will feel left out. We are asking for lined paper, colored copy paper, sticky notes, take-home folders and pens. Please consider donating to my classroom's project as it will really help the students that will be in my class next year. This will allow all of the students to start off on equal ground for their education. This will also allow me, as a teacher, to supply my class with the classroom work that they need to further their education.

What if you did not have access to your own printer? First, my students are amazing. They are resilient, hard working, enthusiastic, and they love to learn. Most of them come from an undeserved community-- high poverty, violent neighborhoods, and a lack of access to technology and computers. Our school is a Title 1 school in North Charleston, SC, and it is truly a wonderful place to learn and teach. In our Personal Mastery classroom, we set high expectations of independent learning, and students practice solving problems themselves. This process is slowed when, I, the teacher, have to be in control of what is printed (papers, projects, research articles, etc). Our goal is be as paperless as possible without putting kinks in a student's personal learning experience. So- students will use this paper and ink in the STUDENT ONLY printer station. If they need to print an article and annotate, this is where they can do that. If they need to print a paper or creative piece of writing for editing, they have a space to do so (without having to ask me for help). I have a printer. My students need paper and ink to go with it. This STUDENT ONLY printer station will allow students to practice and strengthen independent problem solving skills. It will give them more control over their learning, reading, and writing.

We just need to find our medium and style. The majority of my students have never even touched clay before. My aim is to widen their horizon with another medium to work with and help them find their artistic style I consider myself lucky because I get to teach all of the students in my school. Our students range from 4K to 5th grade, and we also have two wonderful Autism spectrum classes, which are split by grade level. Though it is a small school, we have a lot of diversity which makes for a fun, well-rounded educational setting. The students hold a wide array of interests and hobbies. Each child has a distinct personality which really shines through in each work of art they create. I love watching them work and use creative problem solving to fit their own style and ideas into the artwork they are working on. I am so inspired every day watching them work. I personally feel that my students and I are very fortunate, because though we may not have a large budget, we have a school that shares my philosophy that each child has their own unique style and should be allowed to express that. Each child is taught the same techniques and materials, but are allowed to interpret it in their own way. The exact artwork they will be creating will vary by grade level, but I want my students to build their fine motor skills and learn the three basic hand building techniques: pinching, coiling, and slabs. The upper grades will learn to score and slip as well. I will also be focusing on mosaics with 5th grade and we will be creating a collaborative mosaic on a wall in the garden outside of the Art Room. For every grade level, I will also be teaching about functionality of artwork. This is where the glaze is important. I want the students to understand that glaze isn't just for decoration, it also serves a purpose. It is the reason that they are able to eat and drink out of the clay cups and bowls they make in class. The Art Teacher before me left behind a kiln and a wonderful set of clay tools, but we have no clay or glaze to work with. The little budget I have is not enough to cover the cost of theses materials. The materials would mean the world to my students and me! Building with your hands is a very empowering experience. I want for my students to have the opportunity to build their fine motor skills and express themselves in a completely new and different way than they ever have before.

Research shows that integrating movement and music into the daily routine is a highly effective method of achieving learning for children from high poverty. My students are happy children who feel safe, and excited to come to school. Our school is the heart of our community. Each child is greeted in the morning by name as he or she enters the school. Our school is, for many of them, their place of peace. My students have big hopes and dreams for their futures and want to learn. Each child in my class feels valued and important. They count on me to deliver lessons that challenge them as individuals - and as a team. I work hard to ensure that all my students are working at their own ability level. If you were to visit our classroom, you would see how music and movement is used seamlessly throughout our day. My students and I use music for the purpose of unifying and building community, as well as for teaching and learning.

With the Ipod Touch and JBL speaker system, that valuable time is spared and student time is used effectively! Kindergarteners love exploring and enjoy sharing their knowledge with others. In addition to the ability to play music, other features of the Ipod Touch will enable my students to practice and grow by: capturing pictures of their work, recording themselves practicing their reading, and researching topics via the Internet. I am excited to think they would be able to use such an empowering piece of equipment! This Ipod Touch and JBL docking station will allow me to create playlists that can be easily accessed and rapidly available to be used in teaching: math, reading, writing, letter shapes, science, social studies, OT, and for having FUN!

They love saying 'hello' from different parts of the world. One of my challenges is to teach them about the world around them. This is one of many ways I teach multiculturalism. My students are bright five-year-olds. They love school and they love to learn. Often at my school I have to gather resources on my own to make the learning fun and relevant, but it is so worth it. When I see how engaged my students are in the learning, it's priceless. My school is in a low income community. All of the students qualify for free lunch. Many of my students live in the neighborhood. They consider the school, 'their school' and they absolutely love being there. My students and their parents know how important learning and being college and career ready is. At any point, you could come in my room and ask, 'What's more important than learning?' and they will reply, 'Nothing!' Another catch-phrase I say to them is, ' We're getting the knowledge..' and they respond, 'to go to college.' Beginning in Kindergarten, I want my students to already have the mindset they are going to college. I want them to learn about not just their community, but the World Community. These magazines are for kindergarten learners. These magazines allow my students to learn about the world around them in a fun, colorful, and inquisitive way. Two of the magazines infuse the learning around social studies topics that are engaging and current events. The science magazine will pique the interest of those little scientists in my classroom and nourish those inquisitive minds. My students will be able to read most of the magazine on their own. They will participate in group talks about what they have learned and ask questions about the information they read to their peers. What amazing book talks they could have around this nonfiction reading material. These magazines also teach map skills, geography, math, phonics, and many comprehension strategies. Funding this project will allow me to teach my students about the world around them using colorful, kid-friendly, and inviting photographs. They will see students the same age as them, in different parts of the world, learning, living, and growing.

They come in every day with a smile, a positive attitude, and do everything they can to be successful in school! My class last year was particularly fond of all Mo Willem's books. I could not get ahold of enough of these books to get their reading appetites satisfied. To say they were obsessed is an understatement. There were rarely any available in our library because they always checked them out. They knew exactly where to go to find them on the shelf. Most of these kids had come in not knowing who Mo Willems was. Throughout the year they had formed an obsession and wanted to be just like him. This led to some amazing opportunities for my kids. We did author studies and studied his writing style as well as his illustrations. The children created their own books in Willems style. The books also served as great read-alouds and gave the children so many opportunities to practice emotions and voice when reading.

Their parents are not literate in English and many families lack the resources to help their child succeed. School becomes a safe haven and miracle location for my students to have a safe and encouraging environment to expand their constantly growing minds. I do my best to provide my students with all of the resources they need but at times cannot provide as well as I wish I could. My students deserve the very best that our school can offer to make them successful learners! My students need eight sets of headphones, 40 journals and a case of paper to improve literacy and writing skills. Journals- These journals will provide my students the chance to complete a daily journal writing on a topic of the students choice. This will allow them to apply the writing skills that they learned in an authentic writing piece. The design of these journals will allow the students the opportunity to illustrate their journal entry as well as demonstrates how their skills have developed over time. Stamp- This stamp will allow me to stamp the students journals each day to record the date of their journal entries/ Headphones- With two classroom computers and a listening center, headphones will allow my students to listen to stories and to participate in educational technology resources and stay focused without interrupting the education of the other students. Paper- Paper will allow me to print enrichment and intervention materials to assist my students in learning. It will help me to provide them with worksheets and homework assignments to practice the skills that I teach them. This project will improve my classroom by giving my students the resources they need to be successful students. These materials will allow them the opportunity to grow as learners and to have all necessary resources available at their fingertips. Reading and writing is so important for students to learn and this project will help my students to become successful readers and writers.

In 9th and 10th grade English, I'm pushing them to express themselves, explore their ideas, and learn more about themselves through their writing. To do this, they need to have one place to keep all of their thoughts - a comp book. My students are amazing. They come from all over the world, and have experienced more than I can imagine. They have powerful stories to tell, and in my class, I'm trying to help them find their voices. They are funny, insightful, and more worldly than I ever was when I was their age. But they also have a lot working against them - many are migrants or refugees; most are low-income; our building lacks some of the basic necessities. We talk a lot about the adversity we experience and see, and how that makes us who we are. My goal as their language arts teacher is to help them find out more about who they are, what they've experienced, and how their stories can change those around them. It's daunting for all of us, but exciting when a student realizes that she isn't just doing a writing assignment, but instead is telling something personal and teaching me about her. We use comp books as a 'writers' notebook.' This is a space that's entirely the student's: it's personalized, and will end up holding all of the work that they'll do for the whole year. At times I'll ask them to write very specific things; other times, it will be a space dedicated to free writes, opinions, ideas, and reservations. A writer's notebook is critical for writers, regardless of their level, and we want our students to start embracing their identities as writers early on. Therefore I am asking for composition notebooks, folders in which to store the books, and pencils for writing.A writer's notebook is critical for writers, regardless of their level, and we want our students to start embracing their identities as writers early on.

Both groups of students will be striving to stay on green, to earn a trip to the treasure box. This means we will need lots and lots of treasure box rewards!

4b42871a81be25fbff78c16d84afeb77,The Value of Curiosity and Choice Chambers,"As I embark on my second year of teaching high school science, I am filled with excitement, anticipation, and a sense that I carry a heavy burden. Since many of my students will have me as their science teacher for three to four years in a row, I am solely responsible for their opinion of science. I teach at a small school in a rural agricultural community burdened with poverty. Our students grow up in single-parent homes with more mouths to feed than food on the table. Education is not valued, and it seems as if our students cannot imagine a reality in which they do not rely on government support. They are the victims of generational poverty, and my fellow educators and I are tasked with teaching them how to become productive citizens and break that cycle. As a science teacher, I feel like my role is to teach students how to ask relevant questions and determine how to answer those questions. One of the biggest themes of my classes is the importance of inquiry. Curiosity has been a major catalyst for scientific discovery, and I like to foster curiosity by allowing my students to design and carryout their own experiments. One type of experiment students can easily relate to is animal behavior. A choice chamber allows students to present an organism with several different choices and determine their preferences. For example, my students may collect pill bugs and determine what roll they play in an ecosystem by figuring out what they like to eat. When students ask their own question, design their experiment, then seek to answer that question, they are not only learning about science, they are becoming scientists. Students will then record their experimental process, show their data analysis, and present it to the class using the chart paper. Students become more confident and capable as they present their experiments throughout the year. When we celebrate curiosity and let students know they have a voice, an important opinion, we build up their self worth. When we equip students to identify relevant questions, use the scientific process to answer those questions, and confidently share their findings with their peers, we are promoting ownership and responsibility. I hope these skills and traits will help our students solve real world problems when they're no longer in the classroom.

c317d493ad9814e7a840785ab4cbbbd3,Inner-City Puppet Theater,"Our art room houses several iterations of visual art. 1st and 2nd hour is usually basic Art 1 and 2. 3rd hour is usually Video Production. By 4th hour we are either doing Digital Photography, Graphic Design or Art Appreciation/Art History. 7th hour is the new and experimental Puppet Making class. My students are from Flint, MI and the surrounding counties. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. Many of my students come from poverty stricken areas and households. This is the single factor that most of my students have in common. We are about 85% free and reduced lunches. Many come from violent environments, broken and unstable home environments. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. Students who are openly homosexual, pregnant, extremely intelligent, or socially awkward make up a large portion of the student body. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to extremely empathetic to others. We pride ourselves in being involved in our community! The two items I am requesting are specifically for our new puppet theater that we are starting this year. We will be producing both indoor and outdoor productions. The puppets will range in size from 3 feet to parade style puppets which are sometimes up to 20 feet. Our first show will be this December. It is about dreams. The show will combine live puppetry, shadow puppetry, video, live music, recorded music, lighting, sound design, narration and a smoke machine I hope! Our main puppets are in the style of Japanese Bunraku puppets as well as European Marionette Portee style puppets. This means that the puppets are very high in artistic style and creativity. These are not Muppet style. Most of the puppets will take 3 students to operate. One for the head and arm, one for the back and other arm and one for the legs. Since we will be utilizing video and overhead projections as well as live music, narration and sound effects we are in desperate need of a movie screen and a sound system. Our intention is for our students to be able to tell stories relevant to their lives. Puppets are a great way for our particular student body to express themselves in a unique way. Controlling a puppet also takes some of the stigma of performance away from an otherwise nervous young actor. Helping to support our Puppet Theater will directly impact the lives of hundreds of inner-city youth and their families but also the wider Flint community.

My 60+ third graders attend a Title I (low socioeconomic) school in Texas. We have a wide range of students, including those who come from middle class families to those whose parents struggle to make ends meet. Despite their diversity, ALL of my students are inquisitive learners and hard workers. As their math teacher, I love working with them and watching them discover how mathematics is an integral part of their everyday life. We received a printer through donorschoose.org last year, but printers require ink. And with the new school year here, we are in need of more ink! Having ink means that I can print colorful foldables and anchor charts for my students' interactive math notebooks. I can also create more activities and games for Math Workshop. We are also in need of a VGA Manual Switch Box. We received an iPad stand through donorschoose.org last year as well, which has allowed me, the teacher, to use my district-provided iPad as a document camera. That has been a huge help in the classroom, allowing all of my students to see the lesson for the day. Currently, to switch back and forth between the iPad and computer when using the projector, I am constantly unplugging and plugging back in. Not only is it a waste of class time, but it often messes up the display--sometimes not working at all! Having the VGA switch box would allow me to connect both pieces of technology without all of the mess. My classroom has been blessed by the generosity of the donorschoose.org community, and having received various resources has made a huge difference in both my teaching and my students' learning. What we are asking for now would allow us to continue to use what we already have in a more efficient and effective manner. I don't want my students to live in a black and white world in my classroom, and with your help, these supplies will help them see rainbows.

They love to read books on their own and they gain so much confidence in their reading ability when they can read a book by themselves. I would love to have a wide variety of books for them to choose from. This will help them gain more exposure to books and hopefully continue their growth in their reading ability.

These books are used for independent reading time in class. Independent reading time is a time frame where students are reading on their own, with a purpose. I conference with students independently and am able to discuss reading strategies with the students. By building the classroom library, students have more books to use during independent reading time and continue to grow as independent readers.

When all you want to do is put your left leg in and shake it all about? I teach first grade. It is difficult for a first grader to sit still for long periods of time. And let's face it, should a first grader really sit still for that long? Hokki stools provide constant movement while the student 'sits' to complete work or explore concepts. The movement of the stool promotes physical well-being and balance to encourage a healthy lifestyle. These stools also promote intellectual well-being as the constant movement helps students focus. My students need three Hokki stools to provide movement and promote health in terms of both intellectual and physical well-being. A hokki stool is designed to give the person sitting on it constant slight movement. This helps the child get the movement they need while sitting at their seat.

In total, our school consists of 810 students, 150 of which are in fourth grade. Half of the teachers on our seven person team teach math and science, while the other half teach reading and writing (our seventh teacher is self-contained, teaching all subjects). We are appreciative of the generous parents we have at our school, many of whom offer much of their time and support. Imagine a classroom where reading is a priority and giving time to read, lots of time to read, is carved into each day. Students in our classes spend at least 30 minutes per day reading books they select on their own and are interested in. Experts say that a classroom library should have enough books to equal at least 20 per student. Because we have seven classes of readers, this would mean that our fourth grade would need over 3,000 books between our four classroom libraries to truly meet the needs of our readers. Each week, our students select new books to read. These books need to be of high interest to them as well as on their level. Having access to a wide variety of appropriate level and high interest books will aid our students on their journey to becoming lifelong lovers of reading.

We have a very diverse group of learners in our district. Many of the students I work with have very little support from home and come to school seeking structure and a helping hand. When the students are given hands-on materials to create with they get excited about the activity and forget that they are learning. They quickly are engaged and ready to write, read or discuss ideas when they have their project in front of them that they just created. If every topic can be attached to a hands-on project then these students are unstoppable! With these Quill materials we will be able to accomplish several activities. The bulletin board materials will be a great visual connection for the students during our Dr Seuss celebration unit. Students start to engage in discussions about the stories and make connections to stories they have read by Dr Seuss. The fish bank will be a craft related to the fish in the Dr Seuss stories. We will us the banks for storing rhyming words we learn, and descriptive writing pieces will be written about the fish they have created. They will also be carried over to our math unit involving money.

My goal is to teach students to use technology and for them to use it to learn and teach those around them. Using the newest technology to do this will ensure that these students are ready for the real world- and ahead of their peers. Our school is a new charter school in Asheville, NC with an amazing vision. My classroom consists of 3 groups of the most amazing 4th and 5th graders I've ever met. Altogether about 90 kids come through the door each day. These kids are ready to learn and want (and deserve!) to use technology to do so. The projector, speakers, and Bamboo tablet (and accessories) will be used for me to present information in an interactive and engaging way. The students will also use these items to present what they learn with projects we complete throughout the year. The students will use the iPads to research and practice what we learn. These items will make research possible at school. Currently there isn't a way for students to get online. Being able to see and hear what is projected will make the lessons more interactive and fun.

It is located in the East Rogers Park area of the City of Chicago. 95% of the students population receives free or reduced lunch. Because of this, money is spent on the necessities and not on technology. This means my students do not have the same access to technology in the classroom as other schools and other students. My middle school students are eager to learn and excited to share what they have already learned. Technology in the classroom provides us with endless opportunities to both share what we have learned and to continue to learn. My goal is to prepare my middle school students for what comes after they leave my classroom and this school. In order to do that I must provide them with the tools and the opportunities to use technology on a regular basis. My Middle School students will use these Chromebooks in varying ways throughout the school year. For example, they will be able to use publication programs and software to create and publish their written work. They will be able to access the Internet, where they can conduct research, practice skills, review concepts, and learn new material. With this type of technology available at all times, my students will have access to a wide range of resources that will enhance learning and further understanding in all content areas. Students will also have an opportunity to learn how to properly use the internet to gain a perspective of the global community in which they live.

Their learning, due to language barriers, needs to involve technology (visuals) to help them close the learning gap. Learning needs to be hands-on. Hands-on requires technology. As mentioned above, the majority of our students are from war-torn countries and their families have come to the United States for better opportunities and education. Most are on free and reduced lunch and their time in school is extremely important because that is where we can help them as most of them do not have the support at home due to the language barrier.

We really need to use technology: visuals, examples - that can only be found online. Our school is a K-12 and we do have technology (slightly older) but to spread it between 8 grades is difficult. Often times we cannot use them because they are being used for assessments. To have a set in my classroom to use in World History - as well as my college readiness class (to do projects on careers and colleges) would help the learning immensely. I would, of course, share with the other teachers when not using them. The students are so eager! My AVID - college readiness - students will use the computers to research colleges and careers as well as complete projects. Last year they held a college fair and presented the information to the students in the lower grades and it really helped to unite the school and form a community as all the students get to know each other. Learning will be reinforced and the laptops can be used in a variety of ways to help a variety of students in multiple grades.

The kids actually enjoy practicing because it seems like a game! Motivation is a critical component of learning. These iPads are highly prized by the students and they will be eager to spend time practicing their math facts when they have access to this technology.

I will help students find e-books to check out from the local library, thus using our limited resources to stretch what we can offer our students. Students will be able to read at their level, without any social stigma of having a book that looks uncool or too young. The Kindle provides support for struggling readers in many ways, notably an integrated dictionary, text-to-voice read aloud feature for unknown words, and adjustable font size. Initial research in the field also indicates that the 'cool' factor of reading with new technology can increase students' motivation, especially when supported by a librarian who can help them find just right books to read. As the school librarian, I often see myself as a cheerleader for reading. But I know many of my students struggle with reading and hate checking out books at their level-- especially if that means books that seem too short, too young, and definitely not cool. My goal is to help all kids find books that make them want to read. Ian, who loves graphic novels but doesn't always sink into a novel, said, 'I like the feel of reading on the Kindle. It makes me want to read more.' Hooray!! ","My students need 10 Kindles, covers, and adapters to support and engage reluctant readers.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Technology,1831.56,Expired

I am hoping to show my students that some of those great secrets can be found inside wordless picture books. It is my honor and privilege to be able to teach a group of 27 highly motivated and intelligent first grade students in Illinois. We are a Title 1 school in a high poverty area. For a majority of my students, English is their second language. It is my goal to provide my students with every opportunity for success. In this case, I want to help them grow into competent readers by helping them establish a solid literacy foundation and a love for books. That is where wordless picture books come in! For some of my students, there is nothing more frustrating than picking up a book that is too hard to for them read or a book that is falling apart. At first glance, it might appear that wordless picture books are simple stories, when in reality, they are very complex. Wordless books are perfect for introducing new vocabulary, improving oral language skills and developing higher-level thinking skills. They are perfect for students of all ability levels, not to mention the fun and enjoyment my students get when reading them. Their confidence will soar when they see that everyone can read! The books I have selected like, Hank Finds an Egg and Journey, will promote creativity and spark the imagination of my first graders. They will also help me show my students that everyone in our classroom is a reader... even if they are only using the pictures to tell the story.

We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We strive to help every student to meet their needs. We provide additional materials and health services if needed. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We instituted academic clubs after school, and pull-out programs to reinforce academics. Because of these additional programs, our students have done well on standardized tests. We have developed a recipe for success. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. I requested colored paper and markers to help start a superior art program at the beginning of the year. We are lacking in basic supplies. The supplies will help a special weaving project and many other projects throughout the year. The students will learn the need for 'weaving through many lands.' Students will feel connected though their cultures. They will be able to create beautiful paper Kente cloths and learn the meaning behind them. Students will make Mexican paper weaving influenced by Mexican Zapotec rugs and blankets. These weaving will have symbols and patterns created by the markers requested. They will also use twigs and pipe cleaners to make beautiful weaving influenced by Haitian weaving of baskets and displays. Some students will weave using twigs linking their weaving to birds weaving nests. The materials requested will help provide an exciting weaving unit and help fund future art projects. Students will synthesize connections with their heritages through the arts. They will explore many reasons for weaving. Most birds weave nests so their nests do not get blown away.

Incorporating technology through tablets allows the world to be readily available and will deepen our students thinking while learning. My students are wonderful second graders who are eager to learn. They come from a wide variety of racial and language backgrounds and almost fifty percent of them qualify for free or reduced lunch. Some have access to computers at home but many are only exposed to technology at school. Some travel to Europe for a long weekend and some do not know where their next meal is coming from. The disparity is vast in Berkeley and the classroom is the bridge for all students. This year we have fully implemented Common Core State Standards. We are in need of technology within our rooms that easily used and accessible to young children. My goal is for our students to be able to use ipads to support evidence based thinking through technology that is user friendly. Ipads allow for young children to research topics of interest and access any skill work they may need through apps and web sites. My students are excited about learning and are always looking for more ways to expand their knowledge. In the classroom we often need to practice math facts, a way to research topics, and often have a need to answer questions immediately so we can then think deeply about the world around us. If my students could easily access the world through technology, it would increase their general knowledge about the world they live in. Our students would have extra opportunities for use of educational websites. My overall goal would be to have the students rotate on to the ipads as one of their daily learning centers. If a student needs additional help with math, but excels in language arts, there will be apps that allow for that student to practice math facts. Ipads also provide opportunities for students to explore science, writing and social studies with sites like Mobymax.com. This site individualizes content areas for students so they can expand the individual learning in any area they choose. It also provides the teacher with immediate feedback on each student's progress. Motivation is a critical component of learning. These ipads are highly prized items by my students. This technology will make them eager to practice their math facts, research topics, or answer questions they have while reading.

The students range from homeless to living in a private country club. 30% are African American, 30% are Hispanic, and 30% are white. The students will read A Long Walk to Water. It aligns with their social studies and language arts curriculum. This novel will teach students about identify and social conflict through a globally relevant topic. While also focusing on necessary reading comprehension and common core standards. Students will explore the experiences of people of Southern Sudan during and after the Second Sudanese Civil War. They will build proficiency in using textual evidence to support ideas in their writing, both in shorter responses and in an extended essay. As students begin the novel, A Long Walk to Water, they will read closely to practice citing evidence and drawing inferences from this compelling text as they begin to analyze and contrast the points of view of the two central characters, Salva and Nya. They also will read supplemental informational text to gather evidence on the perspectives of the Dinka and Nuer tribes of Southern Sudan. This novel will provide insight into global awareness and teach middle schoolers about the importance of individual identity. It also lends itself to an easy alignment between social studies and language arts, which in turn will assist in decreasing the reading gap and bridging the two subjects.

My students will listen to a story about Alexander Calder, discuss, and view samples of his 3-d wire works and mobiles for inspiration. Some classes will make mobiles using colored pipe cleaners wires, and beads to create fish. Other classes will make 3-d standing stationary sculpture which are called stabiles. They will make the stationary sculptures with shapes and wires representing wried sculptures that Alexander Calder was famous for. They will be colorful and mounted on the poster board. Students will be exposed to a famous artist Alexander Calder and learn another style of art by creating wire sculpture. They will use a kinesthetic approach of creating a 3-d sculpture.

Imagine the delight on their faces at having the resources they use during their daily centers in color when all they have previously had has been in black and white! You can only imagine the motivation that color can bring! My kindergarten classroom is filled with a wide range of energetic students--from those who have had minimal experiences in their lives to those who have had many. They are eager to learn and greet each new experience with enthusiasm! We are part of an awesome school community in Kansas that works very hard to meet the needs of each student in spite of continuing budget cuts. As a teacher, I have spent much of my personal money on classroom resources through online accounts such as TeachersPayTeachers, Mailbox and Scholastic. Much to my dismay I then discovered that many of those resources needed to be printed in color to make them usable in the classroom. Having access to a color printer, card stock to print on and ink refills for sustainability will finally allow us to use the resources purchased as they were intended. This will allow my students to learn more effectively as they will have colorful resources for centers, literacy and math games, and writing activities as a part of their daily learning experiences. Seeing this project fulfilled will add the motivation that color can bring into a classroom. My students will be able to use materials as the learning tools they were intended to be. We will not have to spend precious learning time 'coloring in pictures' to get resources ready to be used, but rather will be able to use our learning time wisely.

They love working on computers and shrill with excitement everyday their name is called to work on words. Because I only have two computers for 28 kids, they aren't able to use technology as much as they would like (or I would like). Ipads are wonderful learning tools that engage students in a variety of ways. They excite, motivate and inspire kids to learn a variety of subjects. The apps available for free is AWESOME. Students will engage in early reading skills such as letter naming, hearing letter sounds, tracing letters, rhyming, working on sight-words, counting, solving math equations, and reading. Not only will we utilize the apps, but iPads are a great tool to record students' reading abilities and then play it back to them to reflect on how they have grown as readers. They also would be utilized for me to assess current reading levels using the DRA program. Completing these on the iPads would save our school paper and ink as we would update our paper-pencil record keeping to digital. 'Every Child Succeeds.'

That is how it was for my first graders when I introduced them to the Elephant and Piggie series by Mo Willems. They so love Piggie and her friend Gerald that the characters feel like two more kids in our classroom! I teach at a public alternative school. The literacy workshop curriculum keeps the students active and engaged. Like every primary teacher, my class includes kids who are already reading, as well as kids who are just dipping their feet in the water. It is for this latter group, in particular, that I am requesting a Donors Choose grant. I hope to buy a large set of these magical books that kids won't put down! I hope you'll come on board with me! Beginning readers confidently read what each character is saying because they have learned their personalities and ways of interacting. Pictures of them and their talking balloons have started surfacing in the students' drawings and I have even heard familiar exchanges during the kids' spontaneous drama. I knew we were on to something good, but unfortunately, there are not enough books in the classroom or library to satisfy this thirst. I want to use the Elephant and Piggie books in Readers Theater activities with students to help them build confidence and voice as readers. A larger collection of them can increase their use as take home, read-aloud-to-family books, because they are books these kids are dying to read aloud. When the occasional book is left at home, the other kids will not feel so disappointed. Elephant and Piggie will also contribute to my students' growth as writers, as the kids are already drawing these beloved characters and captioning their conversations with speech bubbles modeled after those in the texts. More copies spread out on the tables will invite them to add words they have memorized, or copy words that express what they want to say. Sight words will serve the greatest purpose (rather than flashcard practice), rounded out with best guess spelling that builds phonics knowledge and fluency with writing. In short, Elephant and Piggie (and the Pigeon) inspire, and inspired readers are fearless readers. Because my children believe in and love the voices of these characters and their friends (yes, there is a snake, a bat, a bird...), they are building their own voices as readers in order to spend time with these characters, and then extending that inspiration in writing.

My first graders are just beginning to develop their reading skills, and they LOVE to listen to books on CD. Students need to hear a story come alive and see it unfold in their hands. What better way than with a listening center? The children in my district come from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. All the children have the desire to learn. Some, do not have the family support necessary to encourage success. My students want to be cared about and want positive reinforcement for their good deeds. Our school tries to provide the children with a 'family' style atmosphere, hoping that each child thrives in his/her life. My students will have the opportunity to go to the listening center and listen to stories that they cannot yet read independently. Our listening center will help support reading fiction and nonfiction books (books about what we learn in science and social studies). It will also help students improve reading fluency and comprehension. Students will rotate through our centers and listen/read along with the stories and then respond to the book in writing. This listening center can also be used for 'early finishers' and as a reward for great behavior. The best part of this project is that it will benefit my current students as well as my future students! This project will ensure that my students are exposed to different types of literature, thus instilling in them a love of reading!

9bec4e7c81e8c5fc0a8d46ec8fb37289,Puppet Theatre Lighting,"Our puppet theatre troupe is filled with students who are innovators, engineers, artists, performers, musicians and craftsmen. Right now a typical day involves learning movement, breath and teamwork, building practice puppets, sculpting heads, making masks, painting props, paper mache work and more. My students come from all walks of life. Our school accepts students from the entire county and we have a very high percentage of students from inner-city Flint. Our school truly has a diverse population. Our city has been hit hard with poverty and that does transfer into the classroom in many forms. My students tend to be quite creative but lack the experience of having the arts offered at their previous schools. They can be challenging, hilarious, smart, caring, empathetic and kind. One thing that does set our school apart is our commitment and involvement in the community. We have a great reputation in our town. We are considered an alternative to a traditional high school. This means that we have many non-traditional students, students that do not fit your typical mold. We are an early college and a middle college. Students start taking college in their 9th grade year and stay a 5th year in order to get more college credits and a potential Associates degree. With a lighting system we will be able to present our high school puppet theatre called 'Fli-Town Puppet Theatre'. We need lights to be able to present the atmosphere that is needed for a puppet show to be truly engaging, artistic, dramatic and fun. Our puppet theatre is new this year. One thing that is important to us is to be able to be portable. We want to share our shows with our community as well as other schools. The lighting system that we are trying to get funded is light, portable, isn't hot and dangerous, and is made up of new technology that is beneficial for our students, especially if they are planning to get into any part of entertainment or theatre. They will learn how to focus lights, change colors, fade in and out, design a lighting set up for specific spaces. They will learn what it means to be a gaffer, a technician, the artistry around lighting design, power, electricity and more. And of course what it means to put on a play and present puppets to our community. If we are able to get our project funded it will directly impact our ability to present a high quality theatrical puppet play. Our puppet theatre does not use a traditional Muppet style puppet. We are making European style puppets mixed with traditional Japanese Bunraku style. This means we have 2 to 3 students controlling each puppet. For them to come to life we need a controlled lighting set up to allow us to camouflage our actors on stage bringing attention to the puppets themselves.

b9c058d4923f04e9cf4138f3f5960e70,Helping Students Focus and Achieve,"We do all we can to use technology in our curriculum, though many of our students cannot afford a set of headphones. When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

These students have been faced with a lot but never give up a challenge. These students come from different backgrounds. They enjoy coming to school and are always eager to learn. We just need more resources to help them be able to do so. Our school is a Title One school which means that 70% or more of our students receive free/reduced lunch. Kids with special needs tend to be very sensory. We see this a lot in our classroom. Our kids need to have sensory items available for them to hold and I will admit, I don't have a lot of these items available when needed. Our students tend to fidget and become unfocused after periods of time. Having these sensory items available will not only help to increase time on task but they will also help with behavior management as well. Some items will reinforce strategies taught during class as well. Students will be able to hold these items and be more focused on what is being taught. The sensory bar desk buddies will be an item for students to touch while doing their work. The letter formation tray and tactile sand numbers will help with students who are sensory and are still learning their letters and numbers. The sensory balls will be another item for kids to hold. The gel boards will help with the writing and the shoes will help with tying shoes. Donations will to this project will help our students to be more successful in and out of the classroom. Because of your donation, our students will be able to have more resources to help them learn in the classroom.

Some of my students are better at math, others love science or sports but they all arrive excited and ready to learn every day. Everyone's learning has its own time-table. I have students who catch on like lightening while others who are just as enthusiastic need extra examples or some individual help. I have 11 who are new to the program this year so it would be very helpful to have mini-ipads available for the ones who finish early. They could visit webpages I have created for the class, play games in German or visit some of the many children's educational websites available in German while I work with small groups or individuals. Some of our families do not have Internet access at home so this would be a good opportunity for those students to experience using to internet to reinforce their learning. The amount of comprehensible input a learner processes is directly correlated to his/her level of success. In other words, the more German I can give them in meaningful and interesting ways, the better their proficiency will be.

My students and I have decided to do a monthly service project to give to those in need. I want to give back to my class by having this project fully funded this month. I teach 27 fourth graders in a fabulous school. Our mission statement states, 'We are building stronger minds, bodies, and spirits together.' I think this applies to everything we do. Each year our school makes donations to Make-a-Wish, Pennies for Patients, Animal Shelters, Zoos, and many other organizations. We are a hard working, dedicated, and caring community striving to make the world a better place one act of kindness at a time. We know that our actions will ripple throughout the community. Please bring some joy to your life and join us in our efforts! This project would allow us to create sign ups, share our community service pictures, and find more organizations in need. Thus far we have planned, blanket and food donations around the holidays, animal shelter donations, visits to a local nursing home, treats for our local heroes (police, firefighters, military), and care packages overseas. In order to complete all of these tasks, we are going to need this project fully funded. You could be a part of our ripple of kindness. We have requested items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, granola bars, and soap to make care packages to donate to homeless shelters. We have requested pre-made care packages with snacks for our heroes in our local community (police, firefighters, etc) and for our heroes overseas (our American soldiers fighting for our freedoms). We are truly grateful to have the resources to be able to provide these service projects to make our world a better place and bring a smile. There's no better feeling in the world! We believe that bullying doesn't exist when students are working together to better the lives of those around them. Each act of kindness is a small reminder of how we are working as a team to build a stronger community. And we do have to work together for this to succeed.

We are an Open School where students are taught to be critical thinkers and give their own voice to each project they embark on. Hard working, enthusiastic, and extremely joyful, they devour all arts opportunities presented to them. They LOVE to create and perform and jump at the chance to share their creations. 'Orff Instruments' (in this project, xylophones) are specifically designed for elementary and middle school use. Students not only use them to learn and accompany known songs and pieces, but more importantly to create their own arrangements, compositions, and solos. They are a fabulously accessible instrument that allows all students to participate in music making. They also help dramatically in differentiation- students and the teacher can tailor learning to the needs of each student by making the music as simple or complex as appropriate. Students will perform large pieces in an ensemble, accompany songs in the classroom, and create their own arrangements and compositions. The general music program at our school is being rebuilt from the ground up- we started the year with an empty room. With extremely limited funds we are not able to purchase these, or many other, instruments and classroom supplies. Ideally, someday we will have one instrument for each student in the class.

They will also be able to read the text independently and create a project based on what they have read and learned. This will teach the students responsibility because they take learning into their own hands. The learning is student centered and fun!

(Bickart, Jablon, & Dodge 1999). This quote shows the importance and value of center/stations in the classroom. My students are excited to learn. They have great attendance and love coming to school! At school they are safe, encouraged, and supported. Sadly, our inner city school has been labeled high priority by our state. Our test scores are just not good enough. We also have over 90% free and reduced lunch and many homeless and highly mobile students. But, my students are eager to succeed in learning and life! To keep my students engaged and excited about learning we do stations. During stations, small groups of students spend time working on a specific skill, like phonics. Twenty minutes later, we rotate to a new station to practice another skill, vocabulary. The same is true for math, students rotate from working on money, to telling time, to using numbers. Stations allow students to practice multiple skills, and work cooperatively with others. Using stations, I am able to meet with smaller groups of students or even one on one to reach students who need extra support in a given area. Stations provide a predictable routine for students, with embedded cooperative learning skills, and academic challenge. My students love stations! They love the easy rotation structure and routine in the classroom. One thing they are missing is a little more fun! The student are kind and act like they don't mind my old dice, or different worksheets, but I know they would love some more engaging activities. These puzzle will totally engage my students in their learning activities. They will be completely 'tricked' into learning and practicing many new skills. I can't wait to see the look on their faces!

They come from all backgrounds and there are at least three languages spoken in my classroom. They are full of energy and excitement for learning. For many of my students, school is what they most look forward to in their daily lives. The students will use the iPads to learn math, writing, reading, and art skills. They will also be using the internet to learn about the world around us. The use of modern technology will make whatever we are learning about more engaging and exciting for my students.

My students get very excited when I am able to bring new technology into the classroom. It gets them excited about learning. We do centers for 30 minutes each day. I feel bad because most of the time the students are working on paper centers that I have printed off the Internet and laminated. This listening center will give them a center to be excited about, and give them something to look forward to each day. I am asking for a CD player with multiple headphones and jacks so that 5-6 students can listen to books being read to them. I am also asking for 8 sets of 4-5 books with CD's so the students can follow along as the story is read to them and a container for each book so that it can bee kept organized. It will make my students better readers. It will also help boost their vocabulary through the books. It will improve their comprehension skills as well, because they will not have to focus so much on sounding out the words. They will then be able to focus on the content in the story.

It's important to give them something they can identify with and connect to their own world. The school consists of 95% English Language Learners which presents special challenges. Students read at a variety of levels, from non-English beginners to grade-level proficient. They love reading! The school district, serving low-income families, has a limited budget, and it is up to teachers to find ways to provide even the basics of the classroom.

These high-interest books will also give them the practice navigating through different types of books. Additionally, they'll be able to share book experiences with others in accordance with the Common Core Learning Standards. When I look at the books we grew up with, I think of 'Fun with Dick and Jane.' We have come a long way! It's time to show the kids how fun reading can be. Providing a variety of books will strengthen their self-esteem as they read about characters they can relate to.

We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past six years, our small program has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. As the program continues to grow, we would also like to have a logo t-shirt that will help us identify our students while traveling, and give them a sense of pride in the program that they have worked so hard to be part of. This year, a dedicated group of students will be traveling throughout Japan. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the economic structure of an international superpower, compare the education system with that of our own, and strengthen their interview and public speaking skills by shadowing employers in a variety of markets, most notably commerce and technology.

Instruction in functional academics and life skills helps students increase independence and prepare for real life situations. At times, though, a student's sensitivity to loud noises and other things in the general school environment and community makes participation in these settings challenging. For my current students, music serves as a universal soother. Although each student has different music likes, covering their ears with their preferred music masks other environmental noises and helps them function better in the various settings. Music also serves as a high preference motivator. With mp3 players, students can discretely take music on the go.

Most students come to school for their breakfast, lunch and a snack. Even with the added pressure of food, all of my students are willing to learn. At my school we work hard to make sure all our students are able to succeed. Most of the time we spend our own money on little items to better our students experience at school. I am asking for a new listening station. My students love to listen to stories. It is a highlight of their day in Kindergarten. We are in desperate need of a new listening station because our current listening station broke. They have been so disappointed that they are unable to listen to their favorite stories. Listening to stories helps improve not only our listening skills but also our reading skills. We work on reading fluency, finding words we know, and retelling stories. With this new listening station my students will be able to listen to their favorite stories thus improving their reading fluency and reading skills.

Our school is located in a small city on the outliers of Charleston, SC. I have a classroom of 18 diverse but eager first graders. Although 90% of the students receive free or reduced lunch and live in a low socioeconomic are, it doesn't affect their enthusiasm for learning. I would love to reward their eager minds with a hands on learning experience that they may only experience at school. We need protective cases for our recently funded iPads. The students will use the protective cases for the iPads for everyday activities. They will be able to carry the iPads from place to place without the fear of scratching or causing damage to it. The cases will also be able to 'hold' the iPad while they relax and read. As far as the iPads, they use them throughout the day. They use them mainly for Daily 5 stations. They are also used for behavior management, as a reward. We will also use the iPads for research projects, class videos, and mathematics. There are endless possibilities for iPad uses in our classroom. An iPad in the classroom would help expose my students to manipulating math problems, reading on a computer screen, and typing out their writing. It will prepare them better for advanced grades, they will be more accustomed to technology. By implementing the iPads in the classroom, students are opened to countless learning opportunities. From reading to math to science or social studies. Our generation is currently in a technology world, why not accommodate them with what they know best in a safe way. With protective cases, the students will be able to move around the room without the fear of dropping an unprotected iPad. Kids will be kids, especially 18 first graders.

I teach 7th grade Texas history within a district that has not only a high mobility rate amongst the students, but a high turnover rate amongst the teachers. I use incentives for positive behavior through points they earn on Class Dojo. The majority of my students live below poverty. Our entire school receives free breakfast and lunch for the students. They come from single parent homes and foster care. Many of them are 3-4 years behind on their reading levels and most of them have never taken a history class before. I have over 10% of my students who are SPED, 504, Dyslexic or suffer from severe emotional disturbances. Additionally up to 40% of my students are classified as LEP or Limited English Proficiency. My school is plagued with frequent fighting, skipping classes and parents who do not involve themselves in their children's success. I need these books for more ideas on how to help my students and give them the opportunity to excel in spite of their circumstances. The other small items are used as prizes for a certain number of Class Dojo points which gives the kids something to work towards and to feel like they achieved something. My students come into class and know that if they work hard, answer questions, raise their hand before speaking, help around the classroom, treat each other with respect and work hard they will earn more and more points which they can then turn in for things which they want. We have to wear student IDs all day but the lanyards provided are very cheap and break easily, so the children would love the opportunity to earn new lanyards in their favorite colors as a ways of expressing themselves. This goes the same for the shoelaces, any sense of individuality they can have while in uniform is a huge incentive for them to exhibit positive behavior and respect. I've seen firsthand how giving my students incentives for good behavior has turned around their behavior for the better. I'm concerned that my inability to keep affording small prizes will hinder their desire to work hard and thus, their grades will not improve.

With this camera we can interface it with an IPad that allows the student to focus the camera, compose the image, adjust ISO, Aperture and shutter speed. It also allows them to fire the camera. The iPad gives them immediate feed back on how the image looks. Currently, the DSLR's we have are not advanced enough to run the adaptive device (a Cam-Ranger). This device will make a difference in my classroom in two ways. The first way is that it will make photography accessible to the physically challenged students I get each year.

Alice WalkerMy students come alive through the beautification of our school through gardening. As a veteran teacher at my high school, I wondered if beauty affected the learning process. This year I found out. I had an idea in my environmental science class. The students supported and jumped right in. Most come from broken homes and impoverished neighborhoods. Often times, school is the place where they can get away from their realities at home. Our school would be the perfect escape if they had something to look forward to. Our class is filled with seniors whom have yet to see their school at it's peak of success. There is a need for that success. As a teacher I wish for my students to bask in the beauty of awesomeness. I wish for them to start a legacy that will be passed on. I wish for them to return to their home and see how they have contributed to the success of their community. This starts with the beautification of our campus. Someone once planted some roses in our courtyards. The roses have not reached their full potential. Students will learn how to prune and care for our roses to make them thrive. We currently started a vegetable garden in a courtyard and used old planters in another area of our school to continue planting. We have been walking our water hose from one side of campus to another. A hose cart would be the perfect tool to make this process more efficient. Our water nozzle has broken and we are in need of another. We have been manipulating the water as it comes out of the hose by placing our thumb on the end of the spout. We are desperately in need of outdoor gardening soil and or manure. Our ground is not fertile. Students will learn the elements needed in soil to create a sustainable growing environment for plants and vegetables. They will also be able to participate in soil testing labs. Knowing that anonymous people are investing in their efforts will help change their attitudes toward people in life. The beautification of our school through gardening will allow the students to gain the hands on experience in agricultural studies. This will also be the catalyst of projects to come and future partnerships for our school as we move forward.

My classroom is comprised entirely of students with severe behavior issues across 3 grade levels. Included in my classroom are a number of students with severe ADHD and other behaviors that have greatly impacted their learning. These students do not respond to traditional pencil and paper learning. I teach in a self-contained classroom, my students come to me from around my district after they have struggled in their home school. The school that I am at has a staggeringly high poverty rate, and my entire room is comprised of high poverty students. Many of my students feel like they have been written off by every adult in their lives. They all desperately desire to learn, though, and are hungry for a chance to read. Throughout their lives they've been made to feel like learning is something that they never will be able to achieve, but they are passionate to prove those naysayers wrong. My hope with this project is to continue using an alternative way to engage my students in learning. Throughout my building, teachers are experimenting with technology as a way to reach some of our most reluctant learners, including students with severe ADHD. We are seeing tremendous success with unique forms of technology that students in our building have no opportunity to see at home. In our room we have 3 NOOKS and they are always being used. Students are always clamoring to use them, and I simply can't keep up with demand. Students who previously refused to read are reading entire novels and novel series.

In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the TEACHER is most important.' I could not agree more. As a third grade teacher and life-long learner, I encourage my students to explore and go beyond the walls of our classroom. My class of 13 boys and 11 girls is a lively one. This group of children is first kind and cooperative with one another. They set their personal academic goals, and respect individual starting points knowing our class objective is growth for all. Our school and district is quaint and clean. It is full of caring parents, staff, teachers, and administrators. We are not a wealthy district or community, but we make do. The kids greet me at the door each morning with a handshake and smile. They come ready to learn, yet teach me something new each day!The technology available to the students is limited and outdated. This restricts both my ability and theirs with regard to exposing and exploring all the wonderful things that lie beyond our little school, district, and community. Technology is not the be-all and end-all of education, but it can provide children with experiences that they might not otherwise have growing up in a small somewhat rural town. I am seeking an iPad with a protective case for my classroom. The protective case with 24 third graders is self-explanatory, but let me share with you the purpose of the iPad. Technology of today has opened the door to more resources than one can imagine for adults and children alike. On a daily basis, my children would be able to utilize various online literacy and math programs which are not available to them outside of the school. These programs support the struggling student, the 'average' student, as well as the student who is ready for the next step in their education. Having an iPad would allow more children the chance to engage in these learning opportunities. More importantly, an iPad in our classroom would provide children with the ability to listen to books while following along. This will build fluency, as well as expose the children to a wider variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction with their specific needs and interests taken into account. The addition of an iPad to our two classroom computers (each over two decades old) will not revolutionize my teaching, as I believe what Bill Gates has said, 'Technology is just a tool.

I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.' - Einstein My school is a school rich in both diversity and community. As in most schools, parents and teachers strive day in and day out to provide a nurturing, safe, enriching, meaningful school experience. However, the parents who send their children to us often have a unique struggle - providing the basics for the families' survival. Sadly, many families are faced with the incomprehensible reality of providing their children with clothing and food or providing them with school supplies. With the emergence of the PARCC exam and the technical demands it is placing on our school, the resources for the greater school community are being stretched even further. This often means no supplemental materials can be obtained. This is the main reason I am turning to Donors Choose. As both an educator and mother of two, I do not want any child's educational experience, especially his/her earliest ones, to be dampened by poverty. With the new demands of the Common Core Curriculum, I find many of my students are struggling with basic math and reading skills. Honestly, despite my absolute best efforts, they are falling behind. Several of my students have special needs and require a great deal of additional support and practice. I am asking for several games that would provide the opportunity to continually review previously learned math and reading concepts. Students learn best through hands-on experiences and 'play,' so I know these will be motivating and fun.

I am working hard to improve that situation by acquiring engaging formats like graphic novels and the TOON books. My school library is more than books on shelves. It is a place where students go to Think, Create, Share, and Grow! Cultivating resources that tie into creativity, play, and literacy will grow lifelong readers. I serve over 550 PreK through 4th grade students at a Title 1 school. Our diverse student body comes from six of the seven continents. They are joyful learners and readers that inspire me with their enthusiasm every day. Some have no access to the public library as their parents are not users. Many do not have their own books in their homes. Though they come to the library weekly as part of school, I am hoping to create opportunities for them to come after school and even over the summer. Library use improves literacy, curiosity, and life long learning. I am a big believer in graphic novels and other comic type materials. They serve to engage even the most reluctant readers - stories and characters that capture their imagination, illustrations that help facilitate comprehension and promote confidence in understanding. My husband was a comic shop owner. Many of his customers were people that struggled with reading until they found the format. With that passion, the time they spent in text increased and their ability and willingness to read grew exponentially. Many credit their academic success to their early passion for reading through comics. The TOON books I am trying to purchase will allow me to provide that same experience for my struggling students, many of whom are English Language Learners or receiving Special Education services. A circulating collection of these books for my library would put them in the hands of struggling readers.

I have told them that I want to inspire them. I want them to learn about a famous pop artist named Andy Warhol. I teach art to a wonderful group of k-5 students. They are sponges eager to soak up everything. When they see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know what the next art project is. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We have academic clubs and after school tutoring and daily academic pull-out programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements Andy Warhol was known for creating tomato soup can paintings along with creating art from everyday objects. I want my students to work in small groups. ESOL and ESE students will be paired within the groups. The groups will collaborate using books and iPads to explore the famous pop artist. Using critical thinking skills, students will discuss that everyday objects in life can be art. They will see the connections and need for jobs in the art field. Warhol was a commercial artist. They will be inspired from Warhol to make a creative new kind of soup label to market. The pencils and paper requested will help students write, discuss, and plan their work. The markers requested will help add the color needed for the designs. Perhaps it will be a can of Peanut Butter Soup with a dancing peanut. Maybe it will be Creamy Chocolate Soup. Students will enjoy learning about pop art, collaborating and creating a new pop art soup and label to market. I'm looking forward to sharing photographs. Students will learn about a famous artist and recreate his work in a creative way. Students will learn about commercial art and that there are many careers in art. They will learn that art is in everyday objects. By donating to this project you are helping bring enrichment and quality materials to the arts.

They need to see their futures can be limitless. This trip will help fuel those dreams. Seventy-five percent of my students are from a minority background, either first or second generation. Most of these students' families have no post-secondary education. Sixty percent of my school is receiving free-and-reduced lunch. A great majority of my students want to attend college, but they lack the family exposure to a wide variety of college or career options. These students have struggled to master the language of their new country, succeed in school, and adapt to their new home. These students have internalized the American Dream and long to explore the advantages that America has to offer. Many of my students see daily their parents struggling in low-paying jobs to make ends meet. These students long to break that cycle and move towards jobs that are both fulfilling and financially secure. They need exposure to new, exciting, and rewarding career options. My National Honor Society students will explore the Oklahoma City science museum with a guided tour that allows free time for students to explore exhibits that attract their attention. Once students have piqued their interest and realized the excitement that science can hold for them, they will be given a presentation on various careers that can be pursued in different scientific fields. Students will be motivated to take advanced courses in both math and science to equip them for college work. This trip is also coordinated with the school counselor who works intimately with students in supplying them with information about college choices including scholarship and grant materials. My students will be able to see how exciting science can be firsthand and hear stories about careers in scientific fields. They will learn that these options are within their grasps. This knowledge will improve their high school education as they are motivated into higher math and science courses and influence their college and career decisions. They will realize that they can have a career that is both fulfilling and important, helping them to attain their portion of the American Dream.

The teacher will also monitor that the art activity is student centered and that proper communication is displayed. For critical thinking, students will evaluate their finished work using a teacher-made rubric. They will identify neatness, excellent craftsmanship, proportion of facial features and creativity of work. Students enjoy making portraits and it's important for self esteem and the whole child. I want to have the best materials to continue to provide a quality art program. This art activity will make students feel good about themselves.

The kids will vie to be the first one to find out what happens, and I know they will come and share each exciting event in the books with me. Some of the titles will be used in small groups-the Elephant and Piggie books are a ton of fun to use to teach expression when reading. A few of the books, like The Book With No Pictures, will be used as read alouds to model good reading and thinking during reading. Donations to this project will open up new books to my kiddos which will in turn open up new worlds for them.

I have a small room that serves as an office and treatment space for children with communication deficits. My approach is to directly teach children the communication skill they need and then allow for practice and carryover through play with peers. My school has a wide variety of programs ranging from severely disabled students in both primary and secondary life skills classrooms, to the district level gifted program, in addition to a K-5 regular education elementary program. My caseload includes students with autism, selective mutism, intellectual disability, language disorders, and developmental delays. My project is specifically designed for those students with autism and selective mutism. I work with them directly on social communication skills which is very stressful and difficult for them. Many of them dislike school due to the anxiety caused by having to communicate with peers and adults. I have had success with having them come into the speech room with a buddy or two and complete puzzles, play board games or build with Lego's. My supply, however, is quite low and I am in need of a bigger variety of high interest puzzle and building toys to keep their engagement and enthusiasm up as well as their peers. With the addition of the puzzles and magnetic toys I've requested, my students will have more choices of what they can do with their speech buddies. The few items that I have used to date have allowed one of my students with significant anxiety related to autism and selective mutism to begin to build friendships with two other boys in his class. He is able to practice looking at others when he speaks, asking questions, initiating conversation, and being flexible when interacting with others. His mother reports that he no longer fights coming to school because he has something to look forward to every day before lunch. This project will allow my students to practice their communication skills, make friends and have fun while working on speech, social communication, problem solving, and language skills.

When they see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know what the next art project will be. We are a Title I school, so most of my students receive free breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to help students in need. We have academic clubs, after school tutoring, Saturday school, and daily academic pull-out programs. These additional programs have helped our students, and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. I plan on having my students view, research, and discuss various athletes and sports in flexible groups. They will discuss the need for daily exercise and the need for consuming healthy food choices. We will discuss and have a better understanding of the food pyramid. I have requested paper, markers, and mat frames. For the culminating activity, my students will draw themselves doing their favorite sport using the paper and markers requested. Some examples are: a gymnast, ballet dancer, ice skater, basketball player, baseball player, and swimmer. The finished pictures will be displayed throughout the school in the special mat frames requested. The pictures will serve as a visual reminder to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. Students will be challenged to make better food choices and increase physical activity. Since I teach in a Title I school, I am limited in resources and materials. I work with over 840 students, so materials are consumed quickly. Students will participate in groups researching, discussing and illustrating their favorite sports.

I am always looking for ways to make learning fun, exciting and engaging for all students. We are currently using white boards, dry erase markers and erasers to have students explain their thinking when solving math problems. The Boogie Board eWriters will allow us to accomplish the same goal without the waste and cost of the markers. The Boogie Boards are extremely motivating and will help those students who are less engaged. It encourages a more hands-on approach to learning. It will also facilitate my teaching because I will spend less time on distributing materials and more time teaching content. Your donation can help improve my instruction. The Boogie Boards will encourage students to show their thinking in a variety of ways. They are much more student friendly than paper and pencil or even white boards.

We struggle with many of the same issues all urban school struggle with: full classrooms, tired teachers, not enough supplies, frustration at the lack of support, gang related violence, the many faces of poverty... But that is not what defines my students!!! My students are bright young individuals who deserve access a thriving educational environment which is full of rich literature. I am building a new course which will focus on race and ethnicity and their meanings. We will explore their role in shaping our identities. The texts will be used to examine racial and ethnic inequalities in the United States, the nature of racism, discrimination, and stereotyping. My students will use these texts as an inspiration to explore their own race. They will first be able to read about others' experiences through their biographies, poetry, short stories and first-hand accounts. We will then have class discussions and write our own reflections about our own experiences both as they relate to the text and as they relate to our own roles in society. Text such as 'Letters to a Young Brother' can be used as open and honest inspiration as well as a starting point for discussions such as: why are these letters written? who they are written to? what do they hope to acheive? We will discuss authors' historical background and intended audiences for each work we explore. These text will bring exciting textures and and voices to our class.

My class consists of students, with significant developmental delays. Each day they face challenges with learning, language, and socialization; however, they always seem to have positive attitudes and the brightest smiles. My students are known throughout my school, and are a welcome part of any regular education classroom, or extracurricular activity. Just as we all need food, throughout the course of the day, students with disabilities, have a need for sensory input, that must be met. These needs are met through a personalized plan called a sensory diet. A sensory diet is a carefully designed, personalized activity plan, that provides the sensory input a person needs to stay focused and organized, throughout the day. Having a sensory table, within my classroom, with various sensory items like Sensory Sand, Speedy Snow, and buckets, will be a great way to integrate the sensory input needs of my students, into everyday lessons and activities. Providing a sensory table within my classroom, will better allow me to best meet the sensory input needs of each of my students, while incorporating individual students' learning goals and objectives. Students will be able to access various sensory items within the classroom on a daily basis, instead of having to leave to go to the sensory room, when our schedule allows.

These are a few of the words I could use to describe the students who come through the doors of my classroom each day. I have taught for 12 years in two urban school districts. I spent my first three years at a high school in Lawrence, MA teaching freshman English, and the past 9 years have been at another high school. I have a passion for urban education, and I participated in a cohort for urban scholars at Boston College where I earned my Masters in Secondary English Education. While teaching, I learned more than I have ever taught. My students are profoundly influential on my life, and I am so privileged to be able to teach these amazing individuals. I coached both novice and varsity crew for 6 years during the early part of my teaching career, before I had children. Currently, I run the outdoor adventure club which has about 85 students. This year we have gone hiking, snow shoeing, orienteering, and skiing. Teaching is my profession, but my students are my motivation and inspiration. I would like to take the course 'Writing for Children' so that I can explore the world in its' many plots. Stories for children, like stories for adults, come in many colors, from dark to light, and the best have in common archetypal characters, resonant plots, and concise, poetic language. The course I will take will use new and classic texts as inspiration, and we will try our hands writing in a variety of forms. This chance to write children's stories will serve as an inspiration and freeing spring board for me to explore writing in genres which will be used in my own classroom for creative writing and so much more for my own students. My students are yearning to move beyond the stifling essay and into the fanciful, and I am desirous to learn of ways to make this happen. I hope this course will give me a grounding to make this discourse possible. Children's literature and writing for children is only the beginning of freeing the imagination for myself and my student's writing.

My students are 2nd graders that have been accepted into the Gifted and Talented academy for our district. Being young and identified as gifted they should be challenged in academics and technology. Most of my students do not have computers at home, which means students need to learn about technology and resources in the classroom. Students learn how to work collaboratively with each other through online resources, but are also provided some opportunities to have fun on the computers. Children now a days, as well as adults, seem to be less active looking for a lazy way to do something. A lot of what needs to be done at school is sitting down and not being active and I want to change how students are working and learning in their classrooms. Students need to get up and move and engage their bodies and brain, so I would like to implement a challenge to my 2nd grade students of appropriate steps every day, then use that data to track students and create fun math activities for their teachers with. As a technology teacher I can only teach so much basics, I rather teach them with data and activities they can interact with. Having students wear different types of pedometers and tracking using Google Sheets and write about it on Google Docs I can show more about the programs with their own data and experiences. Showing them how to use a program will not make them learn it, but having them do an activity about themselves in the program will help them learn and remember it. Having students wear pedometers will help them want to be more active and learn the appropriate ways to move and learn in class. They will be able to track their own data and learn programs they are going to need for the rest of their education by doing little projects based on their own data.

My students need more hands-on experiences, particularly with measurement in math and science. My students are curious and engaged learners who love learning with hands-on activities and games. Our school is in a high-poverty area and students often come with deficits in background knowledge, literacy, and real-world experiences. Our students love to come to school every day and take pride in their school and their learning. The most memorable and valuable lessons for them are ones that use real-world activities to connect to their real-life experiences. For example, having measuring cups will help students understand the concept of whole, half, and quarter when we follow recipes in math as a way to cement the concept of fractions. My students struggle to connect math and science to their daily lives--and across the curriculum. I had a student this year ask me why we were doing math during our science block! Measurement is an easy way to make those connections, yet students come to me with a poor understanding of concepts such as fractions, length, weight, and volume. Materials like a balance, scale, measuring cups, and thermometers will help us in our daily math classes and in our physical science units. We learn about weather and heat transfer, so the thermometers will aid in experiments measuring temperature. The scale will give students opportunities to measure the mass of substances before and after an interaction, and better understand the Law of Conservation of Matter. I will use the balance to help students understand the concept of balancing an algebraic equation so they can actually see and feel when you change the quantity on one side, you must adjust the other side to keep the equation balanced. For better or worse, standardized tests are a big part of public education. I know that having these measurement materials will help students dig deeper into math and science content, giving them a more firm understanding and helping them be more successful on tour End-of-Grade tests.

My students now love reading and cannot wait to learn what we will be reading next year. These books will help me to continue to improve and get them ready. These are hands down the best students that I have worked with. They may have a rough exterior, but deep down they are super sweet and willing to learn. Over the course of the year, roughly 60% of my students made growth in reading according to our state assessments, and many of those who may not have shown growth were already reading above their grade level. They work hard every day to improve, and I have seen those changes not only in scores but also in their mindsets. They started out as a group that often disliked reading and would complain about it, but now they are constantly coming to my class, usually while I am teaching, in hopes of borrowing a new book or getting their novel so that they can read ahead. I want to continue that trend in my kids, and this project will go a long way to improve that. Some of these books will help the students directly, while some of them will help me to improve my teaching and thus impact them indirectly. The book that has the graphic organizers is something that will be reproduced for them. The bell-ringing book offers activities to help improve their reading and bring them some excitement. Some of the other books will help to improve their skills in non-fiction texts and informational texts, which is a key 21st Century Skill. My project will make a difference because it will improve the quality of my instruction, and by extension, allow me to better teaching reading. I already have won over the hearts and minds of my students and managed to change their views on reading. My next step is to build upon that by finding new and creative ways to help teach them the reading strategies that they will need to be successful.

Through collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving is what they need to have to thrive in today's society. My biggest challenge in getting my students there is our lack of technology. My students represent 5 different counties in the Western Carolinas. Some families have chosen to commute long distances to be able to attend our school. I know a family that travels almost an hour very morning to drop there child off by 7:30am. They are excited and vivacious and eager to learn! But most importantly, they believe in our school. My school is a new school that opened August of 2014. It is a year round, collegiate prep school that believes in educating the whole child without the demands and anxieties of too much testing. The teachers are creative, energetic and has taught on very little resources, furniture or curriculum. Yet they are happy because they are also vivacious and eager to teach! Our school has built a community where everyone loves to be there and learning is rigorous. Through the use of the 8 Apple iPads and iPad protectors, my students will be learning Literacy Skills through technology. The Apple iPads will primarily be used inside my classroom through Kindergarten Literacy Center time where I will enforce their literacy skills through apps that enrich alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, reading and reading comprehension. With a splitter, each iPad will be used with 2 students at a time collaborating together to enhance these skills. The Apple iPads and iPad protectors will also be used for class intervention groups for at risk students in Language Arts and Math inside my classroom. The students will practice grade levels standards that are connected to the common core that they have particularly been struggling with. With this extra piece of intervention I will be able to guide our students to become more confident and successful in their educational career. '21st-century skills' is generally used to refer to certain core competencies such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving that advocates believe schools need to teach to help students thrive in today's world. Without the proper resources, a student will not have the 21st century skills needed to be a 21st century learner. Your donation will change this.

They make connections between Literature and Nonfiction, and what is happening today, in the real world. We debate, discuss, and infer together, and everyone is encouraged to 'show what they know'! Our school is unique because we are a public school but gifted, regular, and disabled students all attend classes together and there are lots of opportunities for cross grade interactions. It is normal to see students of all ability levels playing basketball with two students in wheelchairs, or a 4th grader teaching a 1st grader to sound out words, or how to design a catapult! Some 4th grade students visit 5th grade once a week because we do what is best for kids. We are an IMPACT Academy, that stresses Problem Solving and Positive attitudes, and as the front of our school announces, 'All students are welcome at Garden Grove!'. This year we will have 35 students in each of two fourth grade classrooms. We want to extend our Literature Circle book sets to include a Science Fiction genre (When you Reach Me), a realistic fiction (Because of Winn Dixie) and a Historical Fiction (By the Great Horn Spoon). Since we only receive about $100/year for books & supplies, these extra book sets, and art supplies of paint, pencils, paper and pastels are critical for our extension projects to provide readers additional ways to revisit what they've read, and continue the conversations and discoveries to create even more meaning. Game Boards, CD Covers, Character bookmarks, collages, ABC books, commemorative stamps, accordion books, paper story quilts and salt dough maps are some of the planned projects. Extra kids mean extra books and supplies needed! No one should be left without a book or art supplies! As more and more students are packed into our classrooms, we sometimes forget the power of one book-one student. While it is true students could share novels, there is something magical about curling up on the rug with your own book, reading at your own pace, and getting lost in that literary world for a while each day. These few extra sets of books mean one book/child . The art supplies mean there are enough supplies even for students who come from homes who cannot afford extras.

With the limited supply of books that we have in our school, it is very difficult to keep the interest in reading for my students. As a teacher, I make the most of what I have for them. Using the sight reader books will help my students to identify the common sight words in the English language. Once they can identify those words, their vocabulary and reading skills will become stronger. The letter blocks will help the lower level students who have not yet mastered identifying letters and words. The blocks will give them a hands on approach to spelling and building words. The pennies will be an excellent way to introduce the concept of 1s and 10s to the students. These donations will greatly improve the learning environment for my students. My lower level students will be able to learn the alphabet and construct beginning words and have fun doing it.

We are requesting a mini iPad. I tried to use my personal Kindle Fire in the classroom. Unfortunately, it does not allow Java or Adobe. Therefore, it limits the educational sites that the students can use. The iPad does allow both Java and Adobe and therefore the educational websites will not be blocked or limited.

So I want to offer every way possible the chance for a student to fully understand what they are reading, whether it's listening to me or holding a book in their hands, or listening to a CD. Last year we did a unit on fairy tales and the students loved it. However, there were not enough books to go around and we did not have the CD's to listen to. I know that would have made such an impact on my students if they were given the chance to hear the stories while they were reading them.

This fact absolutely amazes them. It opens their minds to other people and places. We will be doing family trees this year. My students will learn about the make-up of families by reading these books. They will be able to understand how families are structured. I found that when students actually write the dates on a daily basis and the months and days they remember them more and quicker than if they just see the calendar on the board.

They've never truly found a book they are inspired by, or a book that offers a strong role model that makes them want to know more about themselves and the world around them. I want change! My traditional English students are in 8th grade and have tried to find many creative ways around not doing real work so that they can 'slide by' and not be noticed. They 'fake read' because they don't know who they are as readers and they no longer care about stories or the heroes that lay within the pages of a novel. I have a large percentage of energetic students curious about history. I have students with low reading scores who would never consider 'reading' on their top 100 hobbies of 'after school activities'. My school's largest demographic category is low social economic status. I believe every child can learn, but that they need the right tools. I believe that the adapted young adult book 'Unbroken' can be the very book that changes their reluctance into sizzling energy. Olympian Louis Zamperini spends a difficult 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. 'Unbroken' is the story about resilience of the human mind, body and spirit, and can give inspiration to students and teach them the value of perseverance. Students will engage in literature circles and will discuss the major events in small group settings. Students will not only write objective academic summaries, but will, but will cite evidence that proves Zamperini is a hero. Students will also draw inferences about the main character to support their opinion and establish a formal writing style by doing so. Overall, the book will inspire struggling readers to read more, and to write more compelling essays that challenge them to cite evidence and to use logical reasoning in their essays. If I can get one student to love this book, I may have perhaps caused them to become life long readers. If I can do that, I have created a critical thinker. I've helped create one more soul dedicated to becoming a stronger citizen all by having read a book about a tough American hero who refused to give up. I can get my class talking about historical issues, and real people who turned crisis into an opportunity to prevail. I believe 'Unbroken' is that one book.

Many of my students come from a Spanish speaking home environment. As a bilingual teacher it is my responsibility to continue building a base for their Spanish while simultaneously supporting them in their English learning journey. For many of these students, this is their first learning experience in the US, making it even more important that they have an outstanding experience that will form a base from which they can launch themselves forward into environments of higher learning. At the moment my students are using flipped cubbies as their book shelving and storage. It's not always convenient for the students since they cannot reach some of the books and materials. It's also not convenient for me since the cubbies tend to be taller than proper children's shelving which can obscure my view of the children while they are engaged in their learning centers.

Middle school is full of exciting challenges every day-from finding just the right book for an eighth grade boy who would rather eat a book than read it to collaborating with teachers in instructing teachers about information literacy. We are staffed with excellent teachers who are excited to try new approaches in order to engage students. The Makery, as our Makerspace is called, is an environment where students can explore concepts and ideas that are within and without the standard curriculum. With no grades assigned, students can explore freely on their own, or engage in enriching activities created by teachers. Through the use of Arduino, Makey Makey, and Snap Circuits, students will learn about programming and electronics. Through the use of Legos and K'Nex, students will investigate building. Through the use of a 3D printer, students will be able to take design and visualization to another level. Libraries (and librarians) are constantly evolving and adapting to meet the needs of its students and teachers. With shop and home economic classes disappearing from the education landscape, the Makerspaces are filling the void for many students.

We struggle with many of the same issues all urban school struggle with: full classrooms, not enough supplies, the many faces of poverty... But that is not what defines my students!!! My students are bright young individuals who deserve access a thriving educational environment which moves them beyond the traditional classroom walls. Students will use the backpacks and water bottles to go on day hikes with the outdoor adventure club at the high school. The outdoor adventure club is a space in which students can get outside of the four walls of the school environment and explore the natural environment. We will focus on our own impact on the environment. Students will examine questions such as: What is conservation? What are ways in which we can conserve our resources in our daily activities?How does conservation help to save and restore the environment? Why is conservation important for future generations? Students learn about and will be able to teach other club members about “leave no trace” WE will become SMARTER, TOGETHER. I would like to take students on an overnight excursion in which we are able to explore the outdoors in a more immersive way. During this overnight trip, we will journal and write about our experiences. Students will use their head lamps, and be encouraged to share their writing.

I want them to take pride in every piece of work they do. Also, students would benefit from testing partitions. The partitions would provide a focused and private environment for students during writing and assessments. A factor that contributes to students doing their best is creating the right environment. More than anything, I want my students to develop a life long passion for learning. I have often heard as an educator that success breeds success. What better way to reiterate this than to help each child feel important.

My 6th grade students come from a culturally diverse, large urban area. Some students travel up to an hour just to get to school. I teach science in a regular classroom that has been converted into a science lab. My students are eager learners who want to spark their inner scientist, but can't always do so. We need access to a large lab table for setting up equipment. It is also difficult to use equipment that requires washing or investigate dirty, fun activities because we can't wash our hands. My hope is for students to be exposed to fun, challenging investigations using proper science materials and equipment. We don't have access to water in the classroom. With a mobile lab table and portable sink, my students will be able to perform messy and engaging experiments, wash hands and clean equipment in a safe manner without leaving the classroom. Science students should learn the importance of safe lab behaviors such as cleaning hands and equipment. Students otherwise need to leave the room to wash which interferes with the investigation and supervision.

Our students are here at INVEST Collegiate in order to take part in a whole child educational experience. Instead of focusing solely on test scores, our mission is to raise the bar for every student by exposing all ability levels to higher level thinking skills and tap into their individual strengths and interests. We reject the one-size-fits-all educational construct and focus on social, emotional and physical well being as well as academics. Having iPads in the classroom will allow us to create centers where students can take turns 'playing' on educational applications at their own personal ability levels. They will also have access to a variety of books beyond our limited classroom budgets. Teachers can also set up specific WebQuests with a list of URLs so that students can research specific topics on their own without being exposed to search engines. Having Internet access simply allows students to go beyond the classroom walls and be exposed to unlimited free resources available to teachers and students.

Being able to love reading can open a person's mind to things they never knew and I believe that every student deserve the opportunity to have that experience. Our school is very diverse, therefore we have many students that come from different backgrounds. We have a lot of military families, low poverty and high poverty, single parent families or no parent families, homeless families, and a big population of Malti-cultural families. Because of this our school is extremely community and family oriented. We want to do everything we can to make sure every student is being included and feels safe and able to learn. One thing I have noticed is either students love to read because they have access to do so, or students hate to read because of their inability to do so. This inability can come from a lack of access to reading materials outside of the classroom. I want students to be able to use the kindles as another way to read books they love. I also would like to use the camera's on the Kindles for projects or QR Code's during in class assignments. I believe that it is important to have technology available at the students fingertips because that is where this generation is headed. My hope is for students to be able to access reading in a different and meaningful way with these Kindles. They will allow students with sight impairments and English Language Learners to read with a font that is best for their needs. Also, English Language Learners will have access to texts in their language and at their level.

Nowhere is this more apparent than when young children are absorbed in a game that is actually teaching them the basics of computer coding. My students are bright and eager third graders that reflect the rich diversity of our community. We are a wonderful mix of racial backgrounds, home languages, and ethnic backgrounds. Approximately forty percent of our students receive free or reduced lunches. Although some of my students have access to computers at home, many do not. They are all eager but, even at third grade, it is easy to see the beginning of a developing digital divide. This iPad and keyboard will make it possible to set up a coding station in my classroom. The kids will be able to use applications that disguise the logic and skills of coding as familiar games. These games are highly motivating and teach students the basics of computer programming while fostering perseverance and problem solving. Since the interface with the iPad is so intuitive, students with very little computer experience will still be able to access the applications and develop coding and basic computing skills. Having an iPad with a keyboard to use as coding station in class will give all students equal opportunity to explore the critical beginning skills of computer programming. It will also help give all of my students familiarity and confidence with computing. Although we are a small school, we strive to provide enrichment and those special experiences that make students want to come to school and learn. This coding station is a high interest, highly educational activity that will make students eager to persevere and learn skills that will serve them well into adulthood. It will also begin to bridge the digital divide that is already beginning to develop.

Last year, my 5th graders used Chromebooks across all disciplines, but we had to share a tech cart with multiple classrooms. I want to expand my students' ability to do this kind of work this year but we need more Chromebooks. Our school is a microcosm of our community; our diversity spans culture, heritage, and socioeconomic status. Half of my students qualify for free and reduced lunch, which means their families are living below the poverty line. Our district continues to invest in technology opportunities and now all students have Google accounts and we use Google docs to share our work. We have recently upgraded our broadband, and teachers an take technology-focused professional development. However, we still do not have enough computers in the classroom. Currently, shared Chromebook carts are stored in the library and have to be checked out by teachers and moved from class to class. This is not only a waste of time, it is also disruptive to the teachers and students. We want to improve the technology experience for our students in the most efficient way possible, and having enough Chromebooks is a simple, cost-effective solution. My students will use these Chromebooks for learning across many disciplines. Last year, using the shared Chromebook carts from the library, we did research, wrote poetry, created Google slide show book reports, and used Khan Academy and Arcademics to provide individualized math instruction. With more Chromebooks, we can reach more individual students and increase the amount of learning happening in our classroom. This DonorsChoose grant is part of our school's overall strategy to utilize a variety of funding sources to achieve our goal of a Chromebook on every student’s desk. We will use the Chromebooks to do research, create reports and projects, and work on individualized math activities. My students will also learn basic skills such as typing and navigating the internet, especially since several of my students do not have access to this at home. This project will make a difference in the following ways: Individualized Instruction: my students will have the opportunity to receive individual math problems to solve, e-books to read, and websites/topics to research using technology.

Math needs to be hands-on and active. Children need to work together to solve problems and persevere. Gifted math students need to be pushed and challenged. Our school is in Clark County, Ohio. We are classified as a 'rural fringe' school. We serve about 950 students in our Elementary, grades pre K-6. 42% of our elementary students are low income and we are a Title one school. My students have been identified as gifted in Mathematics. They come to me every day for their math instruction. They are so much fun. They love to learn and still get excited about new activities. I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I would love to have Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They would also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. Students could build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class will inspire teamwork, encourage perseverance, and promote a positive attitude towards solving math problems. Learning to persevere through problem situations is invaluable to my students. For most of them, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated.

Creating a multi-genre classroom library with popular books is what I'm hoping will be the key to unlocking a life-long love of reading for my students. I have the best students in the whole world! OK, well I am admittedly biased. While they are not the highest socio-economic level, they are hard working and goal oriented. Most of my middle school students want to go to college and work toward that goal. Many of the parents have a college background, and those that don't work hard to keep their families comfortable. Unfortunately, we don't have a great local library and parents don't always have the opportunity to take their kids to the library to get the books that they want. Our school places literacy development very high in our academics and we want our students to improve their reading levels each year. We have a designated 30 minute period 4 times a week where students are expected to read to work toward this goal. Our district has had a multitude of budgetary woes in recent years and one area that has been hit hard is in our libraries. We just don't have the number of current books available to meet the students wants. I can't wait to stand at my bookshelf with a student and have a conversation with them about books! Often times a student will not know what to read and I have to fly somewhat blindly when suggesting books that they may enjoy. With a well stocked library we can actually look at, pick up, and peruse through potential books to read. Students participate in book talks weekly, which helps others to add to their queue of next books to read. If I have many of these books available to the students it would help to increase the number of books that they read. Furthermore, we are going to be having Literacy Circle units this year where students will read multiple books from a specific genre. This allows student to have thoughtful talks and discussions on specific genre traits, theme and plot development, as well as how characters and setting work to move the plot and theme along. Kids need to have books available to them if we are going to ask them to read. The flip chart easel and Post-It notes will also help. Not all kids are readers. Often kids 'hate' reading because they haven't found the right book(s) for them. If students have a variety of genres, subject, and lengths of books I am confident that this can help to tear down the 'I hate reading' wall. I've seen students blossom when they have a chance to talk to their peers about books.

The students will need the earbuds to listen to the videos to reinforce concepts taught or listen to new concepts introduced. They will also use them to practice their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts. This will provide them with the automaticity they need for more challenging math concepts . The styluses will be used for assignments in Popplet, Book Creator and in Google Classroom.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life.

My students are bright young individuals who deserve access to a thriving educational environment which challenges them to examine their own identity and how they can relate to others in this diverse world. My students will use the paint to examine their own skin colors in relation to those around them. We will mix the paint and paint our own skin in order to spark conversation about color and language around race. We need tape and glue to create our projects which include dissecting advertisements, building presentations around tolerance, and other hands-on alternative assessments. Students will enter class with their senses stimulated with relaxing lavender. This is a proven method of relaxation and tension releasing. Students will be encouraged to read and have small conversations in my 'library' area of the classroom. This area is already rich in books, but we want to build a room within a room with a sofa. I will use the requested books to help inform my lesson planning, and pull out excerpts to share with students. The donation of these materials, will help add to the enrichment and feel of our classroom. Every day will be a full sensory experience in our class as we delve into the complex world of Race and literature. My students will enter a class which is transformed beyond the standard classroom. They will be comforted and secure to begin the difficult work of learning and growing.

I find a silly video that relates to the topic we will cover. This activates their prior knowledge and gets them on track for the newest skill. I have a typical seventh grade class. My students are from a variety of socioeconomic and racial backgrounds. Many of my students' parents are in the military. The skill level varies from extremely high to extremely low. Most are highly motivated learners and are very interested in science. My students need 28 subscriptions to Science World magazine and 4 periodic tables. I would like to use science magazines to increase student interest in real world science. The magazines will provide insight into how science is applied in today's world. They will also provide access to more nonfiction text and help transition students into the new text-rich curriculum. Using magazines in science class will allow the students to see the relevance of the subject matter. Science World has high interest articles on current events. This will allow real world application of subject matter. Reading nonfiction will increase reading proficiency. I have also requested periodic tables. The seventh grade is when students begin using a this table.

Students often cannot checkout books on their level that interest them because we don't have enough books to accommodate their needs. My students will be reading these books and analyzing them for plot structure, character development, inferring meaning, point of view, and bias. Students will have a book checkout time in my classroom library so they can read the books and have quick access to many choices.

These are just a few words that describe the Academically Talented students I get to work with each day. These students are excited about learning and would love to have the opportunity to take their learning to the next level with a 3D printer. The seed of a 3D printer and a makerspace was planted by last year's Academically Talented teacher. Now, the 8th grade class, in their last year at the middle school, would like to make a 3D printer a reality in the 5th through 8th grade Academically Talented program. Eager to learn, discover, and create, the students are also excited to be able to design, code, print, and ultimately hold their own ideas in their hands. Before even receiving a 3D printer and just by creating this project, the students are learning about planning and marketing. The students began with researching 3D printers in order to determine the best printer to meet their needs. As they develop this project together, they are also working as a team to market and spread the word about this campaign so that it is successful. Once the students have received this 3D printer and filament, so many more opportunities will be open to them. From learning to code and design their own projects and inventions, to the problem-solving, and persistence required to refine their projects, the students will be able to develop the hands-on learning experiences needed to increase their STEM awareness and 21st Century Skills that are so necessary to their future. Our goal is to make our ideas and projects come to life with a 3D printer. The addition of a 3D printer to the Academically Talented program will allow us to actually apply our learning in real ways, rather than just through discussion or writing. This 3D printer is not only for us, but for all of the current and future students in the program. We are leading this project not only for ourselves, but for the younger AT students as well. We are not only researching and typing up this campaign, but we are planning a media campaign within our school and community to create awareness for our project. This project is important to our school and community because it will provide us and the younger Academically Talented students with a multitude of opportunities that were not available before. We will be able to learn about coding and project design as we become the engineers. And while we, the 8th grade class, will be gone in a year, what we have done for the AT program will not.

Elaina wants to be a nurse, Stevie, a cosmetologist, and Josiah want to work in the automotive industry. They are currently taking human anatomy class or chemistry class. The students are interested in having a 3-D printer in the classroom because they believe it will help them understand science concepts better. They are visual learners who need to see and touch items to help them better comprehend material. They like the idea of a 3-D printer because they will be able to design models, such as bones or molecules, and then be able to print it. This project will help the students build skills necessary for their careers. One academic skill they will develop is the ability to analyze scientific models. Standardized testing often uses models and the students must answer questions about them. If students can design and analyze their own models, it will help them understand other kinds of models. In addition, students will work together to use the printer. They will have to develop communication skills to help each other design a model. They will also have to communicate to others when they explain models. We want to get a 3-D printer to help us with science class. We would be able to see what we're learning about in 3-D. The 3-D printer will help us to develop our study habits and improve our test grades because we can take the models to our dorm to help us study. We would be leaders by showing our models in science fairs so we can teach others about science. We could teach the other students and staff how to use the printer. Other people might see our models and be interested in buying a 3-D printer for their classroom and students. The printer will help us to become motivated. We could see and touch the models and we wouldn't have to only look at pictures. If we have the 3-D printer, other students would be fascinated to join the science classes. We, as deaf students, are more visual learners so it would benefit us to use the models from a 3-D printer because we'd be able to interact and be able to touch it and see it in more depth.

They are two of the Outdoor Adventure Club class officers, and they want to make this year's trips 'the best ever!' I was amazed at the way in which they developed the project. All the officers of the Outdoor Adventure Club stayed late after one meeting and brainstormed all the trips they would love to take, but we simply can not afford. Once someone hit on the idea of going on a zip line, everyone was talking at once. I told the students about Ramblewild - an outdoor ropes and course with obstacles that meander from tree to tree at various heights through the forest. Two students took the lead. I gave them the questions from DonorsChoose, and they worked collaboratively over google Docs. to create the project. Ramblewild will give students the three hours helping each other climb through the trees to strengthen their bond and their belief in their own abilities. It is an awesome way to teach teamwork – all while challenging their limits in the outdoors! Students cannot maneuver from one obstacle course to the next by themselves. They must rely on each other to map out routes, plan each method of traversing the course, and stick together. This will require empathy for one another and group problem-solving as the courses can be quite difficult. Students will learn about sustainability. The 10-acre adventure park is owned by Feronia Forests, a corporation which encourages landowners to develop sustainable income opportunities, rather than using their land to harvest lumber. Ramblewild is an Eco-friendly adventure park high in the trees of a hemlock forest. All of the elements of the park are attached to the trees using tension, rather than bolts or screws, so the trees remain unscathed. Project Help Us Get To Ramblewild is about attracting teenagers who are not invested with nature and introducing them to it in an exciting and heart-pulsing way. Ramblewild is the trip that is the medium between being completely away from society and being a city kid. By writing this grant, we are taking a step forward as leaders by partly funding the adventure and becoming more beneficial members to the club. With the help of our fellow officers, we will facilitate a means to getting the job done efficiently and elegantly. News of this trip has already peaked the interest of many teens. The club does not sell itself to everyone. For most teens, any time away from modern luxuries is like a detention. We want to show teens the joy of nature and the connection we once had with it. We want to share the feeling of accomplishment from scaling mountains and many other things while doing it all together!

I feel that an iPad not only allows the students the opportunity to become familiar with the test and how it works, but also it is a fun and easy way to learn math with the many apps that are available. In order for students to be successful in the work force, they need to be able to think analytically, have a creative and innovative mind, USE TECHNOLOGY, and have the curiosity and imagination to take them further. These skills can all start by using an iPad to manipulate problems and how the outcome changes just by touching the screen.

Our school is comprised of students from a variety of economic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds and education needs. My wonderful 4th grade students are full of energy and curiosity. They love to learn together and work hard to go above and beyond in their learning, Many of our students struggle to remain focused and actively involved in their education. Our students sit on hard chairs at individual desks and are constantly moving our classroom furniture to create collaborative learning spaces. They are active learners that are ready to work together, and the Hokki Stools will be a great addition to our classroom! Our students will utilize the Hokki Stools at our newly developed collaborative table space. As we re-imagine our learning space, we will create an additional table and stool environment that invites students to work together and collaborate throughout the day. These stools also allow for easy movement and on the spot collaboration. This might occur during a group writing conference, a student led book club, a science investigation, or a group math task. The Hokki Stools provide many of our students an opportunity to wiggle and work. These ergonomic stools allow for a quiet way to move and will stimulate students physically as well as mentally! Many of our students have a difficult time focusing for long periods of time. The Hokki Stools that we currently have in our classroom have made a tremendous difference for students.

But they can only show you if the technology works. Unfortunately in our school, our computers are not always working. It's really hit or miss as to whether they are going to work on a given day. So when the technology is down, my students miss out on the educational websites that I have assigned them to do. I would love for them to have the opportunity to be able to hold a little piece of the world right in their own hands. I want them to use technology every day because when they reach adulthood, they will use it in some shape or form on their jobs. I am requesting a mini iPad. I tried to use my personal Kindle Fire in the classroom. Unfortunately, it does not allow Java or Adobe. Therefore, it limits the educational sites that my students can use. The iPad mini does allow both Java and Adobe and therefore the educational websites will not be blocked or limited. My students will be able to use this to go on educational sites, such as BrainPop Jr. and Starfall. Those sites are excellent for beginning readers, which is what my students are. I have them registered for Learning A-Z, which is a great site for reading, as well. I want them to be comfortable using modern technology because that is what is expected for their generation. The iPad mini will give more students a chance to be on the 'computer' on a daily basis. It will give them access to activities online that coincide with our lessons, such as learning about animal habitats, or learning about the digestive system. My students try to go on ScootPad every day which assesses their English & math skills. They will be able to do so on the iPad mini even if the computers are not working.

They come from broken families, or parents who work multiple jobs just to pay rent. It is hard for them to continue their learning at home because parents are working hard to make ends meet, or they simply don't have any materials to work with. Due to this fact, many of them are below grade level, and struggling to get caught up. To help my students, we work in small groups on a regular basis. We gather around our table for reading, math, and writing just to name a few! Unfortunately, sometimes the small group is eight students, and we have to sit at a table made for six (if even)! Students don't have space to put all of their materials, much less enough space to put their arms on the table and write comfortably. With this new table, there will be enough space to seat eight students. Plus, the table is scalloped, so each student has their own area.

My classes will then transfer what they've learned about the children's books to write their own book. This is the third year that I've done this activity and it's been the single most completed assignment that I do. My students develop their own characters and story line. They create a story for an elementary student that they would like to tell. My students write and illustrate their own children's books. They become authors! Once the books are completed, my students visit the local elementary school and partner with a younger student to share their book. The books are then given to the younger students for their classroom library.

This project will give my students the confidence to believe that they can do something to help others. This will be another step towards their goal to be successful in 7th grade this year.

My students have been identified as gifted in Mathematics. They come to me every day for their math instruction. They are so much fun. They love to learn and still get excited about new activities. I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I love having Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. With the addition of the cubelets students will build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class inspires teamwork, encourages perseverance, and promotes a positive attitude towards solving math problems. For most of my students, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated. I want them to experience the true self-esteem that comes from sticking with hard problems.

Over the years I have watched the kindergarten curriculum increase in its educational requirements as the common core standards for students leaving kindergarten have soared to very high heights for our youngest learners.

Our youngest learners are eager to learn, I simply want to design a positive learning environment that will help make their educational journey enjoyable. Adding round spacious and comfortable tables to the classroom will allow the students to work both independently and collaboratively. Students will have their own space to keep their materials better organized which will help make their learning endeavors more productive and successful. In addition, the round collaborative feel of the tables will also allow many opportunities for the students during group activities to communicate with each other and create collaborative projects.

My students are zesty, passionate, hilarious, and aspiring literary critics. They are authors, scientists, and social revolutionaries. They are scholars. More than 75% of my students began the year reading 2 or more years below grade level. Make no mistake. Being behind does not mean that you aren't brilliant. Some of the brightest students I have ever taught have started significantly behind, caught up, and surpassed grade level norms all within a single year. With your help, we can all reach our goal of growing our reading by 2 grade levels and scoring in the 75th percentile on nationally normed tests. This year, my students and I are annihilating low expectations by setting the bar that EVERY student grows at least 2 grade levels and reads more than 10 novels. In order to achieve this, students will be supplementing our class time together with 30 minutes of reading each night. Students get to pick the books that they can best connect with. With more copies of best young adult fiction, we are sure to reach infinitely more students and inspire years of reading to come! Some of my ELL (English Language Learners) will make good use of the grammar workbook as their English and writing improves throughout the year! Please make a difference for my students!

When I found the Dictionary of Prefixes and Suffixes, I knew I had to try my best to get this resource in my classroom for my students. All of my students will benefit from strengthening their skills and learning word parts so they can increase their vocabulary and become better readers. If they learn the roots, suffixes, and prefixes, they can determine the meaning of unknown words and do better as they read complex text, especially while they are testing.

They are so proud of what they have accomplished and I am so proud of them too. It is their goal to get their intricate piece of fiber art on the Wall of Fame. My K-5 school is a great place to be. I am surrounded by resilience and creativity everyday. My students inspire me. I am the only counselor in a K-5 school so I keep VERY busy. My students are very motivated but many struggle with getting basic needs met at home. 100 percent of them get free lunch and most of my parents work nights or two jobs to make ends meet. In addition many do not speak English or very limited English and many are refugees. I deal daily with the kind of problems that stem from not getting basic needs met. In the midst of all this I help children express themselves in ways that help them to build a core sense of self. I learned a long time ago that a young child is likely to be more comfortable initially expressing him/herself with art than he/she is going to be at expressing emotions and feelings through words. I stay in at recess and after school trying to keep up with all the needs of my students and after 11 years I still truly love it. Because many young children are more able to express themselves through art and play, I have a lot of art materials in my office. The sewing materials are by far the most popular, with the boys and the girls and I cannot keep up the with demand for supply. A large part of a child's development is being able to be creative and learn how to express themselves. Art therapy such as sewing and embroidery gives children the opportunity to do both in a safe environment. Some common art therapy goals for young children are sensory awareness and integration, problem-solving skills, identification and expression of feelings, and increased self-esteem. At a very young age, children start to develop self-esteem. Mastering a skill such as sewing and embroidery can help to increase their self-esteem and feel more confident. My students crave the soothing effects of art. Being able to provide them with the materials they need to be successful in this medium will increase their ability to develop a new skill that will help increase their self-esteem.

We have students in khaki, black, khaki shorts, etc. They do not own black clothing and in many cases, they cannot afford to get them. The students have at least three competitions a year, and three separate concerts.

Our school is fortunate enough to have a Chromebook cart available for use, the only problem is that there are not enough Chromebooks for all of the students to use at one time. My kids thought that having our own Chromebooks in the classroom would be beneficial for those times that the Chromebook cart is not available to us. We are a school of immigrants and refugees, oftentimes we receive students who are unable to speak English. As such we use the Chromebooks for assignments, research, and extra help. Students are also responsible for assignments and projects that are to be accessed via their student emails. For those students who do not have a computer or internet access at home having the Chromebooks in the classroom allows these students to access all of their materials as needed. Working to put this project together and make it come to life will allow the students to work on multiple skills necessary to succeed in all that they do. Putting this project together has shown my students the importance of working hard to accomplish a goal as a team. They have also worked on their grammar, spelling, and math skills.

Never a day goes by where I do not have to prompt one of my voracious readers to stop reading and pay attention to the lesson. My students love letting their imaginations take flight! Through our independent reading time, they get to travel to far-off places and get 'outside of themselves'. For many of my students, the escapism they experience while reading is life-changing. My students will use these books during our daily independent reading time. During this time, every student is expected to have a high-interest book. Since I work in a small, urban charter school, our library and access to books is limited. My students would be so grateful for the donation of these books to our classroom library. We have all heard that reading 'takes you places'. For many of my students, reading saves them from certain places. Through reading, my students learn about the possibilities of life. They identify with the stories of narrators who have shared their struggles. They identify with new perspectives that, without reading, they would have never been made aware.

Our students come from diverse backgrounds with one goal in common, to learn and progress. We know that once given the appropriate resources our students ability to master skills will soar above and beyond. Our students are both loving and caring children that need just a bit more encouragement. Our classroom is in dire need of a shower curtain in order to make the bathroom usable. In its current state the bathroom is open to the classroom and cannot be used until we cover the opening that once contained a door. The contact paper will help us cover the blackboard whose tarnished appearance distracts our students during our lessons on the rug and the easel is currently being held together by duct tape and we fear that one day it will undue and hurt one of our children. Needless to say any donation will impact our classroom immensely. Our students need a comfortable environment that many of them lack at home.

Puppetry includes engineering, technology, sound design, lighting, music, movement, acting, mathematics, fine art, teamwork, prop making, mask making and many forms of experimentation in the form of design and performance My students are from Flint, MI and the surrounding counties. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. Many of my students come from poverty stricken areas and households. This is the single factor that most of my students have in common. We are about 85% free and reduced lunches. Many come from violent environments, broken and unstable home environments. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. When I get my students in 9th grade the majority have not had an art class since they were very young. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to extremely empathetic to others and we pride ourselves in being heavily involved in our community! With the addition of foam and foam cutting tools my students will be able to design and build light weight puppet bodies. Having a designated tool box for the puppet building class will aid in my students being able to engineer and build props and puppets. We will utilize the clay and clay tools to sculpt heads and body parts for molding and casting. We will utilize heat guns for softening thermoplastics to be used to create masks and puppet heads. Through the process of puppet building and performance my students learn techniques in painting, sculpting, casting, mask making, prop building, music and sound design, anatomy, movement, lighting, set design, acting, choreography, teamwork but also STEM skills (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). These skills transfer into many disciplines and potential job opportunities. We are making professional quality puppets in our class. This means that we use professional tools and supplies that can get expensive. We have some financial support from our school system and PTSO but adding these extra items will create a thriving environment in the room. This will improve the classroom by allowing my students to have ample supplies to really experiment and dive deep into what is possible in terms of puppet design using the proper professionally standard tools and supplies.

'Empowering Students Through Art' is my objective. The videos teach Art, Art History, Careers, and more. The first video I want to use is: 'Who is the Artist? Artist of Pop Art,' It's about Andy Warhol who created tomato soup can paintings along with creating art from everyday objects. Warhol was a commercial artist. My students will learn that everyday objects in life can be created in art. They will be inspired from Warhol to make a creative new kind of soup label to market in art. Perhaps the label could be a Peanut Butter Soup design with dancing peanuts. Maybe it could be Creamy Chocolate Soup, Cupcake Soup, and more. There are many creative ideas to explore. They will enjoy learning about pop art, collaborating, and more with theses amazing videos.

This classroom currently has a wide variety of left over desks and tables that were left over from other schools in our district. While this works, it is not an ideal learning environment. Students sit at desks of different shapes and sizes that do not best allow for group work. We are looking to create a classroom environment that is truly inviting to all students. We hope to arrange our classroom so that students can easily collaborate with one another on projects and academic tasks. These tables will allow us to work with students in a more collaborative manner. Our goal is to help facilitate students in a way so that they can learn from one another. In sixth grade, it's extremely important that students have the chance to interact with one another to complete academic tasks. Students need just as much practice working with one another as they do on their math skills. These tables will allow students to easily collaborate with each other throughout the school day.

I currently have 14 students on my caseload. Disabilities range from Specific Learning Disabilities, to Emotional Impairments, to Other Health Impairments. Each student is working out of interventions to target their reading and math needs. Despite their large educational gap, these children are so eager to learn and be the best they can be. Children always get so excited when able to get their hands on new technology. Having iPads will enhance my students reading and math skills. They will be able to take what they've learned within our interventions and be able to generalize while doing different activities. There are apps that are tied directly to our math intervention, the iPads would allow my students to get extra practice and learn new skills while working with technology.

They will be able to work cooperatively as a team, designing and printing the parts needed to construct their robots, and then program their robot to complete a task. According to Eric, 'Our project is to expand our engineering skills and our knowledge of electronics customization by obtaining two Arduino Starter Kits and two Raspberry Pi 2 Starter Kits. Combining our 3D printer with these kits, we can create a balanced, electronics driven curriculum that inspires ingenuity and opens minds to the vast world of robotics, programming, and the creation of objects that can change the world.' This project is important not only our class, but also to the classes and students below us. We understand that we will be leaving this school at the end of this year, but we also understand that this project will not only benefit our learning during our last year, but will benefit the younger students in the Academically Talented program. This project will solve the main obstacle we currently face with our 3D printer curriculum. We are able to print nice objects for projects, but we are not able to use those objects and parts to program working electronics and robots. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi will allow us that next step in our engineering learning.

After sitting still for hours, finally being able to move around, get your blood flowing and use your muscles? My students come from diverse backgrounds and with many needs but a wide range of skills. They attend a large high school in Oregon, with a wide socioeconomic range. The average student-teacher ratio and minority rate is higher than the state average, and the graduation rate is lower than the state average. Since sports have largely been cut in the middle schools, my high school PE classes are some of the only opportunities they will have to play sports. My PE department recently added a new Recreational Basketball class as a PE elective. Since it has been introduced, the class has become extremely popular and is always fully loaded with students. Unfortunately, the equipment we have is substandard, and does not allow the students much opportunity to improve their skills. The balls we currently have are just rubber balls, and they go flat easily, get slippery, lose traction, and can get too bouncy. The basketballs I am requesting in this grant are known to be long lasting, have a good grip for dribbling and shooting, and are the official game balls many high schools use for their games. The ball bag I am requesting would also allow for a safe place to store the balls when not in use. Having new equipment would really help my students improve their basketball skills and allow this popular PE class to continue. These high quality basketballs will help encourage my students to live a healthy, active lifestyle and have a more enjoyable PE experience.

We, as a school, are working very hard to get them on or above grade level. This is a big challenge, but we care about the students' futures. Technology will help us get there! My students are great! We are always working on a classroom environment where everyone feels loved, valued, and respected. They work hard at school despite some challenges that may be at home. A lot of my students come from the Flint area, which means that running water would be a luxury for them. My students have so much potential to make a big difference in this world, and we are trying our best, as a school, to help them see that. Our school not only cares for our students but also their family and community. Technology is sparse at our school because our Title 1 money is spent on interventionists because our students are coming to us way below grade level. We recently received one iPad from another DonorsChoose.org project, and my students have loved every second of it. If we could have another one in our classroom, we could double the students that could use it. We will be using the iPad in a lot of areas but really focusing on reading and math. My students will be reading a wide variety of books which brings the library to them. My students will also be building their basic math knowledge that is the foundation of math to come. My students like to know that people care. When I told them we had received an iPad for our classroom, they were so excited. I'd love to share that we got another one. Being able to incorporate technology into their foundational reading and math skills is important. Technology is the future, and it helps students relate to the material being presented.

We all perform a warm-up together to get our minds focused on music. Then we learn a new music concept and apply it to our music that we are preparing for a concert. Our school is a 6th-8th grade middle school educating around 780 students. Our population is 91% Hispanic, with 92.6% Socioeconomically Disadvantaged and 39.1% are English Learners. In order to reach these EL (English Learner) students it is important to provide real, relevant and challenging music lessons to provide a well-rounded education where the arts are included in their everyday curriculum. Students will use their imaginations to create music which will help them with self-expression, problem solving, and collaboration. I admire Disneyland Create to INSPIRE my students. My students who play clarinet and saxophone will have the reeds they need to physically play their instruments. One reed only lasts a few weeks so for every student that plays a reed instrument, I need to provide around 10 reeds per year because I teach in such a high poverty location and I cannot ask my students to purchase their own reeds. The disinfectant is for my students that play trumpet, trombone, and baritone. They would use it on the mouthpiece to clean it and keep germs from spreading. With the worksheets my current and future students will be able to learn about famous composers and listen to compositions. Then they will be able to study musical terms and show their progress using the assessments in the book of quizzes. With the Finale program, I can create customized music for my future and current students to work on specific lessons throughout the year. Also anytime I need to rearrange music to work better for my students, I can easily create it using the Finale program. Students in my classroom will learn how to perform music on a band instrument for a hands-on education that builds individual and teamwork skills that will be helpful today and for the rest of their lives. Studies have shown that learning music uses both sides of the brain and helps with math skills that will make them better students at the high school and college level.

My classroom has a few pairs of headphones that are shared among 30 students. But, the websites that our students learn from each day require sound. This learning website is researched-based and has been proven to 'move' students academically. Without sound, this website is a waste of learning time because students can't view the instructional videos. We have been getting by with turning up the volume on the Chromebooks or computers all year, but the amount of noise that creates is very distracting, and students have difficulty hearing their own lesson when 30 other lessons are going on at the same time.

My school is a Title 1 school where ALL students are 100% free breakfast and lunch. This doesn't hold them back from being successful and setting huge goals for their future. Our school is working hard to improve our literacy and math scores. We have taken off using Accelerated Reader, LEXIA, and DreamBox to allow for engaging online programs for them to boost their learning and knowledge. Our technology is limited in our school and we are sharing the materials that we have between classrooms. Our school was built without a computer lab as well, which makes scheduling technology time more difficult. Unfortunately a lot of my students don't have access to the internet or technology items at home and our technology in the classroom is greatly limited. We need to maximize our opportunity to engage and build their 21st century skills during the school day. By having an ipad in the classroom, you will be giving the opportunity for my students to access our online programs and work in small groups on educational apps. Students will be able to explore and make connections to these topics and become stronger learners. First grade is such an important grade to build these foundations so that they can be prepared and successful in the coming grades.

Do you remember rolling and pressing your fingers in the clay? The smell of it? Do you remember creating your first clay pot or clay creation? I want my students to have that exposure too. I want them to explore with play-dough and more. I teach art to a wonderful group of pre-k - 5 students. They enjoy art and are little sponges. When my students see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know what the next art project will be. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms for students in need. We have academic clubs after school, Saturday School, and daily pull-out academic programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. I am requesting play-dough, play sand, trays and molds. Since I teach over 200 primary students who range from ESE Pre- Kindergarten to Second Grade in the arts, these materials are cost-effective. The students can create pinch pot bowls, animals, food items, monsters, people and more. They can even embellish their play-dough or clay creations by using sequins, wiggle eyes, straws, popsicle sticks and pipe cleaners. The students will learn self-expression along with having the freedom to create art which is important. The play sand will help meet the sensory needs of my ESE students. Students will feel successful using these art materials in the art room because they will receive immediate rewards from creation. Most of my students have never experienced working with play-dough or play sand due to their backgrounds. I want to bring them these experiences.

Our school is +90% autistic, currently grades K -10, expanding to K - 12 in a few years. We have sensory breaks every 15-30 minutes, which can be difficult in our small spaces. Our class size is kept at 16 or less, but with a full class and 8 tables, the classrooms do not have room for any movement. We have a wonderful school where everyone works to create a loving learning space for students who are just trying to make it through life.

Our staff works together as a team, using the same expectations for all of our students, yet treating all of our students as individuals. In this specialized environment we can watch our students blossom! With our current tables, the room set-up only allows for different walking spaces. By removing some of the larger tables, and putting in the smaller desks, we can arrange the space so we have an open area where the kids can grab a pillow and read a book, play a game with friends, or just have a mini dance party! Our tables are heavy and bulky, and take time to push to the walls, losing either valuable academic time, or limiting the sensory break. Smaller desks will be easier to move if necessary, or by just taking up less floor space, we are going to create more of an open area. Working with students on the autism spectrum, it becomes necessary to create an atmosphere that is uncluttered. The open floor space allows for less congestion, and less distraction. Some of our students have executive functioning issues. Containing their things in the smaller space will help with their organization as well! Having the additional space by replacing the bulky tables, our students will be able to access sensory breaks in an uncluttered environment. At the same time, our larger tables can be moved to our new building addition, and used as work tables in the new library. This will be a win-win for many students.

My students are 10th graders with great curiosity and desire to be successful in school. They come from a variety of ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. There is great disparity in most of my classrooms. While a few students may be well off and have ample access to technology at home, most only use the computers they have access to at school or the public library. With a recently failed bond, there is no new technology coming to our district and in the meantime, my students are falling behind students in other, more technologically affluent districts. With the current demands of our standards, college readiness indicators, and our global society, it is imperative that my students have constant access to good technology. They will use the Chromebook laptops and licenses to research topics or authors we are studying in class novels. They will produce professional presentations for their peers. They will learn how to decide whether a source they find online is valid or useful. They will watch a variety of online media (poetry performances, film clips, advertisements). They will be able to write often and share their writing with peers to get revision. They will be prepared for their future. Students who have materials that they know are useful to them (both now and in the future) feel empowered and valued.

Every day I am impressed with my students' musical abilities. It saddens me that, due to the low income area of our school, many of these students do not have the opportunity of exploring their talents outside our music classroom. Therefore, I believe it is so important for me to give them as many experiences and paths to explore and refine their inner musician as I possibly can! I love using music to create connections to culture and history. We have a diverse population of students at my school, and recently we've been getting more and more students from African countries where drumming plays a big part in their culture. I would love to make these students feel empowered to share their culture with us through the art of drumming with tubanos!

These six and seven year olds are learning to read, have become writers and have made big gains in math. We are busy all day long, and there's still much to do. My students are in first grade, and enjoy coming to school. They come from a wide variety of living situations. Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. Some of my students live with families that do not help them with their homework, or who appear not to be supportive of education. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives. I am asking for five Kindle Fires kids Editions. These come with a free year of Amazon Free Time Unlimited and a kids proof case. We will be able to use this for reading and math practice. There are many apps available such as books that are read to the students to help them learn fluency, and math games that can reinforce skills taught in class. I plan to use these during reading and math groups. This donation of 5 Kindle Fires will allow my students to practice important academic skills and be exposed to using a touch screen, building their technology skills too. We are coming to state testing, and again this year it is a computer based test. This will continue in the years to come, I'm sure of it. These materials will allow the students more time with technology, and will help prepare them for tests, as well as giving them time to practice reading and math activities.

We are a farming community and I aspire to empower students to reach beyond their tiny, isolated town and interact globally. Building a Makerspace will provide them with the tools to begin their discoveries. My students complain that school doesn't prepare them for the real world. They work on farms or in the barns before school and arrive having spent time in that agricultural world. They mostly do well in school, but that disconnect impacts them and makes this portion of their education seem pointless. Our tiny school does well to provide the basics, but our limited funding can only support small classes, nothing else. My students are thirsty to learn meaningful skills and I yearn to bring the real world to our school. With the requested littleBits Electronics Deluxe Kit my students will learn about electronic circuitry. They'll learn how to build various devices with the Raspberry Pi Electronic Starter Kit, the Arduino Starter Kit and the LittleBits Electronics Kit. They will explore basic programming with the Kano Computer Kit and robotics with Ozobots. Ultimately, they will begin inventing new designs with the Makey Makey set and the Teknikio Activating Origami and Fabtronic Sewing Kits. I envision my students designing and building computers and robots. They can create electrical devices and learn how circuitry works. I will facilitate a new class during our activity periods, a place where students come to create. They can tinker with tools and gadgets, practice programming and problem solving, etc. This exploration will feed a hunger they may not know they need. This makerspace will foster confident builders and thinkers, creators of all sorts. Once they have gained a basic understanding of the necessary components, they will begin to design their own inventions. They will visit various websites to learn more about computer design and robotics, and become part of a global conversation. Donations to this project will provide students with necessary tools to begin their journey. Their successes will be shared throughout our community, so stakeholders will become aware of what engineering and coding projects interests our students.

If you don't practice reading, you cannot develop your literacy skills. I work with students who need access to books in their native language, so they can read, as they learn English. My students are middle schoolers in 4th though 8th grades. All are immigrants from other countries, are learning English, have relocated to an inner-city urban area, and are in an over-crowded school. Most of them are Spanish speakers, and come from families who have limited or no English speakers as well. Most students come from low-income families and qualify for free lunch status. The literacy skills with which they arrive to school vary from very beginning to highly developed. They are still expected to read and keep up with the classroom curriculum, however, and this is very difficult to do in a language they are still in the process of learning. My students are eager to learn and wish to adapt to the culture and language quickly. This is why I need to provide them with access to quality literature in a language they understand. My school district has frozen budgets, which means I am very limited as to what I can purchase for my students, though they need instructional materials. Students will utilize these books to check them out for independent reading, as nightly reading is required as homework. Independent reading at one's instructional level will develop many reading skills, such as comprehension, synthesizing information, questioning, inferencing, summarizing, fluency, and accuracy. Additionally, independent reading will develop students' vocabulary, even in their native language, and this knowledge will transfer to and enhance their English acquisition. Students are often asked to respond to their reading in writing, and frequently they must refer to their texts, but if they cannot truly comprehend what they read because of a language barrier, they will not continue to develop any literacy skills at all because they do not have appropriate materials to use. Books for my students will improve their literacy dramatically, since I only have a modest collection in varying levels for 15 limited-English students. Our school library has a very limited selection of Spanish books too. Students are expected to read daily in class and for homework, and the small selection that I have compiled is not sufficient for these students' use throughout the year.

Students will learn to care for their materials and enjoy the content in a fun way. I try to increase my students' motivation in reading, math, science, and social studies by making learning fun. With creative ideas and fun activities, students begin to make connections between my classroom and real life. The curriculum continues to get harder, and students must have many opportunities for fun. Many materials that students currently use are boring.

My students are 6-7 year olds just beginning their education journey. They come from a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Some of the students qualify for free and reduced price lunch. Having a safe and comfortable place to come and learn is of top priority for me. The Hokki Stools I have chosen will have many different uses in my classroom. The wiggle seats are something I have been wanted to try for a while. They help the students have a comfortable seat to rock or wiggle in while still staying engaged in the lesson.

We are housed in a K-12 alternative school in a rural low income community. More than 80% of our school is on free and reduced lunches so we qualify for Community Program which allows all of our students to receive free breakfast and lunch. All the students that have been placed in my classroom are in the Exceptional Children's Program and have many behavioral issues. The students have many diagnosed disorders that include but are not limited to Autism, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Anxiety, Depression etc. They are great kids that have many unique needs. Several times a day we work specifically on social/behavioral skills. These skills are practiced and reinforced throughout the day. The books and games will allow us to have more options for ways to share social and behavioral norms with the students. The games and tablets will help reinforce social skills such as sharing, teamwork, cooperation, patience, learning new skills and learning how to lose, and managing frustrations and disappointments. My students need multiple opportunities to learn and practice in our classroom environment so they can use these skills outside of our classroom. If the students in my class can learn some of the skills from these books and games, they will have a better chance of transitioning back into the regular classroom. In the year, I have been teaching this class we have already had two students successfully transition back to a regular education classroom. These materials will help my students learn how to control their emotions, and appropriate ways to learn to deal with frustration and anger.

Our school is the main attraction in the community. Most activities revolve around the school. Many of the children come from farming backgrounds or their parents commute to work. My students will use these resources daily. The whole class will benefit from 'brain breaks' that the bubbles and lights will provide. I will have a special sensory corner that students can enter when a break is needed. Students will be able to choose to go there or it can be suggested by me. The balls will be held by anyone that feels that it will help them, I will also suggest it for someone that is struggling. The essential oils will be used to create a calm atmosphere. Students will be able to attend longer with the visual breaks and the sensory tools (balls) will allow students to fidget but maintain focus during a lesson. The sensory corner in the classroom will allow children to take a short break and return to the learning quickly. Some students have meltdowns or lose control when frustrated.

Our student demographic is quite diverse as are the needs and interests of our learners. The vast majority of our students are designated as low-income. Despite obvious social and economic challenges, our students are great young people who envision themselves as being successful. Most of my students are upperclassman who are preparing for post-secondary education. Their dreams and goals are consistent with those of young Americans all across the country. Even though our students live in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world, they very rarely step outside the confines of their own neighborhoods. As a result, their world view is limited by the blinders of a few city blocks. Literature, especially multicultural literature, provides students a window into the lives of others. The purpose of this project is to familiarize my students with Muslim life. While Muslim students represent a small minority in our school, each year their numbers continue to grow. Sadly, many of our Muslim students are bullied. I hope to use the book Ms. Marvel to teach our non-Muslim students that Muslim students are no different than any other student. Since the story’s protagonist is Muslim, I’m hopeful that Muslim students will feel a sense of pride as they see an aspect of themselves represented in the curriculum. Conversely, I’m hopeful that the non-Muslim students will learn respect and tolerance for their Muslim peers. Once individuals learn to look beyond outward differences, they start to see that the similarities we share as human beings are far more important. By learning about others, we often learn about ourselves. If students can recognize that people are people, they will not only respect people that are different but respect themselves, too.

Each group has its own supplies for various activities, lessons, or projects. They have scissors, glue, tape, crayons, markers, calculators, and their interactive science notebooks to keep organized. One of my students suggested to me to get something that can hold those supplies and keep them organized and easily accessible. My students are learning real-life problem-solving skills. They realized that our current system of staying organized with our supplies was not working. They brainstormed and came up with a great solution for the problem. They are learning to become responsible for their materials and learning to maximize their time. We need to organize our supplies. It takes away from our class time to get, use, and clean up our supplies. Many of our supplies get lost or broken when they are left at our group tables. It would be nice to have baskets at our group table to help oragnize all of our supplies so they are easy for us to access and use.

It started out as a catchy phrase but has developed a far deeper meaning. Gahaferland is home to energetic and eager learners. Gahaferland calls a rural, Title 1 school home. In our classroom alone we speak 5 different languages and call several countries home. My students are diverse in socioeconomic background and home environments. Many students do not have Internet access at home, and some live in a mobile home community. I have several gifted and talented students eager to create and learn. Although they come from various backgrounds, one thing they have in common is their enthusiasm to learn. They are an energetic, and a very gracious group. Dash & Dot robots are hands-on learning tools that teach creativity, problem solving, and coding to children. Children can see their code come to life in a real-world, hands-on way that engages them fully in the concepts they are learning about. As robotics and computers become increasingly prevalent in students’ lives, understanding programming concepts is becoming very important for students’ success. Students will work in small groups to develop their collaboration and communication abilities as they learn valuable 21st century skills. Help my students get introduced to STEM early and cultivate their skills for the opportunities of today’s world. The possibilities are endless for these robots and I can’t wait to use them in all subject areas to enrich my student’s learning. My students live in a rural part of our county and many are on free and reduced lunch. Many of them do not have the opportunity to learn through through technology, let alone robots, at home. I want to give them opportunities to learn and grow and develop real world skills. I want all of my students, especially my female students, to feel inspired in the field of science and technology. There are possibilities for me and my students to use the robots in reading, writing, and social studies as well.

Our first grade class is comprised of 25 amazing students, many of whom are full of energy and ready to learn! I truly believe a flexible classroom would help them become more engaged and active learners in the classroom. Our current goal is for every student to have his/her own wobble chair in the classroom. This is a great first step in reaching our overall goal of a flexible classroom. There is ample amounts of research that supports the idea that flexible seating options in the classroom are beneficial to all students especially young learners. Students become more engaged in their learning activities, leading to better grades and test scores when movement is allowed while seated. The Wobble Chair is a simple seat design to allow movement when children are required to sit. 'The Kore Chair is not just a piece of furniture...it's a LIFE-Changer for active kids, kids with ADHD and Autistic kids...Aggressive wobbling on a KORE Chair increases blood to the brain and thereby quiets the requirement for fidgety kids to move...Kids learn better and are more productive...the Kid who may be considered 'Unteachable' is now able to learn!'

The school where I teach is a diverse public high school: 23% of students are African American, 19% Hispanic, 16% Asian, 2% Native American, and 36% Caucasian. Many of my students struggle with challenges outside of school. Over 70% of our students are below the poverty line. Many students are in the foster care system or are homeless. Many are recent immigrants learning English as a second language. I have amazing students who use their diversity and life experiences to their advantage. My students are from Ethiopia, Somalia, Rwanda, Vietnam, Mexico, Guatemala, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Micronesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and other places around the world. This year I teach freshman world history and two sheltered versions of history for English language learners. Some of my students have just moved to the United States and are beginning to learn English. In my class my students will learn about the world and other cultures. As a social studies teacher, I have the opportunity to help students develop essential skills to support them in many areas. My goal is to prepare them for college, career, and other areas.

Many are stuck living in small apartments with a large family and no yard to run around in. Several of my students have ADHD as well. It really is a struggle and constant battle for these students to be in a classroom without moving much throughout the day.

My students are very motivated but many struggle with getting basic needs met at home. 100 percent of them get free lunch and most of my parents work nights or two jobs to make ends meet. In addition many do not speak English or very limited English and many are refugees. I deal daily with the kind of problems that stem from not getting basic needs met. In the midst of all this I help children express themselves in ways that help them to build a core sense of self. I learned a long time ago that a young child is likely to be more comfortable initially expressing himself with art than he is going to be at expressing emotions and feelings through words. I stay in at recess and after school trying to keep up with all the needs of my students and after 11 years I still truly love it. The students at my school come into my office to cool down and relieve anxiety in order to get ready to go back to class and be ready to learn. I need the tools to help them get what they need. The repetitive activities such as sewing and building helps many children relax and focus so they are able problem solve and self sooth. I think for a lot of my students self care such as this must be taught, they don't at first know what it is that helps them to calm down. Art therapy such as sewing and sculpting gives children the opportunity to do both in a safe environment. Some common art therapy goals for young children are sensory awareness and integration, problem-solving skills, identification and expression of feelings, and increased self-esteem. My students crave the soothing effects of art. Being able to provide them with the materials they need to be successful in this medium will increase their ability to develop a new skill that will help increase their self-esteem.

To that end, my goal is to create a classroom that is deserving of them; a place where they feel safe, supported and challenged to go the beyond our four walls and into a world that wants them to succeed. My students need 10 sets of leveled books. As a child, books were my best friends... my partners in adventure. This is what I want for my students. Unfortunately, they don't have an abundance of high interest, leveled books at their disposal. They must rely on our curriculum or books that were donated to our class library. My goal this year is to be able to provide as much opportunity for my students to fall in love with reading as possible. An inviting and well-stocked classroom library has the capability of turning the most reluctant reader into a book lover. Adding new, high-interest titles will help reach my goal of having a classroom library that my students are excited to explore and fall in love with.

I have been fortunate enough to teach ESL (English Second Language) for 2 years in a predominantly Hispanic classroom. Last year I had a diverse group of students in regards to abilities. This coming year, I am so excited to meet my students and see the array of different cultures, abilities, talents, and traits that will highlight my 2nd-grade classroom. Every school year, I begin by making sure my classroom includes 3 important characteristics: safe for all learners, bright and eye-catching (for student engagement), and comfortable. My students should be able to come to class each and every day and be excited to learn, comfortable to expand their minds and think outside the box (environmentally and socially speaking), and feel safe enough to open up and be a creative thinker and sharer. In such a diverse community of learners, I am able to really build our classroom around the students' cultures and backgrounds. I learn so much about others and in turn, I learn about myself through the eyes of each student. Teaching is my passion, but I will always consider learning to be my life. As the school year approaches, I hope to get my students the materials that they need in order to succeed. My classroom theme this year will be Owls. In order to give the students the accessories and tools they need, such as name tags for their desks, classroom rules, binders, and paper, I would like to make them themed and engaging for students! It will give them a sense of ownership and participation as a class and as a team. I would also like for my early childhood learners to feel a sense of pride in their work as it is displayed on classroom bulletin boards and school bulletin boards.

However, our students and their families did not lose hope and stood behind our band program. We opened the program up to grades 5th through 8th and had almost 100% show interest in participating. However, many had to be turned away because they were unable to rent instruments. The majority of our parents were willing and excited to have their child learn an instrument, but were unable to afford the cost to rent or purchase an instrument. The bell kits will be given to students interested in playing percussion, but that would be unable to participate in band because of their inability to afford the rental fee.

First off, having students use dry erase boards for doing work will minimize the amount of paper being used in the classroom. Students will use the boards at their seats and on the rug and will use them for many different purposes. These purposes include: math problems, making tables to help with math, instead of scrap paper during tests, practicing drawing shapes, practicing spelling words, writing sentences, and more. It will also help me as an educator to do informal assessments quickly and efficiently by asking students to write an answer on a board and then quickly showing me. The map will be used for geography purposes. Students throughout the year will be researching where their family originated from; this is important especially for my class because they are so diverse. This map will show students which part of the world they are from. Students will also refer to the map to look for any place if it is brought up in a book or if the student is simply curious.

When reading is nurtured soon after birth, literacy develops naturally and children can become readers almost miraculously. 'Children are made readers on the laps of their parents.' ~ Emilie Buchwald My school educates a diverse population of approximately 350 students in grades PreK - 4. My school is a nurturing community of dedicated teachers led by a principal committed to literacy and promoting joyful reading experiences. I am a Reading Specialist and work as a Basic Skills Teacher for students that are identified as at-risk or experiencing reading difficulties. My students are eager and enthusiastic. They are hard-working and resilient. The older students are, the more difficult it is to remediate reading difficulties. We work to provide targeted intervention as early as possible. Often my learners come to school in Kindergarten without the necessary literacy experiences. Many families are not aware that the critical time for brain development is birth - age 4 and that the #1 best thing that they can do to support their children's learning is to read to and talk with them at home. This project will make an investment in our future population by supporting our families as soon as their children are welcomed into the world. Many families do not have books at home. I would like to encourage reading at home for our future students. I can do this by supporting the families that have children already enrolled in my school. Creating 'Welcome to Literacy' baskets is my vision for getting this message out to families early. Whenever a student currently enrolled in my school welcomes a sibling to the family, they will be provided with a welcome basket of reading goodies ~ board books, developmental stacking blocks, a baby product, and literature modeling the importance of reading and talking to babies beginning at birth! Research supports the dynamic impact that reading to children can make on literacy development. I am hopeful that by extending our educational partnership to our students' infant siblings, we will help to lay a stronger foundation for our youngest readers!",My students need a home collection of popular board books in English and Spanish and developmental learning toys to support cognitive growth.,"Health & Sports, Literacy & Language",Grades PreK-2,Books,621.38,Fully Funded

Our school is large with about 1700 students, so often my kids get lost in the shuffle and find themselves slipping through the cracks. No two days are alike and we are a fun, busy classroom. Students work on Chromebooks (purchased with Donor's Choose), read quietly, work on their Algebra, play with a Rubix Cube, fiddle with a yo-yo, and complete work from their 'outside,' or general education classes. Our school does lots of incentive programs and contests, but with it being so large, our class gets lost in the mass chaos that is our population. I want to always make sure to have our own class contests and recognition opportunities for my students so they don't lose motivation toward reaching their goals. Our high school is large, and while there are opportunities for students to win prizes for attendance and grades, my 12 students often get lost in the big campus. I want to make sure that I provide them the same opportunities as their general education peers. If students feel they get rewarded for their efforts, they are more likely to continue to try and make improvements both academically and behaviorally. In my class, I give students the opportunity to earn high-value items for perfect attendance, improved grades, and decreasing their tardies. Students will use the earbuds to listen to their music privately or do their math online work. Students are always in need of backpacks and the bluetooth speakers are still another incentive for them to earn in the classroom contests and incentive opportunities. Wireless mice are helpful because sometimes it's hard to use the Chromebooks without a mouse. I try to prevent frustrating situations from occuring in my class as much as possible.

My students will use these sets of books during guided reading time when they get support in a small group from a teacher. Because the book sets are at a variety of levels, I will be able to work with students at their just-right reading levels. These books will also be used during independent reading time, allowing groups of students to support one another as they practice their reading together.

da67acee1eab5b131613383e2963fc95,Living the Past: Historical Fiction Genre Study,"'Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.' -Helen Keller. Therein lies the power of the classroom, and any teacher worth their salt knows that forming a community--particularly a reading community--is the foundation to a great year. My students are bright and willing, but need assistance in terms of literacy resources and experiences, which is why I am constantly on the lookout for great books to read together. Most of my students come from families with two working parents. As a working mom with two children of my own, I often lament my family's loss of reading time to the demands of just making it through the day. Reading, in my opinion, is mistakenly considered a solitary activity. You may take the words in through your own eyes, but I believe so much is lost if you don't share everything that happens after that--the joy, surprise, confusion, frustration and reward of reading good books. I want to create these opportunities in school, for this is what creates lifelong readers. If my project is funded, my students will participate in a genre study of historical fiction. Students will be able to chose an historical novel that interests them and read in small groups of 3-4, while together we will use our selections to examine the genre and its traits. It is important that students are exposed to and immersed in many kinds of print and many types of literature. A genre study is one way to accomplish that. I chose the genre of historical fiction as one way to support history standards. Our past is too vast and complicated to be covered in one history class per year; reading historical fiction not only brings the past to life, but it also exposes children to parts of history that may not be covered adequately in their course of social studies. Additionally, my students will read primary sources and informational texts associated with the time-preiod of their chosen novel, which adds another element of genre exposure (fiction v. non-fiction). Ultimately, a genre study will allow us to not only enjoy historical content, but also to 'compare and contrast a fictional portrayal of a time, place, or character and a historical account of the same period as a means of understanding how authors of fiction use or alter history.'

Private music lessons are very expensive and out of reach for most of our students. The student body is made of mostly minorities. I want to ensure that our students here are receiving just as many opportunities as those who can afford private lessons and go to a school with more money/supplies. Ukuleles will serve to help students learn an instrument closely related to the guitar but that is small enough for all hand sizes. We received a new curriculum for grades K-5 but nothing for 6th grade. The one thing I did find in my new curriculum was a special Ukulele Project. This project will help to capture 6th graders attention and will serve to improve music literacy. Ukuleles are also similar to guitars but much smaller fitting everyone's hands.

When I think of preschool I think of the amazing group of kids that I have the privilege to teach. I teach a preschool special education classroom full of students with wonderful personalities.

Teaching preschool is not that different from a one-man show; you play the role of teacher, mom, nurse, and more on a daily basis. One of the most difficult things about preschool is learning HOW to learn in preschool. For many of my students this is the first time they have been away from their parents. I believe that this age learns best through play and I try to incorporate play into our day as much as possible. With so many different needs, it can be hard to find all the materials you need.

Maybe is was a different book that was special for reasons only you could understand. As a student, your teachers helped you to find, read, and enjoy books you loved. There is nothing more exciting for students than to feel like an independent reader. A listening center is a great way for students to achieve this independence.

It comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time Unlimited and a kids' proof case. We will be able to use this for reading and math practice. There are many apps available such as books that are read to the students to help them listen to fluency, and math games that can reinforce skills taught in class. I plan to use these during reading and math groups. This donation of a Kindle Fire and accessories will allow my students to practice important academic skills and be exposed to using a touch screen, building their technology skills too.

In a nutshell, Expeditionary Learning provides students with an interdisciplinary education connected to character and community. An integral component of a student’s education at our school is through “Learning Expeditions”, in-depth studies of a compelling topic tied to literacy standards. These Learning Expeditions go hand in hand with field work experiences within our local community to further investigate and explore real world connections. We think our third grade students are extraordinary minds working to solve these real world problems. With 87% minority students, 68% of the students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch, new immigrants from Mexico, Syrian refugees, students in transitional housing, and a multitude of languages spoken, our students bring their insight and diverse background experiences to the problem solving table. We believe that these students are changing the world. Our dream is for our entire third grade to attend an overnight three-day program at the Keystone Science School in the mountains of Colorado. This project will cover a portion of the cost of this field trip. This Spring, our third grade students will be engaging in a three-month long learning expedition to explore our urban watershed and nearby creek’s water quality, and come up with a plan to take action in our community to improve the quality of the Creek that runs along the back of our school. Our creek is part of a larger watershed, one that begins in the mountains and ends in the Gulf of Mexico. By engaging in the learning at the source of our watershed, students will gain the knowledge to understand water on a global scale. Our dream is to have our students work alongside scientists at Keystone Science School to learn the necessary background knowledge and skills to tackle water issues. This three-day experience at Keystone Science School is pivotal to shaping our students into scientists. We will take this content back to the classroom and our nearby creek, making connections between the world around us and our community.

Every day I am impressed with my students' musical abilities. It saddens me that, due to the low income area of our school, many of these students do not have the opportunity of exploring their talents outside our music classroom. Therefore, I believe it is so important for me to give them as many experiences and paths to explore and refine their inner musician as I possibly can!Through previously funded DonorsChoose projects, I have acquired 5 sets of tubano drums in various sizes, as well as a couple of gathering drums. To have a complete class set of tubanos, I need just one more set of 3! Our classroom will then have 18 tubanos, enough for a class of 32 students. Studies have shown that drumming reduces stress, lowers blood pressure, and lifts mood - it's fun, it's physical, and it's easy for anyone to do! We all know that kids these days have more stress on them than they should.

Despite their backgrounds, they come to school every day ready to learn. One of their favorite classes in school is Computers, where they get to use the technology most of them don't have access to at home. Technology is a language that translate well with my students, and it helps them get a deeper understanding of the material they are learning. Chromebooks are another way for students to receive extra time and attention on certain skills while having fun at the same time! Adding a computer center into our rotation will give my students an opportunity to use curriculum-based games to strengthen certain areas of need. It also foster a sense of independence and responsibility in our classroom. Many of my students come from homes with limited or no access to a computer and their only opportunity is at school.

However, my students face daily challenges that include poverty, housing conflicts, unstable households, violence and crime. The majority of my students have witnessed a murder or heard that a family member or close friend was killed. All of my students receive free and reduced lunch and sometimes, this is the only hot meal they will eat. This is their reality. The students at my school are learning what it means to be given restorative justice. They are being trained on how to solve problems and forgive. Our students know that when harm has been done, we need to sit down and discuss it with everyone that is involved. My students need ten packs of various colored project/cardstock paper to complete memorable conflict resolution projects and activities inside our Resolution Room. These materials will help encourage our students to make the right choices, continue to participate in class, remain engaged, and be successful in school. We teach our students conflict resolution strategies and have them complete activities and projects in our Resolution Room in order to come to a solution. Some of these projects may be a letter to each other, detailed drawings of the incident that took place, resolution ideas and suggestions, and many more paper-based activities and projects. In addition, many of our students lack motivation in their classrooms and tend to turn to misbehavior to seek attention. Research shows that when you are proactive and have students take part in tracing back, reflecting, and solving the behavioral issues, students are more likely to behave in the future. Our school would benefit from project paper in order to complete Conflict Resolution projects when behavioral damage has been done. This paper will help motivate our students to make the right choices on a daily basis. They will also be a reminder that we are paying close attention to their choices and including them in the restorative process.

We also use the headphones to do slide shows and other projects. Its nice to be able to use them and hear what videos or sound effects we can add to our slide shows. We sometimes use videos to help us complete projects so it is so important to hear the directions to do our work. Some of these projects include code.org and projects in Scratch.

Water is something many people take for granted in day to day life. However at our school, water is a common complaint amongst our students. Many of our students opt to not drink any water during the day rather than drink the warm tinted water that comes from our water fountains. The students at our school come from low-income homes making it hard to fund projects like this even though new water fountains would greatly help all of the students and staff in our school. The students have classes such as Physical Education that involve physical activity and staying hydrated is important. The students at our school spend all day working to ensure that they pass their classes and have a future, yet they are unable to have access to clean none the less cold water. Hydration is essential to life. Sadly, our students don't take the time or have the desire to properly hydrate themselves during school. The reason is simple. Bad water. The students hate drinking the dirty, warm water that our school water fountains provide. The students will have a better understanding of how important water is to their learning and health if they had cold, clean, filtered water at their disposal on a daily basis. The water bottle filler fountains also provide a green, waste free option which will help the environment in which the students live. Understanding how important it is to drink clean water and how important it is to save water, will give our students a better understanding of how they can help others who are in need of clean water and ways they can conserve and waste less. We are trying to get three cold filtered water bottle stations (one on each floor of our school) installed at our school. As members of the School Wellness Council our responsibility is to find ways to make our school and community healthier. Drinking clean, filtered, cold water throughout the school day is one way we want to help our community and school. Plus the water stations are waste free and thus saves our environment in the process. We are planning on selling water bottles for the Parent Teacher Student Association that will help raise funds for the PTSA. We will be responsible for collecting the money and promoting the use of the water bottles in the new water stations. We will also be educating our peers in the importance of staying hydrated throughout the school day. This information will be created and given during a school wide event by us students in the School Wellness Council. We believe that since our peers don't drink the school's water they instead are either drinking the 'sugar' free sodas provided in our school's vending machines or they are drinking nothing at all during the entire school day. We believe that providing water bottle stations that produce clean, filtered, cold water will increase the amount of water our peers will drink.

Our students come from a variety of different economic backgrounds with a large percentage of our students receiving free breakfast and lunch. We are an ethnically diverse school with language barriers as diverse as our varied backgrounds. Students are offered after school sports teams but many students need an outlet or club to be apart of to keep them busy after school. My classroom hosts a games club to get students to interact and participate after school in a safe, fun way that allows them to make friends and gives them a place to spend quality time after school. Their interactions allow them to work on problem solving skills and peer relationships. I have purchased games and my colleagues and friends have donated games but many are in less than good shape. Also, I can always use more games so kids are not waiting for games to play and losing interest in being here. I have students currently come after school to play games as a way to provide a safe and educational experience. Many students go home to empty houses or rarely get to experience the fun of working with peers on a game or puzzle and lose the social skills involved with such activities. Giving kids a place to fit in and have fun with peers is important in helping them shape and develop social skills, as well as provide a safe place to do such things. Offering an after school club such as this opens the possibility to every student in the school (over 700 students!) to have a place to go after school and become involved in a positive thing.

I spend countless hours (and money) making my classroom accessible for all types of learners. I am continuing to further my education, and am currently working towards my second Masters Degree in Technology in the Classroom. This year I have a wonderful class of 23 third-graders.

I was hooked on DonorsChoose.org after hearing about it over the summer, and just completed our first project! My project of 'Project Spacious Carpet' was fulfilled, and my third graders are now enjoying a nice, new carpet! An important skill for my third graders to learn is organization. For that reason, I am fundraising to raise money towards seat organizers, called 'Seat Sacks,' for the back of their chairs. In these, I plan on having students store their library books and morning journals that are used every day. The 'Seat Sacks' are color-coded to match the color table students belong to. These colors are also featured on our new classroom carpet to indicate where students can sit. As you can tell, I am a bit obsessive about ORGANIZATION!

We just don't have enough. Physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited. My students learn best through singing, movement, speech, creating and performing on instruments so increasing the amount of instruments will increase student learning and understanding.I teach 600 students in grades K-5, and they come to me for 45 minutes once a week. My school is a Title I school in a military town. Military families many times will move away due to orders or deployments, but often return 1 to 3 years later. Students at my school are eager to learn and are most excited about performing on instruments and creating and performing their own compositions.I use a variety of approaches to teach concepts in my classroom, however, the majority of my classes are taught through the Orff approach. Students learn through exploration and creating. With this additional barred instrument, students will be able to contribute to the creation and/or performance of a piece of music and help to accompany other students who are singing or performing on other instruments. Currently, our classroom only has three out of seven bass bars. Because of this, the bass bars do not get utilized as much as they should. While adding one more instrument may seem insignificant, having one more Orff instrument (bass bar) will allow more students to participate in an activity. This will reduce time and the number of groups switching out on instruments. An additional instrument will impact students by allowing them more learning opportunities and more time to appreciate those opportunities.

Despite many difficulties the students are very excited about learning and are very well behaved students. The students are eager to read and are constantly wanting me to sit and listen to them read. However, many struggle with basic sight words. I have found the students really enjoy reading or trying to read the Dr. Seuss books, which are full of sight words. The classroom has a great selection of leveled books. However, we have very few book options that are fun enjoyable books. Therefore, it is hard to teach the joy of reading when most of the books are for educational teaching purposes. I feel very strongly about trying to get good books in the hands of our students. I have always been a big fan of Dr. Seuss. However, I have only had a few copies of his books for my class. My students share my passion for Dr. Seuss and I would like to provide them with their own copies to use during the year. This will help them with their sight words and their reading fluency.

Our school has always been able to achieve high fitness scores due to quality instruction and student performance. Mountain biking is an activity that most of my students never get to do due to the urban location of our school. Traffic is too heavy for parents to feel it safe to ride to school but our school has over 50 mountain bikes that our Physical Education students get to ride on campus. We need more helmets as ours are over 10 years old and several have broken so we do not have a class set. Research has shown that physical activity is also a main contributor to students academic success and we support that success through biking on campus.

Many of their parents work 2 or 3 jobs to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. Most are here on time every day and helpful to their classmates and schoolmates. The Cuisenaire rods allow children to explore quantitative patterns. For example one green rod is half of a white rod, but 10 white rods make 1 yellow rod. This means 1 white is 1/10 of 1 yellow unit but 1/2 of green unit (colors may not match). When children can see this exploration in a concrete manner, it helps immensely. The document camera will allow me to show student work immediately. They will also be able to show concrete models of their mathematical thinking.

My students are inquisitive and love to ask questions and look for answers, especially about nature and animals. Later this spring we will begin a science and language arts unit on Amazing Creatures that my students are already anticipating! They love to learn about large animals, scary looking sharks with big teeth, and ask and answer questions about the dinosaurs. With these materials my students will be able to enhance their study of animals. The Animals Magnetic Activity Tin will allow students to sort and classify animals while using new science vocabulary. As they work the puzzles they will use problem solving skills and learn about sea animals and insects. We will use the books in small groups as students practice non-fiction reading strategies. The books will also be available for students to use during self-selected reading and to choose as take-home books for homework. Sharing their new learning with families is exciting and brings families into what we are learning at school, too! I will set up a science station with the model animals and students will be able to 'play' with the animals in their habitats, learning about how the animals find food and water. Another station will have the life cycle models for students to sequence and write about in blank books that I will provide. The 3D models of theses life cycle stages will be much more engaging than the black and white pictures that come with our science curriculum. Kindergartners love to touch, manipulate, and talk about what they are learning about. I try to make as much learning as possible hands-on for my students. Taking science out of a 30 minute whole group lesson into our independent center time and also integrating it into our language arts lessons makes it more exciting and real for the students.

My kiddos cannot afford their own yoga mats and neither can our school's limited school counseling and health budgets. We have been forced to either stick with chairs, use small classroom spaces throughout the room, or use the music room where there is old carpeting. The magical and special element of each student have his or her own mat to use during YogaCalm instruction would be such an amazing, positive sensory addition for our yoga work. Having a mat enhances the unique and individualized experience for the children, and I would be able to introduce dried flowers, scented oils, leaves, stones, and other natural elements into my YogaCalm lessons if the kids had provided mats.

They bring many different views since there home life is very different from each other. They enjoy coming to school each day and are ready to learn even when dealing with obstacles at home. They are very energetic and caring. There are many role models in the class. They are hardworking and want to learn. All of them participate in different activities and enjoy trying something new. Also, they like science. They are a unique bunch of students!These arts supplies (watercolors, trays, mold and play moon sand, paintbrushes and magnetic hooks) will give students the opportunity to practice and use their art skills. Since students are low income they may not have access to any art supplies at home. We do many different art projects throughout the year using watercolors and paintbrushes. We use the paintbrushes and watercolors to make murals, lines for texture, and to show how to create shadows in a painting. Students also connect the pictures they paint to writing and write about what they created. The trays are used so students can paint on them and the magnet hooks are so students can display their artwork in the classroom and feel proud of what they created. These supplies give students a chance to express themselves through art who may not have the chance to do it at home. It is great to be able to do art and get exposure to that. It also gives students a chance to feel successful in a subject who may not get that feeling in reading, writing, or math.

This is my fifteenth year in the classroom and this is the most impressive class I've taught yet. They prefer hands on projects and enjoy taking risks. This class perseveres when tasks are challenging. As a member of the committee to create a school wide makerspace I was inspired to create a classroom makerspace for my students. A makerspace is a place where students can share ideas, engage with materials, and create collaboratively based on their interests and unique skills. The comic book series Howtoons is an incredible series that promotes student STEM projects at home and at school. By presenting science, math, and engineering challenges through the dynamics of a graphic novel students will be engaged and excited to lead their own makerspace projects.

Kindergarten is an exciting experience for most children, but for my students, all of whom come from a high-poverty neighborhood, it is a chance to escape what may be a negative environment. Our classroom is a safe haven that gives these wonderful students the chance to become explorers, critical thinkers, mathematicians, scientists, authors, artists, and caring, responsible friends. Their excitement for learning is something that I truly wish to nurture and develop into a lifelong passion for education. I do not let the obstacles of minimal to no resources discourage me on this mission. It only motivates me to strive harder to provide them the best and most comprehensive education possible. My students have a daily mathematics period, where they get to learn new skills such as adding, subtracting, and place value. We do not have textbooks for math so as a teacher I always look for the most engaging ways to introduce these topics. My students will benefit from having interactive math centers, in which they can use mathematical reasoning to apply the skills we learn in class. Mathematical reasoning is not just about solving equations. These operations activity centers allow students to use counters, draw models, or mental math to solve given problems. The place value center will give my students the solid foundation of understanding how the base ten system and place value work, so they can apply this knowledge in all future grades. Lastly, an important skill in kindergarten math is to be able to quickly solve sums of ten. This skill is the crucial prior knowledge needed for regrouping in subtraction, that comes in first grade.

We write stories, letters, personal narratives, informational pieces, opinions, poems, and more. The most basic materials we need are pretty simple: pencils and paper. We have pencils and paper already, but to keep our writing workshop running smoothly, we need a high quality pencil sharpener to help keep our pencils sharp and ready to write.

Children come and go throughout the day and throughout the year. Meeting every child's individual academic and social needs is a fun challenge. My day is never boring! My students are a wonderful group of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders attending a high-poverty, urban elementary school. They have a wide range of disabilities that make it challenging for them to learn exclusively in a general education setting. They come to my room for small group instruction in reading, writing, math, and/or social skills. Most of my students are also English language learners. My students rely on consistent routines and access to models and visual examples of the tasks they are completing. They depend on engaging learning experiences that meet them at their individual instructional levels and tap into their personal interests. Most importantly, they depend on having access to the resources that support their individual instructional needs. My biggest challenge as a special education teacher is providing my students with an ever-changing supply of reading materials at their individual reading levels and interests. My school's community is very supportive of all of our learners, but our budget is very tight. While we are fortunate to have a great leveled library, it doesn't have enough breadth for my learners, who take longer to progress from one reading level to another. Likewise, the titles that span the 2nd and 3rd grade reading levels are unlikely to appeal to my older students. In order to read more, they need access to reading material that piques their interest. That's where Storyworks and Time For Kids come in. Every week, my students will have access to Time For Kids' quality, up-to-date news, social studies, and science articles that are relevant for kids of all ages. Monthly, they will receive Storyworks literary magazine, packed full of fiction and non-fiction passages from well-known and up-and-coming authors, often paired with non-fiction passages or poems. With these high-quality resources I'm sure not to run out of materials for my learners. These materials will ensure that my students have non-stop access to high-quality reading material that will pique their imaginations and encourage them to read more, which is key to reading success.

I want to set my students up for success by providing them with organization skills in kindergarten that will last them throughout their years in school. My students are from Northeast Houston. They come to school excited to learn and work hard everyday. One of my goals is to show them how to be more organized, in order to help them be more successful throughout school. Most of my students come to kindergarten without ever going to preschool and some have never been away from Mom or Dad. The school environment is new to them and their success depends on keeping all of their materials organized. Organization is a skill they must learn early on in school. In kindergarten students are expected to learn how to read beginner books, fluently complete math facts and write readable stories. All of these tasks require different materials that students need to be able to sort between. These chair sacks will put students on the right path towards becoming autonomous and able to take control of their own learning. Students will use these chair sacks everyday in class to hold books, folders, notebooks, as well as pencils, crayons, and erasers. Students will learn how to keep their materials organized by being responsible for their individual chair sacks. Each day in our classroom we transition between multiple different subjects including phonics, reading, writing and math. Students will be able to make this transition much more smoothly with all of their materials conveniently located on the back of their chair in one of these chair sacks. Transitions take up a lot of time in any elementary classroom. I am hoping to minimize transition time in my classroom with these chair sacks. Shorter transitions means more time actually spent learning. Every minute for my students is precious and the more minutes we can spend learning rather than transitioning will greatly increase their achievement. Donating to this project will make a huge difference in my classroom by saving transition time and helping my students become more organized and self sufficient. With these chair sacks we will be able to focus more time on learning rather than organization and transitions because these chair sacks will make organization easier for my students.

My students attend a kindergarten center, which houses 15 kindergarten classrooms under one roof. It is AMAZING! With 360, five and six years-olds in one location we have the unique opportunity to adapt our building to meet their specific needs. In my class, I have 23 exceptional students who come from a variety of backgrounds and social experiences. My school district is located in a high poverty area with 58% of our students receiving free or reduced lunch and many qualifying for English as a Second Language support. A number of my students' families struggle to meet essential needs and live far from comfortable lives.57,420 is the number of minutes my kindergarten students spend in my classroom. Considering that they spend more awake time at school than at home, I want to make sure our space is comfortable and inviting for all learners; especially those who come from unstable homes. One way to create an inviting, student-centered classroom is to offer flexible seating to meet the ever diverse needs of my students. The movement provided through wobble chairs and stability balls will allow students to 'get wiggles out' and find a 'just right' seat for their minds to grow and learn. As John Dewey once said, “If we teach today how we taught yesterday, we rob children of tomorrow.” The children that enter my classroom have different needs than those 30 years ago so I want my classroom to reflect that change.",My students need seating that allows for movement and flexibility so their minds can grow.

We start every morning with breakfast in the classroom, preparing our bodies and minds for a busy day learning through play. Because many of my students are labeled as 'at-risk' of not graduating, we make the most out of every moment we have together, making sure every activity planned is pushing them towards success.

My favorite parts of teaching are reading aloud amazing books and playing partner games! I try to include a read aloud in every subject multiple times a week, and we play lots of games in the classroom to build reading and math skills! To continue the fun at home, I print games monthly to send home for them to play with family. I believe these games are more appropriate than homework and contribute to quality family time. Many of my students ask to take home supplies from our classroom to complete their homework and games that I have sent home, such as crayons and dice. I would like to create a 'Kindergarten Success Packet' to share with parents at our beginning of the year Parent Night. This packet will include an alphabet picture book for students to begin building a home library, as well as sight word flash cards, printed alphabet, and math games, and the basic supplies they need to play each game. The dry erase sleeves, expo markers, dice, and game counters will allow students to play their favorite games repeatedly. Each month I would like to create a video for parents with information about what we are learning at school and introduce a new set of games, and a new picture book to add to their growing collection. With this project, I envision families gathered around the table, playing math racing games and CVC reading games; students and parents are building a bedtime routine that includes important family bonding time and a bedtime story.

That is because people don't know how amazing my students are. I teach in a low income/high-poverty school with a high immigrant population. My students often struggle with language and a lack of resources (such as books) at home. Yet they come every day with a thirst for knowledge. As an 8th grade teacher, the key to keeping students engaged is to relate their learning to their own struggles. It matters to them -- if it is about them. I love teaching English, because there are so many engaging, relatable stories written for and about the teenage experience. But my students won't read books at home if I don't provide them. This project will allow me to send home books with my classes for at home reading practice. Many of my middle school students like to tell me that they don't read. But what if they could see themselves in the characters they read about? What if they could relate to the struggles of the characters on the page? Would they change their minds about the importance of books? I know that if provided with the right books to take home, my students will experience a change in attitude about reading. My goal for my students is for them to develop a reading habit through books which they find relatable, engaging, and appealing. I've picked 3 selections to rotate among my classes for nightly take-home reading. The Maze Runner is a dystopian novel where a boy named Thomas finds himself trapped in the center of a maze with no memory of his previous life. It is a compelling adventure story in which the main character must not only survive, but escape. The Giver is a story about a boy, Jonas, who lives in a society where grief and discord have been eliminated and 'sameness' is a virtue. Jonas struggles as he learns the painful truth of individuality and emotion. Last, A Wrinkle in Time is a classic science fiction novel about a girl named Meg, an awkward teen who struggles in school. She must travel across time and space to save her Father and her younger brother from a dark force trying to take over the universe. All of these selections have teenage protagonists who struggle in some way with survival and navigating through the difficult circumstances of life.

I have students who rock and sometimes fall out of their traditional classroom chairs (which are mismatched and damaged). My classroom seating is in desperate need of a 21st Century makeover. Our seating needs to match our collaborative student-centered curriculum. Wobble chairs help improve posture and allow wiggly first grade students a chance to move and learn. The Gaiam Kids Balance Ball Chairs also offer the students an opportunity to choose seating that is comfortable for them. These chairs also improve posture, and the frame that holds the balance balls in place are a more stable option for first grade students.

I appreciate how hard they work for me each day, and I know they'd appreciate any support you could give them. The best way I've found that students can build tolerance is through conversations with their fellow classmates. These conversations are elevated when they are sitting at a table. Long gone are desks in my room. They've been replaced with tables and stools. I'm asking for two more cafe tables and tall stools to make my class complete. My students love to move around the classroom. These cafe tables and chairs allow them to relax and have deeper conversations to understand each other better. I've listened to more cooperative discussions at these tables. They'll use them to sit at during class lessons, working on projects, wordprocessing on their Chromebooks. I can only hear the conversations now with two more tables and stools. They'll be conversations about classwork but mainly about each other and respecting each other's opinion and valuing their information as they develop their tolerance for one another.

As with many Title I schools, some students have experienced upheaval, trauma, and poverty in their young lives, which can be daunting. However, my students, whom I've just met, have shown great enthusiasm for learning music. I would like them to have opportunity to experience the joy of playing musical instruments. Learning an instrument facilitates students learning self-discipline, requiring focus and repetition, even when it seems tedious. An additional benefit of playing an instrument is it can help build a child's self-esteem. The joy of playing an instrument and becoming a musical being is a feeling all students can recognize, participate in and have fun doing. Carl Orff (composer of Carmina Burana) and Gunild Keetman developed an approach for elementary music called Orff Schulwerk. In the Orff music room, students combine music with movement, speech and drama. Barred instruments, such as xylophones and glockenspiels, are an integral part of an Orff experience. Altos compliment the sopranos and add a warm, rich tone to any song or movement activity. Students love having kinesthetic learning experiences, especially if it's with an instrument.

Some are hungry. Some are tired. And, some just want a hug. Home life can be stressful, but at school, they can look forward to learning, friendships, food, and plenty of encouragement. For some of my students, our classroom is the one place they can count on for routine, safety, and community. Let's work together to bring these sweet students some joy in their education by creating a safe place for them to be innovative, creative, and think outside of the box!I am requesting several different choices of seating arrangements for the students in my Writing and Social Studies classroom in order to meet their physical needs. I would love to do away with standard school chairs and replace them with ways for my students to get their bodies and minds moving such as bouncy bands and stools. Every child in my classroom has different physical needs, and I desire to create an environment of acceptance and tolerance through flexible seating. Whether it's a case of the wiggles or an itch to move, my students would greatly benefit from stools, a computer chair, a bench, and bouncy bands. For the past five years of my teaching career, I have seen kids 'eye' other students who have to stand during class or need to go on a quick walk to move around. I have heard comments made under their breaths about the differences in how students work. This was made possible by having conventional desks and chairs where any slight difference for one or two students is very noticeable. This cannot continue. I have to change my classroom environment. I would love to help students understand that everyone has different physical needs, and that is totally okay! Over the past few months I have been collecting exercise balls, standing desks, and bicycle peddlers in an attempt to create an accepting environment. But, I still need more supplies to make this dream come true! I am asking for your help in creating a classroom where everyone is able to learn in their own way. I am asking for your help in creating a classroom where students can feel safe, comfortable, and normal. I am asking for your help in creating a classroom of tolerance.

With shrinking school budgets it is getting harder and harder to provide students with the basic school supplies that are needed to learn. My students will be using these materials daily, they do not always get new materials so having new and unused materials to start out the year will be amazing! Markers, crayons, colored pencils, pencils, erasers, oil pastels, paint brushes, mini stamp markers, graph paper and glue are essential supplies to any classroom. These supplies will be used in every aspect of the classroom. My students will use these materials during math, reading, writing, art and so many other areas throughout the year.

It is a blessing to spend my days at this beautiful community school in the spectacular mountains of western North Carolina. My drive to work is full of beautiful landscapes. My school is small (kindergarten through fifth grade), with fewer than 150 students. We may be small, but our dreams are big. The community is deeply invested in the education and the nurturing of each student. Economic status does not provide a barrier to learning, instead, it provides a challenge this school accepts on a daily basis.

This right brain – left brain integrating bot builds both creativity and coding skills in children. It is my plan to have my students advance from basic color coding to intermediate block-based programming with Bit. Students can draw lines with the special markers, create obstacles and create color codes to control the Ozobots. This project is inspired by a project previously created by Ms. Mundt. Students will use the markers and chart paper to create a map of North Carolina. They will design the map so that at in each section like the Piedmont or Mountains the Ozobot will follow a code and spin or rapidly flash its lights. Fourth grade students will need to create their path so the Ozobot turns at the appropriate times and makes its way from one section of the map to the next.",My students need an Ozobot dual pack with markers and unruled chart paper.,"Applied Learning, History & Civics",Grades 3-5,Technology,216.18,Fully Funded

Close to 70% of my students live below the Federal Poverty Level. When my 1st grade students walk into my classroom I strive to provide for them an inviting, caring, and exciting learning experience. With so many personalities and such diverse home lives it can be difficult to make the transition to a learning environment. Yet once they are comfortable, they can work at something that seemed so difficult to them at first and then it happens...they get it! Now they are motivated to work hard and learn more. There is nothing more rewarding than the look of accomplishment on a 1st grade child's face. Each day after coming into the classroom my students put their belongings in their cubbies, have breakfast, and complete a morning warm up activity. After the activity is completed they are able to work with a Morning Tub. Morning Tubs allow students to work together while learning. My students need to learn how to interact with each other...many are very good at individual activities, but they need to learn how to share materials and ideas. Morning Tubs are a big part of this process. Each tub has materials inside that promote student socialization, collaboration, and creative learning. Morning Tubs offer a play-based opportunity for students to explore, create, and communicate. My class is divided into four groups (red, yellow, green, and blue), the morning tubs have a color code on the front. Each week I switch out the tubs so everyone gets a turn at each activity. The materials I requested will enhance student learning and build social skills as they work together on different activities. Rory’s Story Cubes have pictures with different themes like verbs, ways to move, places to visit. The students will roll 2-3 of the cubes and using the pictures along with their imagination they will combine them into a story. The Magna-Tiles are sized just right for little hands and easy to use to create a design on a flat surface or building in 3-D. Magna-Tiles develops patterning, shape recognition, building, and motor skills. The WonderFoam Dominos will be used for number tile matching games, sorting, counting, addition, and subtraction practice. I think the AGARE Brain Flakes will be a favorite. This is a set of interlocking snowflake shaped plastic disks. Students can build and learn. My students are excited about starting their day with these activities.

In our classroom, we have 23 students who weave a colorful fabric of different languages, racial and economic diversity, as well as athletic and artistic talents. My students bring to the classroom a wealth of cultural, linguistic, racial, religious, socioeconomic and academic differences. It is therefor important for these students to not only be able to identify with characters in the books they are reading but expose themselves to the differences in others.

Most citizens can describe the traditional 'American Dream' as the right and ability to carve out any life you choose. Unfortunately, for children, not all opportunities are equal. My students are the picture of America. They come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and vastly varied, socioeconomic lifestyles. Each child comes with their own life experiences, strengths, and weaknesses. They all want to feel safe and successful, and every one of them brings the need and desire to be loved. My students are curious, humorous, and zealous. They enjoy learning with their eyes, ears, and hands. As a classroom family, students work together, learn from each other, and strive for personal goals of personal best. Often times, students believe that reading is restricted to books. This can be overwhelming for students who lack confidence. This project will bring a bit of liberty to the classroom. Reading is reading. Building literacy requires more than an accomplished list of book titles. When time, stamina, or even interest is limited, many students simply choose not to read. My hope is that adding a fresh supply of kid friendly magazines will remove some of that pressure. Perhaps a novel full of chapters seems too daunting. Start with an article! Maybe sports heroes are more motivational that fantasy characters! So they can read Sports Illustrated Kids. Why not start your animal research with some fun facts from a sidebar in Zoobooks?

The reason DCS is so small is because we are, in essence, a modern-day, one-room schoolhouse. Our students are taught every subject in mixed-grade classes. We find, with the right amount of differentiating the material for the older and younger students, the students mentor one another, find role models, observe what struggle and humility look like. Our students are on a constant search to nurture and satisfy their sense of intellectual curiosity. To them and their families, education is the first priority in life. Because of the economic hardships many of our families face, they understand the connection between receiving a high-quality education and achieving success in life. We consider our school's curriculum to be extremely rigorous, and our expectations of our students are high. Our school represents the rich ethnic and racial spectrum of the city of Newark. Our students and staff are African-American, Caribbean, Caucasian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern: Muslim, Protestant, Jewish and Catholic. There are students whose families have been in Newark for decades, and students whose families have just arrived here from abroad: all-in-all our school community represents over 30 countries from around the world.DCS kicks off the coming school year with a school-wide, interdisciplinary unit of study on our city: Newark, NJ. The title of the unit is 'Newark: Revolution, Rebellion and Rebirth'. One of the periods we will focus on in-depth is the Newark Riots of 1967, also known as the Newark Rebellion. I am seeking literature to teach in English Language Arts which will enrich the students' knowledge of that period in American history, specifically as it relates to the African-American's struggle for civil rights in the 1960s. The 'March' Trilogy is a perfect vehicle to teach my students one man's real-life account of social rebellion in the 1960s, written in a format to which they can relate easily. 'March' is a graphic novel, presented in three parts, the story of the life of Rep. John Lewis. The format of a graphic novel will gain critical buy-in from my students and give them an immediate feeling that the material is in an accessible format. The use of 'comic book' conventions, will naturally convey the urgency and drama of the events. I am positive that the combination of the powerful content of John Lewis' story and the inviting design of the graphic novel will give my students a vivid context through which to view what happened in Newark in July of 1967: how it could happen in America and why it had to happen.","My students need to study the 'March' trilogy, so they may analyze the trajectory of a life steeped in the social activism and racial turmoil of 1960s America.","History & Civics, Literacy & Language",Grades 6-8,Books,1017.21,Fully Funded

311969880beb909a1bfc9b722ddbf84a,'Block Heads',"I teach in an arts magnet school that has a diverse population of students including low, middle and upper middle class families. Because I teach Transitional Kindergarten, my students come to me from all over our school district and are given a chance to experience Core Curriculum through instruction in visual and performing arts, culinary arts, music, drama, movement, and dance. Their creative, original work is shared all over campus, and each trimester at 'Presentation Nights.' One of the most beautiful elements on our campus is the incorporation of special needs students into our arts programs. Even though my students start school as four-year-olds, they quickly become responsible caring students and are encouraged to be collaborative learners. I am proud of the way my students embrace their classmates with special needs and treat them with respect and dignity. My project, 'Block Heads' is fueled by my belief that, when given interesting resources, students are inspired to problem solve. The simplicity of building blocks provokes the imagination of children. In order to build what they imagine, students have to figure things out, work together, and fail until they succeed. I have watched my students use the few blocks we have to create skyscrapers, airports, race tracks, homes, castles, parking garages, ramps, towers, train stations, and even a zoo! Block building has been a powerful motivator for my bilingual students to learn to communicate with their peers, and it has allowed my special needs students to play successfully alongside their classmates. The most significant work the children do as they play, is learn to share ideas, and collaborate to complete their vision. Even students with limited vocabulary can communicate ideas, and participate in block play. My current wooden block collection is small, so only a small group of children can play with them. I would love to see many small groups using blocks to build toward a common goal. For example, if one group is building an airport, another group might build a parking garage or restaurant that would support the airport. Blocks can compliment any curriculum theme. I believe that vocabulary is a predictor of academic success. If a child can imagine it, build it, and talk about it, later that same child will be able to write about it, and share reasons for his or her own ideas and experiences. I love the statement, 'good writing is good thinking.' It is my belief, that by creating a classroom full of 'Block Heads', my students will think better, and in time, they will be able to write better, calculate better, reason better, and create better.

Little minds tend to learn better when they feel they have a choice in how they learn and where to sit. I have a class full of bright first graders who are already excited to read and learn. Our school is populated with the majority of students living below the poverty level, but that doesn't stop them from having high goals and expectations. I want to provide for them a friendly, colorful environment in which they can learn without being tied down to a desk! I began thinking about alternative seating as I sat in on the millionth teacher meeting. It started with me moving in my chair because I just could not get comfortable. Then I stood up. Then it was all I could think about. Then the light bulb went off as I said to myself,'If I am this uncomfortable sitting in a regular chair, my mind wandering, how in the world do my elementary school students feel?' This is when I knew I had to make a change. I have always been a teacher that did not care if students needed to move or fidget, as long as they did not disturb anyone else. By providing alternative seating arrangements, I hope to provide all of my students with the choice of a seat that will help them to better concentrate in the school setting and free them from the traditional 'sit and get' mentality that school can have. I am requesting Kids Stay and Play balance balls for each student that can be easily moved around the room and give students the ability to 'get the wiggles out'. Along with the balance balls, students will also have a choice of using wobble cushions on the floor or in a traditional chair, 2 larger 'balloon seats' and a class set of 'fidgets' that are used for kids that just need that something to do with their hands. My goal for this project is that with these choices for my kids, my students can effectively manage their 'need to wiggle' while still growing their minds!","My students need crates so I can make them seats to sit on, so they can wiggle around without being a distraction to the classroom learning.",Literacy & Language,Grades PreK-2,Supplies,188.69,Fully Funded

Many of them receive free and reduced breakfast and lunch at school. Despite these challenges that they face, my students come to school with positive attitudes, and are always excited to learn and grow. The students in my classroom are very curious, and love to read and learn new things. They are also very active, always moving around and have a hard time sitting still. From the minute they walk in the door of my classroom I focus on their potential and growth while they are with me. I may not be able to control their home lives, however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day. I hope to create a classroom that encourages creativity, and allows my students ample opportunities for exploration and meaningful learning. These flexible seating options will allow my students to work around the classroom in comfortable seating for their learning style. Each learner in my classroom has a different learning style. With the option of flexible seating options my students will be able to choose an option that works for their learning style. The students will be able to move the seats wherever they prefer in the room to get their work done. I already have clipboards for them to use while sitting in these seats, and have asked for lap trays for students who would prefer that option.

First graders are wiggly and inquisitive! I've taught first grade for the last three years and know that every group is very different. I am so excited to meet my new group of kiddos and to set up an exciting and welcoming classroom. Flexible seating is not only a trend in education, it provides life lessons in choice and problem solving. Tolerance us the ability or willingness to tolerate something, in particular the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with. Teachers and students alike practice tolerance each day when they make choices for both themselves and others. Flexible seating including bouncy bands and wiggle seats, and working with building materials are two examples of when students must tolerate each other and share. Students with choice have a sense of ownership and students who want to use the same materials must learn to problem solve and find compromise. Kayla Delzer, a pioneer in flexible seating says, 'I've found that some of the immediate benefits of flexible seating include burning more calories...increased motivation and engagement, creating a better oxygen flow to the brain, and improving core strength for over all posture.' If it's good for kids, it's good for classrooms. My project also includes some creative exploration items such as magnetic tiles and building blocks. So much of what we do in the classroom is academically focused that it is easy to forget that creativity and building challenges and exercises the brain in important ways as well. The best thing about items like these are that the kids just think they are playing but in reality they are solving problems and challenging themselves while also building crucial fine motor skills.",My students need wiggle seats and bouncy bands for choice seating and creative building materials such as magnetic tiles and Domino blocks.,"Math & Science, Special Needs",Grades PreK-2,Supplies,226.39,Fully Funded

Each day I look forward to their welcoming “Good Morning Mrs. Rodrick!” Our class is both ethnically and economically diverse with English Language Learners making up nearly half the class. My students range between five and six years old. Yet they instinctively treat one another with respect and courtesy. From the time they enter our classroom until the bell rings at 3:10 p.m. they are actively engaged in hands on, student centered learning activities that maintain their focus and broaden their academic horizons. Kindergarten is where the foundation of developing literacy skills takes place. My Kindergarten students need to learn the letters and sounds of the alphabet in order to begin decoding words. We work on letter recognition the first few months of school. Letter recognition is a key step in a student's ability to learn to read and write. Visuals and hands on activities help young students learn and master important skills they need to succeed in the classroom. Making sure students are engaged both during whole group and small group instruction is crucial in the learning process. I believe the supplies I am asking for will give the students a way to interact with the alphabet through hands on play. The all about letters pocket chart will be used during whole group instruction in order to reinforce the letters and sounds.

This coming year, I will be transitioning from a third grade classroom to a fifth grade classroom. My grade-level teammates and I are planning to implement a workshop model in reading and writing, to help our students develop positive relationships with books and the authors who create them. We are also looking for ways to develop a comprehensive math program that introduces fifth grade math concepts while continuing to develop foundational math skills.

Please join our journey through fifth grade!My students come from diverse educational and family backgrounds, and they are all working hard to learn English and live up to their families' hopes and dreams for their futures. Some of my students have been recently reclassified as fluent English speakers and are reading on grade level, while others are new to the country and have limited literacy skills, even in their first languages. I work to provide opportunities for individualized practice with language and literacy skills through adaptive websites and personalized learning goals. A strong sense of personal space within a community-based classroom is critical to student success. Fifth graders need to be able to keep their personal learning goals private.

My students are faced with several challenges both in and out of the classroom. Despite the many challenges they face, I look forward to meeting my students where there are and challenging them to rise up to their best learning potential. My students are creative, clever and very spontaneous. They like to move, they love interactive learning and love lots of positive attention. Many of them are being raised in single parent households and receive a free lunch based on their socioeconomic status. These things may prevent them from getting ahead early in life and may not provide them with the life experiences many of us see as 'typical'.

By doing this in a creative and positive way, I am hopeful to inspire even our earliest learner. One area my students struggle the most with is listening without distractions.

I'm requesting one large circle time carpet for my students as their current circle time carpet is severely stained and left with tape residue from years of use.

In my classroom, we practice listening and speaking daily using cooperative learning strategies. The addition of a nice clean rug would give my students a much needed boost of practice in the areas of listening and speaking as they will feel less distracted by stains and sticky tape residue and become more engaged in activities that promote their learning.

My school is an urban option school that parents can choose for their children. I have many students with special education needs including learning disabilities, Autism-Spectrum Disorder, Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD. These special needs can impact their ability to access the skills and concepts I am teaching. During our independent reading time each day, my students find spots around our classroom to read their books. Two or three kids get to be cozy in our classroom library, but the remaining children have to sit on the floor or at their tables. Bean bags and wobble cushions will allow more kids to have comfortable spots for reading. And when they feel comfortable, they will be more focused readers! In addition, when small groups meet with me for individualized instruction, they will no longer have to gather around me on the floor. Instead, they will have stools on which to sit.

The answer was obvious, and this has some pretty drastic consequences for our students, many of whom struggle when asked to read instructions on lab handouts. Students who struggle with reading, or are learning English, or who have learning disabilities often can't meaningfully interact with text. This creates a challenge during labs where students need to refer to written instructions.

As a teacher in the Ninth Grade Academy, many of my students are constantly being introduced to new ways of learning. Every teaching technique is purposed to not only teach common high school subject matter but is also designed to teach acceptable social and work ethic skills. Personalized and self-paced learning has become one of the new leading instructional methods at my school. Having individual headphones for each student will help promote this style of learning. Between the 'Wait, I didn't get that' and 'Hurry up so we can move on' from one student to another, teaching classes larger than 25 students using the traditional method of whole class direct instruction becomes very cumbersome. I want my classroom to be a space where each student can be comfortable learning at their own pace without feeling rushed or slowed by other students. Having a class set of headphones allows me to offer each student the tools they need to actively participate in the learning environment I am aiming to create. When I can offer each student a pair of headphones, I am also offering them a sense of control by allowing them to stop, pause, and rewind any part of the lesson for any reason. Creating Educreations video lessons personalizes the lesson and gives students control on how quickly or slowly they obtain the information I am presenting. Educreations videos eliminate students idly waiting around or completing 'busy work' while others are finishing assignments they have already completed. Video lessons eliminate those issues by allowing students to move through the course content at their own pace.

All of my students receive occupational therapy support to help with fine motor abilities and sensory needs. We also work often on learning how to calm down and relax when a student gets upset or overwhelmed by something at school. Many things that we work on throughout the day are things that others take for granted. The ability to express one's emotions and self-regulate are difficult skills to teach and often require additional materials that are not always available in a typical classroom. My students need more materials to help with their fine motor skills. Fine motor tasks, such as writing, can quickly get boring and exhausting. Having more creative ways to strengthen these skills will help students be excited to work on these tasks and make writing easier in the future. Magnetic shapes and letter beads can help with math concepts and spelling skills while strengthening the muscles needed for fine motor tasks such as writing and cutting. Scooper tongs and suction cups require a lot of strength to make them work and are less frustrating to practice with because they are fun! I am working hard to create a space that is calming and relaxing for students when they need a sensory break or materials to help self-regulate their emotions. Have a soft place to sit and calming items are the best way to teach students how to calm themselves down when they are overwhelmed or upset. A beanbag is a perfect place to plop in to when you're upset or overwhelmed-we do not have any other soft spots to sit! The timers are a great tool that the students can use on their own to determine how much time they can take in the break area without an adult having to start and monitor a digital timer (and it is calming to watch the sand fall!).

I have students that are genuinely interested in learning about the world and all that it entails. As the world progresses, my desire is to teach my students 21st Century skills so that they can thrive and be successful throughout their academic career. In the past, studies have shown an enormous lack of students graduating from college and entering into careers such as science, technology, engineering, art and music. However, in present time, STEAM jobs are in high demand. While these jobs are in high demand, the challenge is finding qualified candidates to fill the positions.I believe if I introduce the numerous facets of STEAM, students will be more knowledgeable about its details, what they entail, and prompt their curiosity. My students will use the Legos to invent structures that we have read about in various fiction and non-fiction books. Students will be given differentiated tasks to invent or create structures based on their own imagination. The STEM gadgets that I am requesting will be used for the same tasks as well. Finally, the beatbox will be used to teach about engineering and how it is used not only to govern electricity but also in the music and instruments that are heard on a daily basis. Students will be able to explore a small portion of music production using the beatbox. Having these materials will transform my classroom into an interactive space where learning is not just taking place, but children are having fun feeding their interests.

Our students come from predominantly single parent homes where survival, and not literacy, is paramount. We have a dedicated, highly professional faculty, yet 'extra' materials that enhance curriculum are not a priority. Most teachers write grants and/or spend their own funds in order to facilitate the basic needs of our children. Our children need to be exposed to authors who deal with issues such as: violence, prejudice, intolerance, and human differences. Current literacy research states, '...using authentic texts and giving children choices are powerful and necessary conditions in the development of thinking, learning, and autonomy.' We have super, awesome students at our school who deserve only the BEST!The New York Times #1 Bestseller, WONDER, by R.J.Palacio swept through middle schools lighting a fire of enlightenment. Kids everywhere became aware and tolerant of those with kids with unusual disabilities. WONDER provided an authentic hero who dealt with abuse and intolerance with phenomenal courage. But how did the other children deal with Augie's facial disfigurement? What is their perspective? How did Augie's teacher support him? The additional stories, AUGIE AND ME, THREE WONDER STORIES, will enhance WONDER, help children make connections across texts, and highlight acceptance of differences as opposed to bullying and ostracism. The stories enable children to connect literacy and personal experiences in a realistic manner that will support positive change in our lives. I want them to become proud of who they are, and the contributions that they will eventually make to improve their communities. After completing each novel, the students will create an art project that displays their understandings and interpretations of the novel.

I have as many special education students as gifted and talented students, and they are involved in a variety of school activities including chorus, step club, sports, and drama. Each student has unique interests and abilities to develop and share, so I want to give them all an opportunity to shine in front of their peers. One way I do that is by providing STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) learning centers that are developed and led by students. They are encouraged to share their findings and creations with one another, and to collaborate for better results. I'm also building a library book collection that allows each child to explore his or her interests while learning about the world beyond our town. I have some students reading on a first grade level, while others are already reading middle school novels. My funding has been severely cut the last two years, so I'm turning to Donor's Choose to provide the resources this diverse group of students needs and deserves. My students have embraced the maker movement in my library, and many of my makerspace centers incorporate interactive projects that emphasize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) concepts. We use math manipulatives, simple building materials, art supplies, and science kits to put theory into practice. Students have the opportunity and guidance to engage in active learning when they're with me each week, but what happens after they leave the library? Your support of this project will provide additional STEAM instructional books for our library collection so students can continue the hands-on learning at home.

On a daily basis, the students come up with tons of ideas for new projects to do, or a bunch of different ways to do the same 'ol tasks rather than doing things the 'normal' way. They use creativity to conquer and achieve greatness no matter what they encounter. Being in any urban setting, it can become easy to develop a narrow world view. In order to see the world through various perspectives, it is imperative to read stories whose authors see the world through different lenses. I am determined to expose my students to a world that is much more vast than their everyday experiences. A wide variety of literature will provide the students with new ways to resolve conflict, embrace diversity, and adapt a new perspective of the world around them. Tablets are the most effective tools to reach a large collection of authors, genres, and contexts for maximum literacy exposure. Tablets would open the door to learning stations using software such as iReady, Anet, and newsela which are scientifically proven to increase lexile levels. Digital books eliminates budgetary roadblocks and allows a greater quantity of selections at a fraction of the cost compared to a class set of textbooks for every student.

While AVID students are quite diverse in terms of their cultural backgrounds, all of these students share a common desire to reach their fullest potential. The AVID class helps them realize their potential through a support system that helps them to overcome obstacles. The AVID elective class takes students that are likely to fall into the achievement gap and gives them the tools that will help to catapult them into the successful futures they deserve. WICOR strategies provide the framework for the AVID curriculum. Each letter in this acronym comprises one of the tools we commit to teaching the AVID students. The 'O' in the WICOR acronym focuses on the need for organization in order to be successful at anything we aspire to.

When I started as the Special Education teacher this year I thought it may be fun to start a small book club to promote literacy school wide, what I did not anticipate was the amount of interest the Book Club would generated! The students who joined the Book Club have done so simply because they love to read, and I want to continue to help foster their love for reading and books!Unfortunately, to have a successful Book Club we need books! We need sets of books so that the students can partner and read in pairs. The students work diligently setting goals and reading!Reading is a transferable skill that is needed to make gains in all areas of life. Having students who are passionate about reading makes me, as an educator, excited to come to work each and everyday. Not having the funds to provide my students with the simplest resources needed, such as books, is difficult. By supplying students with books and encouraging them to continue to read, I hope that they will see that there are not limits when you truly put your mind to something. I hope to set an example for the students and encourage growth both in reading and socially!","My students need BOOKS, BOOKS, and more BOOKS!

Our school is a strong ally of our community and is heavily embedded in the community, working diligently to aggressively fight against our odds. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. When we get our students in 9th grade, the majority have not had an art class since they were very young. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school, my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to be extremely empathetic to others, and we pride ourselves on being heavily involved in our community! Many of my students also come from poverty stricken areas and households as we are about 89% free and reduced price lunches. We have been creating original puppets and performing puppet theater for the past 3 years with the help of our community, school and donors like you. This year, we would like to step up our quality of puppet making and set creation into a professional style theater company which allows our students to gain real world experience within theater and puppetry. Going from paper mache to silicone rubber and foam is one of the many ways we intend to bring our high school puppet theatre to the next level. The materials in our cart will help us design, sculpt, cast and create new and professional forms of puppets and costumes. They will also allow us to upgrade our quality of set design, construction and presentation.

Many of my students' parents are in the military. The skill level varies from extremely high to extremely low. I have an average of twenty-five students in each of my five classes. Most are highly motivated learners and are very interested in science. They love technology and embrace its integration in the classroom. Fostering a love of learning and training lifetime learners is the main goal in my class. They are our future leaders. This year there have been many changes in my classroom. Our science benchmarks have changed and the class use of technology has increased. We have a greater focus on physical science in the state standards, so my students need chemistry kits to create models to achieve a deeper understanding of these standards. We have become a Google classroom and we use the technology to the best of our ability. The addition of an iPad will allow my students to video and research when they need it, instead of just when we are scheduled to have the media cart. Students often struggle understanding the concept of molecular makeup and atomic structure. If students are able to build models of these difficult concepts they will gain a better understanding of these benchmarks. The chemistry kits will allow a hands-on approach that will greatly benefit kinesthetic learners and visual learners alike. Students learn by doing and these kits allow students to create molecular structures and atomic models. The added use of these kits has the ability to create a great cornerstone middle school and high school chemistry. Every year my students create science videos of the benchmarks they learn in seventh grade. The students will be able to use the iPad for these videos and they can video other science demonstrations. Students will be able to peer teach each other by videoing demonstrations and science labs. Students will also help out their classmates by videoing important classroom lessons for future reference. All of these videos can be added to our Google classroom to be used as learning aids. The added technology will also be used for research in the classroom.

I've had some success with posters, physical manipulatives, and other visual aids, but it hasn't been enough. Being able to project my daily lessons onto the front board would change my lessons dramatically. Differentiation is always a necessary challenge in a classroom. Being able to project math word problems on a board would not only serve visual learners, but would connect the class as we explore continually complex mathematical concepts.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow could not have put it more accurately. Music allows me to communicate with all students. It does not matter what language they speak, what culture they are from, if they have a disability, etc. Music speaks to all, and through music, I can speak to all. The Orff-Schulwerk approach (or Orff approach) is a philosophy of teaching music. It is designed around what kids do best: play. In an Orff classroom, children move, sing, dramatize, play instruments, and more. This developmental approach to teaching music encourages students to explore, collaborate, and express themselves through music. The Orff approach helps students find the joy in performing, without feeling judged by their classmates or their teacher. Everyone is treated as equals, even in regards to solos. This encourages the students to enjoy making music alone and in groups. In order for me to become a certified Orff teacher, I have to take a two week long course during the summer.

Students become the instructors during a 3-hour event of artistic expression. Students and staff work hard on a daily basis developing our skills as artists at our school. With this event, the students will be able to show/share with others (parents and siblings) what they work on at school during art class. What an amazing opportunity for this joint adventure to be shared. A piece of art that both students and families will have forever. A follow-up activity will be organized, and the bowls will be used during an ice cream social.

Students have many responsibilities at home that make life hard at times at school. One hundred percent of the students in our school receive free breakfast and lunch. This can sometimes be the only meals students eat. Our school is in a high poverty area and parents work very hard to make ends meet. Students struggle with anger issues and low self-esteem. This has a huge impact on how they learn in class. These issues also affect how students react to others. Many students continue to struggle and have no basic skills on how to cope with their problems. I am an educator at Tulsa Public Schools. I have been teaching for 12 years. My life is my job. I strive to be the best I can be and model this behavior for my students. This past summer I was excited to receive a grant from Donors Choose for yoga mats for an after-school yoga club.I have been working hard on my health and have really felt the advantages of taking yoga. I want to share this with students. So many studies have been done on behavior and how meditation in yoga benefits students. Teaching in a high-poverty school, I see how stress affects students. Having skills to deal with that stress will help so much. Teaching these skills correctly is very important. Breathe for Change is a 200-hour professional development for educators to become yoga instructors and learn how to implement strategies to teach students in school. I am very excited to be accepted for the summer of 2018 workshop. The program costs 2,895 dollars, but I was granted a 1,000 dollar scholarship and 1,200 funded project from Donors Choose. This leaves my balance at $695. Any donations go to Breathe for Change to pay for my tuition. I am traveling out of state to Los Angeles. I have family in California so that will help with lodging expenses. I will be at this workshop for one month. Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated!

Stability ball classroom chairs provide benefits ranging from quieter classrooms to more attentive students. When students sit on stability balls, both sides of their brains are engaged in keeping their bodies centered on the balls. And when the brain is stimulated, it's more focused on learning.

Most receive free/reduced-price lunch and breakfast. As a teacher in a low-income/high poverty school district, my students are faced with several challenges both in and out of the classroom. Despite the many challenges they face, I aim to provide my students with creative and meaningful learning experiences. My third grade class is currently using the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Units of Study. We are currently in our Informational Reading unit and need Narrative nonfiction books in our independent reading library to support students throughout this unit. The students need to have narrative nonfiction to read independently so that they can practice the skills that I teach them during our reading minilessons. I think that having these books on their levels available to them will not only get them excited about the unit, but it will give them the opportunity to transfer the skills and strategies independently.

Do you remember those integrated art lessons during math or history class? My students are from one of the poorest and most violent cities in the country. Every day they strive to broaden their horizons and reach for the stars. For many, school is the only safe haven they know. I work to teach them that there is a bigger world out there than the one they see every day, that they matter, and that they will always have a safe place to explore the world around them in our classroom. Camden is the poorest and one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. School is typically the only safe haven these kids know. Our schools, for a variety of reasons, lack the resources to provide these amazing kids with the education they deserve. You're giving them the opportunity to dream of a better future. These kids have never experienced the excitement of a prom. Their parents have never seen their kids' faces as they are preparing for this big moment in their young lives. This is something that takes place in every community across our country and last year because of the support of donors on Donors Choose, we were able to have our first Junior Prom. This year we want this class of juniors to experience the prom, too. That's why we need these items such as the drink dispensers, the fountain, the extension cord and mini signs to make junior prom a special night for these amazing kids. These kids just deserve a night where they can leave behind their stressful existences growing up in a place where their monsters are real and violence is commonplace. That's why I want to make this Junior Prom special. Last year was the first year we have had a Junior Prom at WWHS. This year I want to make the prom even better than before. We hold the Junior Prom in our gym due to financial issues. However, I want to truly transform the gym in such a way that the kids can't tell they are in the gym. We are raising money to purchase a prom theme set and other decor. Anything you can give would be great. All the items listed are to decorate the prom and make it a night to remember for these kids.","My students need drink dispensers, drink fountain, extension cords and mini signs for their Junior Prom.",Applied Learning,Grades 9-12,Classroom Basics,238.89,Fully Funded

Despite so many hardships, my students are eager to learn and be successful. Please help us be successful by enabling us to get some necessary classroom supplies!The headphones will allow for my students to use their iPads with sound without disturbing others. This is hard when working with the teacher in small groups, some on iPads, some playing games, and some reading quietly. We also use the iPads for math apps throughout the year. Many of the skills are taught in video format, so the need for headphones is immediate! Anything in a game format, gives them immediate motivation! These materials will also allow them to practice their reading skills in a game format when they are working around the classroom in small groups! These board games will get a lot of use! The chart paper, markers, expo markers, and other classroom supplies are for the students and me to be able to make anchor charts to hang around the room for the students to use as resources throughout each unit for each subject.

As a Reading Interventionist and the school’s librarian, I’ve seen all of our students embrace a whatever-it-takes attitude to ensure their personal literary growth. Our students are hard-working, determined individuals with a desire to attend college; many would be the first to do so in their family. Our goal as a school is to provide rigorous curriculum, build meaningful student relationships, and provide experiences outside of the classroom as we prepare them for college and beyond. My students don't yet believe they can fall in love with reading, but I am out to prove them wrong! In my reading intervention class, students are anywhere between 1 - 3 grade levels behind in reading, and also struggle with their academic self-confidence knowing they are not as successful in this area. With this video equipment, students will be given a fun, interactive platform that excites them after finishing a short story, a poem, or a full novel. Students will have an opportunity to vlog about their thoughts from the reading material they dive in, summarize the text, or make connections to previous reads. These vlogs are alternative means to current homework that involves writing book reports. Ultimately, this equipment will also be used to start a vlogging club, piloted by my students and supervised by myself as our school's librarian.

In addition to classroom instruction, students are provided with a variety of specialties in physical education, visual arts, technology, and music. As the music teacher, I have witnessed a natural passion and enthusiasm, in all of our students, for creating music. They are always ready and eager to fully engage themselves in daily music education. With your help, we can enhance their music education to help them achieve their personal musical goals and dreams!It is well known that music is extremely beneficial to childhood development. Learning to play an instrument, such as the ukulele, provides students with many benefits, which are applied inside and outside of the music classroom. When students learn to play the ukulele, fine motor and coordination skills are developed as students learn strumming and chord patterns. Students develop and build their listening skills as they tune their own instruments and learn to play a variety of songs. When playing in an ensemble, students work collaboratively and collectively, improving their social and emotional skills on a daily basis. In the music classroom, students will compose their own songs, which provides students multiple opportunities for creativity and risk-taking. In my years teaching music, I have seen how music education, in which students sing and play instruments, provides an outlet for creativity and individuality. I have seen my students grow out of shyness and self-doubt, and have seen them blossom into strong, self-aware, performing artists.

The students' enthusiasm for school and life is so infectious and makes teaching them a joyful experience. Even after our 1st day of school was pushed backed 2 weeks to due Hurricane Harvey, students came to school each day with huge smiles on their faces and ready to learn. Our school is a Title 1 school, meaning our school has high numbers of children from low-income families.

While our classroom does have many barred instruments, we are lacking drums. Due to not having enough drums, physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited. My students learn best through singing, movement, speech, creating and performing on instruments so increasing the amount of instruments will increase student learning and understanding.I teach 600 students in grades K-5, and they come to me for 45 minutes once a week. My school is a Title I school in a military town. Military families many times will move away due to orders or deployments, but often return 1 to 3 years later.

Students learn through exploration and creating. Our classroom is lacking in drums, specially world drums to allow for students to explore, learn and create. Tubano drums are similar in tone to both an African Kpanlogo drum and a Conga drum. All of which my students have not had access to playing. Having these drums would open up the ability to teach and for the students to learn about the music and culture of areas that have been missing from our classroom: Latin America and Africa. While three drums may seem insignificant, having these drums in our classroom will allow for a more authentic application of world music.

Our 1st grade students are eager and thoughtful learners- ready with the foundation they gained in kindergarten to fully launch into becoming readers, writers, mathematicians, and scientists. They have gracious hearts, resilient spirits, and limitless curiosities. We are lucky to be their 1st grade teachers. Our neighborhood is known to be one of the most diverse in the country and every classroom in our school reflects that gift. In addition to the richness that such diversity brings, we also recognize that different opportunities and experiences in early childhood can create inequitable beginnings for children in school. As a school community, we know without a doubt that all of our students are highly capable and work with determination to ensure that every student has the resources, instruction, and support necessary to achieve success. First grade is a time of tremendous growth for students. They launch from the building blocks of kindergarten to delve further into more complex thinking. In reading, they move from working with the alphabet and decoding words to making meaning of texts by making connections, comparing and contrasting characters, making inferences, and more. In math, they move from working on counting and using models like fingers and drawings to add and subtract to using a variety of strategies to mentally solve problems with greater and greater quantities. This rigorous work demands fluency both in reading words and in math facts. Our first grade classes use various computer programs to help our students develop this fluency. Of the 12 computers that are shared among our 3 first grade classrooms, half don't have usable headphones. Many of the headphones are low-quality- with only one side still emitting sound. Others are missing the foam cushioning or are even taped together. The remaining are adult-sized, so go past the ears of our first graders and frequently slip off of their heads. The 10 headphones donated from this project will replace our old, broken, ill-fitted pairs so that students can productively engage in their learning without being interrupted with headphone issues.

We are in a low-income urban school district. Our elementary school includes pre-k through third grade classes, with several self-contained special education classrooms. My class is a community of learners who have numerous strengths but also have learning challenges. The students work hard every day to improve their skills and show growth. They are energetic, fun, happy, and eager to learn. Each day is an adventure, and my students will always be my 'kids' long after they leave my classroom! My students need a new computer and color printer in our classroom to enhance their learning and provide additional opportunities to use technology. In addition to using educational websites to reinforce skills, the computer will also be used to view videos to supplement my lessons. My students will benefit from a brand new computer and color printer, and they will be motivated to use the computer as a learning tool. In addition, the current computers in my classroom are older and do not function as quickly or effectively. A computer upgrade is really needed! The earbuds are needed to replace headphones that do not work properly. Each student will get their own set of earbuds to use at the computer.

Their parents don't speak English which makes it difficult to communicate with them or have home support. The students receive free breakfast and lunch. I have students who live in shelters and others that come from broken homes. They have seen more things than I could have imagined at their age. I realize that no matter what their lives are like at home, my students always feel safe at school. They are eager to learn but lack the supplies that would further enhance their learning. I am very passionate about my job. I would like to provide more for my students; however, we have limited supplies. I purchase many supplies out of my own pocket, but this becomes expensive. Most of my students come to school improperly dressed for the weather or without needed school supplies. It would be great to have some assistance for my classroom to give the students a better education. These Chromebooks will enable my students to use technology to enhance their learning. They need to be familiar with 21st century skills. We will be using the Chromebooks on a daily basis for both math and reading skills. We use softschools.com, starfall.com and razkids.com as well as youtube video to help us learn key materials to help us learn the necessary information to grow. My students will be able to access educational websites that will help them become better readers, mathematicians, and scientists. Being in a high poverty school district with a large number of ESL and ELL students, many of them do not have access to technology outside of school.I want to create challenging and fun learning experiences to build on their skills. As a teacher in a low income, high poverty area many of my students are faced with multiple challenges both inside and outside the classroom. Technology is a great way to foster learning goals at a higher level. It allows them access to technology which they do not all have access to in their homes. Many families are just making ends meet and having a computer at home is not a priority. However, my students need to learn technology skills to help them thrive in the learning environment as well as give them the knowledge to do state-mandated tests on the computers at school.

My kindergartners are fortunate to have access to a beautiful school library, a rich and diverse classroom library and some tablets in the classroom to listen to stories. Dr. Seuss said, 'The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” In their short time in 5K, they have learned that books allow them to to discover things they never knew and to experience amazing adventures.

Debra KostrewaRaymond School 5K TeacherHaving my students read their little reader books to their families every week is the cornerstone of our school’s homework program.

Many of my students have never left the county, let alone the country. With that being said, it is my goal to give them as much exposure as I can to the world around them. Dinosaurs are a huge topic that the children love. They are big and mysterious and seem to spark so much creativity among our little ones. Children have a natural curiosity that surround the topic, and these materials will allow my children to satisfy that inquisitiveness. The dinosaur figurines can be used for multiple lessons within our classroom that will allow them to make connections from what they see and hear in the books to their world.

Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students speak English fluently, and some do not. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives. My students love Daily 3! Daily 3 rotations include Math Writing, Math by Myself, and Math with Someone. During Math with Someone, students have the opportunity to play math games that review the skills that have been previously taught and they have practiced at Math by Myself, and Math Writing.

In this Leadership Class we are learning about very real global issues and the students are creating possible solutions to problems they are passionate about. We use all kinds of engaging resources like videos, music, and interactive experiences to keep the classroom engaging and connected to the world. My students are 21st century learners who are constantly seeking knowledge and they recognize the value of technology and books to gain valuable information. The students are growing up in a fast paced informational world, and we are learning how to ask the right questions, access relevant and meaningful information, and then use that information to become great citizens. Classroom resources can be expensive so students often have to share which limits the amount of learning they can explore on their own.A Strong library is the foundation of a great classroom. Books are the perfect way to introduce a topic, enhance an idea, provide research resources, and answer questions. The picture books will help introduce important topics of character development, empathy, grit, creativity, and compassion. All the workbooks will give us lots of examples of how to improve skills and the activities and game books will let us practice. The team building and leadership activities are an invaluable way for students to practice team work, communication, leadership, creativity, and resilience. When Hurricane Harvey came through Harris County and hit Humble ISD my apartment, with a large chunk of my classroom library, was flooded.

Diversity is important everywhere and maybe moreso in the library. My students come from diverse backgrounds. The books in our school library should also be examples of diversity. Students like to read about things that they find familiar. A character in a book, that is experiencing a problem similar to one they might be experiencing, may make them feel less alone. It also might suggest an answer to their personal problem. I have seen kids' eyes light up when they see a book with a character that may look like them.

Paula Phillips is the founder of the extraordinary nonprofit Right Road Kids. She is also award-winning radio show host, children's author, and motivational speaker for children and educators. A year ago, I had the opportunity to have her do a wonderful Skype session on self-esteem and kindness with my classroom. From that presentation, I was inspired and able to build on the strong lesson, continuing to teach my students about the joy of random acts of kindness and making the world a better place. This message and lesson is crucial in our children's lives. Now, every month, I have my students take part in kindness events and projects that are life-changing for them AND those they help. This Skype session would again bring Paula and the extraordinary Right Road program into our classroom this school year, all the way from California! In addition to the vital kindness lesson, I want my students to know that THEY ARE SPECIAL. Through this session, Paula would help children come to understand that out of all the people in the whole world, there is only ONE of them. I focus on the importance of relationship-building with my students every day. I let them know that they are each a unique, special person, but hearing it from another adult in the uplifting way that Paula is able to convey is exactly what they need. In addition, Paula would provide follow up in terms of needed school supplies for our classroom even after the Skype session is over. And the corresponding Right Road class pack would also allow us to continue our journey through knowing that we are special, believing in ourselves, and living in kindness.

We need alternatives to store our workshop materials and places to store collective materials to share per workstation, so with storage bins and baskets, students won't have distractions inside their desks to play with. We need options for seating in groups or individually for quiet work time, so with a variety of table tops, students can choose how and where they want to work for the day. We also need alternative seats to make grouping around alternative tables easier to create, so with stools students can move around easily and create work groups efficiently. And lastly, with exercise pedals and a wobble chair, kids balance movement with stationary learning.

My students and I love to dive deep into learning about historical figures and symbols. I have quite a few books about historical figures but have very few books on American symbols. The books I am requesting would allow us to study in depth about the various American Symbols. I feel it is important for my students to know about these symbols and why they are important to the United States. I am also requesting books about teaching kindness to everyone even if they are different. I feel it is important to teach children about empathy at a young age and learn how to handle different situations. I focus on teaching my children about how to be a leader and show kindness to all.

I work with students who are labeled in many ways: ELL, LD, ID, BIP, IEP, SLP, apraxic, autistic, ADD, ADHD, ODD, and the list goes on. I'm working to help students remove their labels and find their feet, as well as their voices. My students come from a variety of backgrounds, but one thing they have in common is their thirst for creative learning opportunities. My students are studying insects and arthropods. We need lab coats and scrubs to feel profession and get into the role of productive scientists- and to protect our uniforms of course.

The community supports its schools despite the fact that its residents are low socio-economic population. Due to decreasing enrollment at the school, the school is in financial distress. Our school parents, like all parents, want what's best for the education of their children. They give as much as they can to fund supplies and consumables that go to the classrooms. However, the financial problems of the school have negatively impacted every classroom. Our student-teacher ratio is extremely high and students are often crammed into classrooms that are too small to allow them much room to comfortably work. I actively look for ways to facilitate teaching and learning, allowing my students to move and collaborate while learning in a rich and welcoming environment. I have flexible seating options and desks that can be easily arranged for a variety of tasks. I want the students in my class to be excited to enter the room each and every day. Each and every one of my students is priceless to me and so is their education. Swivl camera tracks the speaker, whether that be a teacher, an individual, or a group of students. It will record individual or group presentations. Student collaboration and presentation skills will be enhanced through the frequent use of this device.

cd2ee13e9467dacbc50fcc26916788e2,Music Teacher Goes to School!,"My school is a creative arts school! As a part of my music classroom, we spend a lot of time working on music literacy through the Orff Schulwerk Method using barred instruments like xylophones. I love seeing students eyes light up when they finally are able to read music and play music on their own! Music is such a part of all of our lives and I love that I get to help students experience it through these lively and fun lessons. I don't have kids of my own so my students are my babies! They come to school every day and are so enthusiastic about learning new music and playing fun songs. I am grateful I get to spend my days doing life with these kiddos. Work is not work when you love what you do!“Since the beginning of time, children have not liked to study. They would much rather play, and if you have their interests at heart, you will let them learn while they play; they will find that what they have mastered is child’s play.” – Carl Orff The Orff approach teaches children through experiences in music, speech, and movement. Feelings precede theoretical knowledge. Students develop understandings from discovery. Their early music education often begins with experiencing rhythm through childhood chants and children’s’ rhymes. Children go on to explore music and movement in ways similar to “real life” musicians and dancers. Learning is structured so success is immediate. For example, children might play a steady beat drone on barred instruments to accompany a pentatonic song. These first harmonies echo the traditional instrument drones that historically have accompanied folk songs and tunes from nearly all cultures around the world. While very simple or elemental, these accompaniments are effective. As children accompany a song, improvise a melody, create a dance or work with musical forms, they are engaged in real-life tasks. Through joyful music making, movement and words children learn through child’s play. This professional development will increase my knowledge in this teaching method. It will allow me the skills to implement it in my Magnet Creative Arts School. I believe the students will benefit just as the founder stated, learning through singing, saying, dancing, and playing. The funding you provide will cover the cost of my course fee, food, transportation, and materials for this 10 day course.","I need funding for my coursework in the Orff Schulwerk Level 1 class.

These six and seven year olds are learning to read, have become writers and have made big gains in math. We are busy all day long, and there's still much to do. My students are in first grade, and love coming to school to learn!They come from a wide variety of living situations. Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students speak English fluently, and some do not. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives. My students have read about butterflies this year, and have seen videos about the butterfly life cycle. Now that they have the basic understanding of this life cycle, I want to give them a hands-on experience, learning about these real insects from their own observations. Watching and recording what these real insects are doing will cement the knowledge that my students have learned this year about butterflies. They will have the opportunity to actually see the caterpillars move and eat, build their chrysalis, and hatch as butterflies. These butterflies would start as caterpillars in the Insect Lore Live Caterpillar kit. Without this project, my students would not have this opportunity to carefully observe these live insects. Within this project that will take several weeks to complete, I have created a STEM lesson where my students will be presented with the problem of creating a balloon butterfly that will really fly using baking soda, vinegar and a 2 liter bottle. They will also design a butterfly habitat with a plastic butterfly counter, and a butterfly craft project that will recycle used crayons. The Elmer's 1680 crayon sharpener will be used to make crayon shavings for the craft butterfly activity. The books in this project including, Ultimate Bugopedia, My-Oh My-A Butterfly, National Geographic Caterpillar to Butterfly, as well as other books, will offer real information about caterpillars and other insects, that the students can record in their science journals as they make connections. The Hungry Caterpillar book and the Life Cycle sequencing kit will be used as an attention grabber and wrap up to the project. I know my students will learn so much from project because they will be observing live insects and have a hands-on experience that they cannot get in their daily lives outside of school.

The school is a bit spread out and differing building styles but it seems to match the culturally diverse student body of the school. In addition to the cultural diversity over 68% are socioeconomically disadvantaged, over 38% are English language learners, and over 70% of them receives free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch. Despite the hardships that they face, they come to school ready to work hard and eager to learn. My hard working students love to learn through play. My goal is to provide learning materials that are fun and benefit all students. They enjoy working together with classmates, discussing choices and evaluating their next steps. This is the most effective way for them to learn. It is so exciting to watch them learn together and support each other. These students are also incredibly kind, creative, thoughtful, and open to new experiences, everything a little mind should be. They are the most amazing children. They work hard each day to live 'The Maple Way,' which means being kind, safe, and responsible.I have chosen a laminator and laminating supplies to allow me to create activities, word and number cards that will give longevity to these learning materials. My students love to play games and make words or patterns and they learn best this way. I will now be able to make high quality, colorful and fun games and cards that will last for many students to use them for many years.

Most of my class is made up of students that are labeled as 'migrant.' This means that they travel with their families as the crops change throughout the season. These students are always moving and normally spend their afternoons working with their parents and doing their homework alone because their parents do not speak any English. The other half of my students come from broken homes and currently live with one parent who tries their best to juggle life’s responsibilities. My students are overcomers and they WANT to learn. Currently, everyone in our county has free lunch and breakfast due to the overwhelming poverty rates and we receive government-funded snacks as well. Despite the odds, all of my students come to class every day with the determination to beat the cards that they have been dealt. When I work, I want to be comfortable and sometimes it is not at a desk. The same goes for the students that are in my classroom. This Flex-Space floor collaboration bundle will provide the students with a different option than a normal desk. Many students also have attention problems, being able to move and change seating can eliminate the behavior issues that may arise. The Flex-Space bundle will allow students to get on the floor comfortably together as they are collaborating in all subject areas. Students spend MOST of their school day in the classroom so their seating options need to fit their sensory needs. That may be having a chair that allows them to move, a classroom that they can collaborate, and even a spot where they can work in peace. These students are learning that a classroom is not just within the four walls of a classroom. It doesn't have to be a place that is orderly and uncomfortable.

My students are excited and love the opportunity to explore the world around them. They have been learning to work collaboratively and how to find solutions to real-world problems. This project is to teach my students about the importance of taking care of the Earth. In our classroom, we do all we can to help the environment including recycling and reusing. My students always look at things before they put them in the trash and ask if we really need to throw them away. They are the future and if they are empowered to take care of Earth, they will share their knowledge with others. There are three parts to this project that will enhance my student's learning of the importance of being responsible. They might be little, but they have great power. The first part is to help stock our Creation Station area in our classroom. In the Creation Station, students create projects out of materials that would have been thrown away. Currently, students sit in the floor, but wobble stools will allow them to have a place to sit as they reuse materials. We have a bits box where we place all leftover paper from any cutting projects we do in class as well as old magazines and newspapers. The second part of this project is to help us go green with classroom participation with LCD writing tablets. These tablets run off one battery for 5 or more years and can be used over and over by students. Students can use them instead of whiteboard and whiteboard markers. Whiteboard markers have to be thrown away after we use them.
