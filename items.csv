These DNA models help overcome that obstacle. I work at a high needs school in an inner city in Missouri. Our school caters to children whose families are seeking asylum from religious or political persecution in their homeland. I work primarily with English Language Learners and the use of visuals are imperative to teaching them not only science, but English as well. DNA is a type of macromolecule known as a nucleic acid. It is shaped like a twisted double helix and is composed of long strands of alternating sugars and phosphate groups, as well as nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine). DNA controls cellular activity by coding for the production of enzymes and proteins. The information in DNA is not directly converted into proteins, but must first be copied into RNA in a process called transcription. These models allow students to break down complex processes into steps as well as engage the learners through a hands-on approach to science education. Constructing DNA models is a great way to learn about DNA structure, function, and replication. DNA models are representations of the structure of DNA.

Three calculators available for students to check out to complete their homework and prepare for the SAT will help out immeasurably! My students are some of the hardest working in San Diego. They have aspirations to attend college and higher level math classes will help them achieve this goal. Please help my students get calculators to use in their math classes. In our school, our students are: 40% immigrants and refugees, 63% English language learners, 100% eligible for free and reduced lunch, 100% hardworking, resilient, and diligent. The students are in one of the most diverse areas of the United States. Students come from Africa, Vietnam, Mexico, Burma, and many other countries. The students stand proud as new Americans and value the opportunity to get an education. Many of these students will be first in their family to attend college, the first to graduate high school, and they are taking Calculus! 120 students are prepared to take Calculus this year. Many of my students have had very little experience using technology, let alone graphing calculators. Imagine being confused in your math class, the teacher describes how it works, but you just can't imagine. Then you punch a few buttons on the calculator and, voila, everything makes sense. Calculators are essential for success in Calculus. Additionally, students will be gaining skills using the graphing calculators that will be important for success when taking the SAT. Calculus is impossible to understand without calculators. Access to this basic technology will dramatically improve success for these young people. Your support will create a new pathway for success for our students. A calculator can make a huge difference in learning.

The leveled readers we have are very short and most of my readers have already read them multiple times. Chapter books, please! My students are becoming excellent readers. I think that may be my favorite part of this job so far, watching them grow. At this point in the year they have shown so much growth! I cannot let them be held back by our selection of books. It is my job to challenge them, and make sure they have all of the necessary materials to do excellent things with their lives. Some of them have never read chapter books before and that accomplishment alone is something that they are proud of. I want them to excel, be proud of their accomplishments and become amazing readers. Please help me do this for them! The titles that I have requested are from some of my favorite book series from when I was a child. Of course, I added some suggestions from my little ones, but most of you will remember reading these books! The Magic School Bus, Henry and Mudge, Amelia Bedelia, these are just a few of the series that are included in this project. Reading can be fun, and it is especially fun when readers get to follow a character through multiple books. I want to share that fun with my students. My students have been so inspired by the donations that we have received so far from DonorsChoose.org. They even wanted to start their own 'giving tree' bulletin board to track the ways that our class can help others because we have been helped so much.

For those of us who have had the opportunity to go to college, it is clear to see the impact made by that experience. Too many of our students do not see themselves in college, and may never decide to try if they are not exposed to a college campus now. My students live in urban Los Angeles. The majority of my students come from low income families. They rarely get opportunities such as this one, to be able to visit a college campus, and to see a live collegiate sporting event. Our students may not even realize that at many colleges, extracurricular activities, such as sporting events can be such a large part of the college experience. We are requesting one bus for 6 hours in order to transport our students to the UCLA 'I'm Going to College' event. We have already secured 50 donated tickets for our students to attend the UCLA Track and Field meet, as well as the college fair and campus tour activities hosted by UCLA during the event. We would like to offer this trip to our students as a reward for their excellent attendance all year. We have held excellent attendance as a major goal for our students this year. Attendance in school is the most important factor that will determine whether students will pass their classes this year, and eventually graduate from High School.

I teach robotics and physics at an all-girl public school with a focus on science. Many students have no concept of careers in science and this is a great way to open their eyes to engineering in an exciting hands-on manner. Students will learn to program small robots using the netbook. This class is a pre-engineering class for young ladies that have some interest in technology. College requirements for technical fields, such as: 'experience in computer programming', and others, are met by taking this class, and using the technology you are helping make available. The robot kits are already in the classroom. We now need the technology (netbook) to use the software, learn and write programs, and communicate with the robots. The students will be tasked with using sensors on their robots, and programming the robots to go through a maze, autonomously, using these sensors. The classroom is divided in eight teams. Students will gain excellent preparation for engineering careers and information technology. This is a great means to boost students' confidence about their success in technical fields.

All year, we have studied the benefits of attending college and the process of getting in. But nothing inspires students like seeing actual colleges in person. If we receive the funding we need, I will take my students on a college trip to Washington, D.C, where we'll visit five colleges representing a wide array of possible experiences (public vs. private, large vs. small, urban vs. suburban vs. rural, etc.). We will spend an entire day at each college - we'll attend an information session, take a campus tour, and visit cultural centers so that my students meet and relate to real college students. My students will have researched each college in advance and prepared a full packet of questions, and they'll take notes throughout the day to ensure that they will fully retain what they learn. During the evenings, we will visit historical and governmental landmarks so that my students can be fully immersed in this amazing city.

I work at a Title 1 School where 70% of our students are free and reduced lunch. They are enthusiastic learners who need the basic fundamentals to succeed in Kindergarten and enrich their love of school. My students are ready for new challenges and enjoy learning. Most of my students have not had the opportunity to work with math manipulative's or played games that facilitate learning. My students come into the school year with little knowledge of what math is, how we use it everyday, and basic number sense. It is my job to get my kindergarten students loving school, so they continue on their path to a higher education. Math can be very frustrating to young students and it is my goal to find games, tools, and resources to encourage students to love math! The resources I have chosen are hands-on, interactive, and promote basic problem solving skills. The use of mathematical stations help each student independently problem solve, work with others to explain their mathematical thinking, and engage the students in game-like centers that promote learning. Puzzles not only promote logical and mathematical reasoning, but also fine motor skills. The writing tablets will help the students write numerals and explain their thinking while developing number formation. The various learning centers will help the students build confidence in explaining their thinking with peers in small groups, and have them show their mathematical knowledge. Students gain information through hands-on learning centers because they are physically manipulating the tools to help them problem solve. Another great advantage is teaching the students how to explain their thinking using math language and build their own oral language among their peers. My students are extremely enthusiastic about math, but it can become frustrating to work through mathematical problems. I need the resources and manipulative's to help my students strengthen their confidence in basic problem solving, explain their thinking, and build their math language. Throughout their education, children must explain their reasoning, and these resources will help students to naturally progress in explaining how they found a solution and how math is important to everyday life!

My classroom is a Tittle 1, Head Start Preschool/Pre-K mixed aged classroom. They started as a rambunctious group excited to do anything in school and have grown into deeper learners these last few months. Now that their love for school and learning is growing, I know I need to set them up for success, especially with their pre-literacy and mathematics skills. Finding a way to foster their excitement for learning as well as their social/emotional growth in a play-based environment is my main job! We have so many children wanting an adult to read books to them, it has become challenging to meet all of the student's needs during this critical learning time. With no listening center currently, the children are frustrated when they cannot read the stories on their own. By giving them a way to listen to books in a more independent way, we can allow each child to grow their love for reading. In addition, children will develop their listening skills, their abilities to follow directions (page turning signals), and their social skills by reading with a friend! Looking at the data for the student population in our area is one of the most disheartening things I can do. But it is also the best reminder of why I am doing what I do each day; setting up my students for the best possible educational future!

Every day I am constantly amazed by their resiliency to obstacles and the extremes they will go to in order to succeed. I know they are on pace to great things. The most heartbreaking part of teaching has come the Monday after ACT Test Saturdays. My students come back and tell me about all the problems they knew how to perform and yet could not because they didn't have the calculators the problems required. Their scores are lower not because they don't know as much as other students but simply because they do not have the resources other students do. Too many of my students have been admitted to fine universities with their admission deferred unless they can get their ACT scores higher. My students have lowered the barrier between themselves and their dreams. Help them make the final jump. Donations to this cause will be used to buy calculators to be used on the ACT.

My students live in a small town. They are wonderful kids that are always full of energy. They always keep me on my toes and I love it. Our school is the newest building in the district, but despite the new walls and floors, we have some very dated reading materials. One of the copyrights on my text books is 1991. Because of the dated images, students often think there is nothing 'good' to be found in the text book which sends me on a quest for newer material to keep their interest levels up. These books that I've requested will help to teach a variety of literary elements in a non-threatening way. Most of the stories are historical fiction which allows me to pair a non-fiction text with the historical fiction story. The idea is to get text-to-text connections between the historical and non-fiction. As a result of high-stakes testing, students have been taught very little History and Science in the past several years. It's a disservice to our students. I hope to remedy at least part of that while incorporating my own subject area (ELA).

This station will include a CD player, set of headphones, junction box and a storage unit to keep things organized (we already have sets of books with corresponding CDs). This listening center will ensure that all 20 students will have access to individual reading instruction, which is critical as they embark on the initial stage of the multi-year process of becoming fluent readers. Exposure to fluent reading on an individual or group basis during morning reading, center time, or free choice will help students gain access to books, recognize letters, make letter-sound connections, recognize site words and aid in comprehension. Furthermore, this will instill my students with a sense of confidence that they are reading the book along with the recorded reader. Additionally, the listening center will foster productive interaction with technology and further develop their fine motor skills. A listening center will be a wonderful addition to the classroom.

Bamboo Pen Tablets will allow my students to produce drawings and diagrams of their ideas digitally then display them on their ePortfolio websites. These devices will be used to construct sketches and plans in our STEM Engineering class. Fewer students in the United States are pursuing careers in engineering. This concerns me because engineers are the designers and innovators in our society. If we want to strengthen our economy we need to invest in our future and inspire students toward careers in engineering design. The new common core Next Generation Science Standards emphasize engineering and design thinking. This is an important shift in education from standardized teaching toward problem based learning. In response, I have created an engineering class which focuses on design thinking and problem solving. It is very exciting for our school, which is in Central California. We are a low income community and many students are disadvantaged financially. Many of my students have never been out of the city. They do not have many opportunities. This year has been the hardest for us. Our district is facing big budget cuts. Our spending has been frozen and reduced, which is why I am seeking funding outside of the school. The new Common Core is inspiring a shift from a focus on 'correct answers' to developing student ideas. Students come to the classroom with an entire belief system in their heads. It's important for teachers to find out what students think, uncover any misconceptions in that thinking, then challenge those misconceptions with activities and projects. An important piece in this strategy is to ask students to create explanations of their thinking. One way students do this is by drawing diagrams and writing about how systems like the carbon cycle work. With Bamboo tablets, students will be able to draw these diagrams on the computer and post them to their ePortfolio websites. Posting their work publicly on the web gives students more accountability for their learning. Also, students will use these devices to do art and 3D CAD design. This will allow us to move away from using paper which is more earth-friendly. And student work will be online for parents and the public to view! Newspapers tell us we have many high tech jobs available in the US but we don't have the skilled employees to fill them. Students do not have the thinking and collaborative skills that industry wants. I've created an elective class to focus students on these skills.

They also allow students to add their own circuits, and write control programs for what they create. Our students are like the field in the picture, mature and ready to harvest...to add their minds to the storehouse of knowledge. But it takes special tools and effort to reap that harvest. We are a lower middle class school. For those of you who understand what it means, 51% of our students qualify for the free lunch program. In spite of this we are not in a low enough income bracket to get much special government funding. Many of my students are bright enough to attend college, but the reality is that many will need to get jobs to support themselves and their families as soon as they graduate. It takes a lot of vision and commitment for that type of student to put in the extra effort to add additional education or trade school to their after High School schedule. We work on vision casting. We try to instill a dream that stays with them and motivates them well after High School so they will make a brighter future for themselves. BoeBots are not toys. We have one of the Lego Mindstorms kits, and it has many great features, but the reason we use the BoeBot platform is that it uses industry standard parts and programming. Students learn Basic and C++, languages that translate into jobs after they leave us. I can introduce you to industry partners that use the Basic Stamp (the micro controller that powers the BoeBot), to design and build their real world products.

Our students are individuals who couldn't find public school supportive enough to fulfill their educational needs and wants. They are creative, talented, and each bring their own unique background experience to the table. For some, this school brings the only structure and positive social interaction they have in life. For others, it was an alternative from dropping out of school because of bad life choices, or the failure to reach the demanding requirements in order to graduate in the normal time span. Our school is set in a rural community and draws in students from the surrounding counties. This allows our students to interact with different peers, normally unknown if attended public schools in an environment were being 'different' is 'normal'. My goal is show these students not to limit themselves based on their expectations, but learn to reach beyond mine. The resources we are requesting are essential for us to build underwater ROVs. The STEM curriculum is integrated into our science classes, giving the students a more hands-on, meaningful experience. The students learn such things as buoyancy, underwater biology, wiring, design, and much more. The objective with each project is then to compete with other schools (private, public, and alternative) around the state to test our innovative designs and theories. Having the materials will help us reach more students who respond more to hands-on learning verses kill and drill traditional learning. By building these ROVs, students are learning more about careers in engineering, robotics, natural resources, wiring, and architectural design. This is our first year doing the underwater ROVs, and we hope to start a friendly rival with the IVD team at our school who have won awards for their electric car designs. The donations to this request will make such a huge positive difference, first, by showing our students that there are people in the world that do care about their education; second, by providing unique experiences at our school that the local public schools don't provide.

We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past four years, our small initiative has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. This calendar year, a small group of students will be traveling through Spain and Portugal. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the religious influences on art and literature, strengthen their Spanish speaking skills by volunteering with a community center, and compare the traditions, cultures, and cuisine to what they are accustomed to. They will be part of nightly conversations that ask them to reflect on the experience in the moment. Much of their experience will be captured in nightly journals that will be collected. These will assist with their research upon returning. In funding this grant, you give another student the opportunity to travel with us. The total cost covers everything for the student, including transportation, meals, and all activity costs. The research, experience, and life long lessons that are produced from these tours are true testaments to the value of this program.

Some things are too important to just wish for, which is why I am turning to Donors Choose to get these supplies. We are a rural school district in Central Washington. All three schools are on a single campus, with about four hundred students at the high school. A lot of the students' parents are field laborers with limited proficiency in English. Approximately 80% of our students are Mexican. The vast majority of the students appreciate the value of a good education and work to take advantage of what is being offered to them. With these kits, my students will be able to construct working motors. Reading about how motors work is a poor substitute for actually making a motor from start to finish and watching it spin. Without these kits, electric motors will be nothing other than a bunch of abstract vocabulary. With these motors kits, students will learn the fundamental principles behind a number of devices that are used on a regular basis, such as fans, blenders, and vacuum cleaners, just to name a few. They will learn how some wires and electricity can be used to make practical devices that we rely on every day. It's important for students to have engineering experiences as well as science experiences. I think that engineering is grossly neglected in secondary education. Yes, science is important and paves the way for many engineering advances, but pure science doesn't bring improvements into our lives--engineering does.

They are mixed in some classrooms which makes for a very diverse classroom body. I am requesting an LCD projector so all of my students can enjoy the luxury of being able to observe a PowerPoint presentation or a clip from a movie and even something as simple as a biological animation without 25 students huddled around a computer monitor. My project is so important because historically learning biology was difficult as students had to visualize so much of what was read in their own head. With so much information and visual aids available on the Internet today we can more thoroughly teach and reach more children than ever before.

STEM is a concept that is brewing in our county. These STEM kits will be able to jump start the students knowledge on alternative energies. Alternative energy is a highly publicized topic of conversation and students need to have a firm foundational understanding of alternative energy. Science should be learned by doing science and not by having to learn solely from websites and outdated textbooks.

Class sizes vary from 15-26 depending on the grade level. Currently they are in a class of 16. They are all eager to learn new things. Like all third graders, they enjoy playing games. They are a very close group who support and encourage each other. Most of them have attended the same school since PK. I am requesting board games to help with difficult concepts in reading. I have found that my students struggle with things like main idea. I chose sets of bingo and literacy games that I could use as a whole class or small group activity to help the students make meaningful and engaging connections to the concepts that they struggle with. I also requested math games and books that will help introduce new topics and give students hands on engagement with the new ideas. I also chose a set of timers to help assist in game play and keeping up with transition times between centers or games. Donations to my request will make a huge impact in my students' day to day learning experiences. I am a first year teacher who has few resources outside of the traditional textbook.

Now, we need to finish equipping our shop to make our students competitive with those from more affluent schools. The drill press will be one of the hardest working tools in the shop. The 3,339 mostly (91%) Latino students in grades 9 through 12 attend our school at the southern tip of the city of Los Angeles. Surrounded by several refineries and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the school serves a blue-collar, working class community with a substantially (70%) economically-disadvantaged population. The majority of our parents work for these industries and others in the Los Angeles industrial harbor vicinity. Our Robotics Team is made up of general and special ed students who are interested in design, engineering, and manufacturing. Before joining the team, many of them didn't know what type of work engineers do. After experiencing Robotics competitions, many of them want to become engineers. Each year in the FIRST Robotics Competition, students have six weeks to design and build a robot to compete in FRC's 'Varsity Sport for the Mind', a 3-on-3 high-energy robot sporting event. Students participate in a range of experiences they would otherwise be unlikely to experience. They communicate with local business representatives, develop and lead squads within the larger team to accomplish specific tasks, design parts and systems, produce digital renderings, solve difficult problems, and program computer micro-controllers. This intense event is made even more valuable when students have the equipment and materials available to properly fabricate parts. Students learn skills that are applicable to a wide range of jobs and careers. The safe and successful operation of machinery plays no small role in that experience. We are requesting a floor drill press that will serve our team for many years. Students will learn valuable job and craft skills. Our students are best served by being exposed to multiple career options and by learning skills that will serve them in many jobs. The U.S. needs more students with practical skills and experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Robotics serves this function beautifully. All of our students learn skills and practices that range from machine operation to project management. Few high school programs provide such rich learning experiences.

Many of my students do not have access to iPad's at home. We have students from many different cultures and countries (Mexico, Nepal, Burma, and India). Many of our students are refugees from refugee camps in their native country. Picture it...students having the latest technology in their hands for usage in the classroom.

Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

My students face challenges communicating and learning, but you can help. We are in need of basic classroom supplies to make picture supported materials for learning and communication opportunities. I am a Speech Language Pathologist in an inner city, high-need district. Our district is large (34 schools) and our needs are great. I provide direct therapy services to 25 students in 3 classrooms in our Autism program. The students in this program are challenged daily to communicate and interact with others. They have a wide range of communication skills and benefit from the use of visual supports when communicating and learning. Many of these students are non-verbal or have limited verbal skills and need speech generating devices to support their communication. This project will ensure that we will start the school year with a supply of materials to make the picture supports my students need to communicate and learn. The ink cartridges will be used to print pictures for communication books and to adapt materials for lessons and learning. The laminating pouches will make the pictures durable and last for the year. The glue sticks and velcro will be used to attach the pictures to many different surfaces in our room. Binders, sheet protectors, and file folders will be used for new communication books. We will use the construction paper, sentence strips and markers for adapted literacy lessons. These materials are crucial supplies in our classrooms and your funding will ensure that we have the necessary supplies to support the learning and communication needs of our students efficiently.

456a94e474debad17ade6ea2486faa74,Strengthen Those Hands,"Do you remember playing with Lego's, creating crafts, using Lincoln Logs, and spending the day using your hands? Unfortunately many children go through their early years without these crucial experiences that provide them with the prerequisite fine motor skills for school and academic success. I teach in a rural district in Colorado. Over half of the elementary school's population qualify for free and reduced lunches. The district is also low on funds as is true of most schools in our country which makes it difficult to stay current with new technology. There is a large ELL population within the school district as well. Students are eager to learn and becoming even more excited and engaged when technology is involved. Within the low-income population many students go through the early years without the experiences and practice to build foundational skills. Students are lacking these skills and in turn face many obstacles and struggles in today's rigorous classroom designs. The materials in this project include beads and laces, lacing boards, tweezers, scoop scissors, and boards where they are required to buckle, snap, lace, and tie. Students will be able to use these manipulative materials to not only gain fine motor strength but will build their manual dexterity as well. These are essential foundational skills that lead to success in the academic classroom. Students need to be able to use these muscles in their hands to complete a wide variety of tasks in the classroom. Most importantly, students need to be able to use these muscles effectively when writing. The act of stringing beads, lacing strings, fastening buckles, and using materials such as tweezers specifically target the small muscles needed to write. With the new rigorous curriculum designs being implemented in schools, students who are unable to use those muscles face many struggles. Students that have missed out on the experiences of using their hands before coming to school are in desperate need of early intervention. Being able to provide students with activities such as lacing beads, fastening buckles, tying laces, along with many others is crucial. Students who lack these skills not only struggle to use supplies such as scissors and crayons, but it is extremely cumbersome to work a pencil. Creating these experiences early is crucial to their success.

Our school is labeled a Title I school because the majority of our students live at or below the poverty level. Although my students deal with many hardships, they view school as a safe haven and come daily excited about what the day may hold. My students need basic school supplies such as crayons, pencils, markers, paper, pencil sharpeners, pencil boxes and other basic supplies to start the new school year. Our students deal with outside factors that tell them that education in not important, such as going to school without any supplies or not being encouraged to do their homework. I believe that providing them with basic supplies will not only encourage them to do their work, but it will also show them the importance of school because it proves that someone thinks enough about their education to provide them with what they need.

7182cb0ab622f059df9369b70c8f8089,The Art of Learning Language Arts in Kindergarten,"Benjamin Franklin said, 'Tell a student and they forget. Show a student and they will remember. Involve a student and they will LEARN.' This is my philosophy as well. Modern research confirms it. Our school has about 450 students. The majority of them, sixty-two percent, are disadvantaged. We also have students from middle to low middle income families. We have students from several ethnic backgrounds including Hispanic, African American, Native American, and Russian. Many of our students are from broken homes, one-parent families, and foster homes. Many of our grandparents are raising their grandchildren with no extra income provided. In some cases, both parents work and grandparents babysit to help out. We have students in need of food, clothing and toys that our school and other community organizations provide during the holidays and throughout the year when needed. Due to economic difficulties, two and three generations of families are living in the same house. The requested resources will help students use many of their senses to learn (touch, sound, sight). Whether a student is a visual, auditory, or kinetic learner, these resources will reinforce their way of learning. I especially like the letter sound blocks that can actually sound out the letters to make words. This will be a great asset when teaching students to blend the sounds to make words. With writing being a big component in the Common Core standards that schools are now using, the informational text materials will enable students to learn to write complete sentences about real things. All these resources are geared to reinforce our language arts curriculum and allow students to work in cooperative groups, in small groups led by the teacher, or individually, based on the students ability. Naturally, it is our goal as teachers to get the students to the point where they can use these resources and work independently with confidence. Students no longer just use books, paper and pencils to learn. Research has shown how hands-on learning will improve the students' chances to learn and succeed in the classroom. Since most of my students have no access to these learning tools at home, being able to offer these in the classroom will not only give them the opportunity to be involved in their own learning, but, it will enable them to have a better chance to succeed. Involve them and they will learn. ","My students need language arts supplies, games, puzzles, and other manipulatives.

In our music classes, we introduce composing using computers. Despite some having limited experience with music instruction, students don't balk at trying this new concept, and embrace it with enthusiasm. My students need 12 midi keyboards for our composing classes. My students have been entering notes in the Finale program, by clicking on each individual staff line or space to place the notes. This is difficult enough with a mouse, but we are using laptops, making it even trickier. With the purchase of these midi keyboards, students will be able to plug them in and play the note they wish to place instead. This will not only speed up their composing process, but will help them to learn the location of notes on a piano keyboard as well.

Although challenged by the environment outside of the school, my students work hard and try to make the most of their opportunity being at our school. They are great kids who are a joy to teach. One of my biggest concerns as a teacher is how can I help my students to be great writers. A document camera would help. I believe modeling is one of the most effective methods to teach students. I can walk them through the writing process all together with a document camera. Students can watch me write as the writing is projected onto the screen. Even better, the students themselves can demonstrate their writing skills by having their writing projected on the screen with the document camera. Students who have done a great job on an essay can have their essay be shown to the class for positive reinforcement and as a positive example. We can revise each other's writing together using the document camera. With this tool, it can make writing a cooperative and interactive activity in our classroom. It is no secret that writing is a problem for many high school students, and especially for those in urban settings. With a document camera, students will have a chance to more easily see good writing, without having to waste tons of paper making copies, and will want to get engaged in the writing process.

They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. A dedicated group of students will be traveling through the United Kingdom. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the economic structure of an international superpower, compare the education system with that of our own, and strengthen their interview and public speaking skills by shadowing employers.

Once the 'chest' is open, students are touched with the treasure of reading. Reading holds the key to students success! Most of my students come from homes that are underprivileged. They have limited access to books outside of school. Most of their engagement with texts happens in the classroom or the school library. Our school is home to a population of 93% children of poverty. Even though most of my students face hardship, they come to school excited about learning, especially reading. With the resources I've requested, my students will be interacting in reading literacy centers. I've requested grade level book sets to have my students engage in book groups. This opportunity would allow them to discuss books as a group and learn together. I've also requested some picture books to read aloud to my students. We will use these texts to show how authors use writing in powerful ways, practice reading comprehension skills, and use before, during, and after reading strategies. With these powerful tools, my students' reading comprehension and enjoyment will increase. I hope to see a positive boost in reading success levels with the use of these resources. This project is immensely crucial to impact student learning. I believe in exposing children to great literature and to use authors as supplemental teachers in my classroom.

My students need some extra room to store our athletic supplies for our new sports teams, and these shelves will give us a lot of space to work with. I work in a low-income (Title One) school in South Tucson. This previous year was our first year having our own sports program, and it is expanding exponentially in the upcoming school year. For many of these kids, our sports programs are their primary extracurricular activity and is certainly helpful in keeping them out of trouble and off the streets. These shelves are not a direct boon to the students learning specifically. What these shelves will allow us to do is create a specific space for the sporting goods that we will use for our teams: uniforms, equipment, and miscellaneous things (like coolers) that will be used to support our sports program. Without being able to have room to store our equipment and to keep it organized, we will inevitably discover that we are short of resources, as has happened in our previous year. This way, we will be able to keep track of how much we have and what we need, keeping our resources more tightly controlled. This sports program is really a big factor for our students. We have had a tremendous amount of interest by the students, and we need to be able to have an organized, secure space that will allow us to keep our equipment ready for the upcoming sports seasons. This will make the organization of the sport easier for the school, allowing us to get right into the business of playing and learning each one in its season this year.

Although it was filled with graphics and colorful pictures, often it was hard to read and comprehend. With your help, my students won't have to experience frustration reading nonfiction text. I am starting a new adventure with a new district and a new campus! The campus I will be attending is a Title 1 school. This means that most of the students I will be serving will come from low socioeconomic environments that face many challenges. The school serves about 900 students and 85 percent are on free/reduced lunch. We also have a large number of refugees that attend our school. Most of my students face academic challenges due to their backgrounds and home lives. Among these challenges are dyslexia, slow-learners, learning disabilities, and language. However, I will also have students who are on and above grade-level that would benefit from this enrichment. I am determined to meet the needs of ALL my students. For many decades, reading and writing has mostly been composed of make believe; fairytales, talking animals, and magic. Students find themselves addicted to these types of text as well as movies. They rarely run to the nonfiction section of the library. It is important that I teach my students the importance of factual information and how to summarize and decide what's important. Although my students are in 3rd grade I want them to be college ready! Being able to comprehend informational and expository text is a must-have skill for college and for life. The Research and Respond Comprehension center will allow my students to increase their comprehension skills with 3 easy steps: preview, read, and respond. After these steps they are required to respond to follow-up questions that reinforce the content. My students will be exposed to high-interest text that I'm sure they will love to read! Maybe they'll even explore the nonfiction section of the library! Research shows that although students are reading on an average of 25 minutes a day, only 4-5 minutes are allocated to nonfiction. (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010) With your help, I believe we can change how students feel about nonfiction. These products will expose my students to high- interest text that will captivate and get their attention.

Some with backpacks full of new pencils, notebooks, tissues, and folders. Others walk into school empty handed. A few materials will trickle in over the next week, but generally students either have them or not. My 4th grade class has 30 students. We are located in an urban district in New York. I have a goal that my students will become a community of learners and help each other grow. It is a beautiful system that allows for students of all academic levels to learn at their instructional level. I am trying to encourage thinking and exploration as a part of learning. I use hands-on practice to explore concepts and encourage team work. Teaching students at all of their diverse levels is a challenge, but it helps each of them to grow to their potential. The students work in partners and small groups regularly, and students really work together to help each other be successful. My students come from a variety of home situations, so they are learning academic and social skills during all subjects. The basic school supplies that I have requested will be used for the students that come to school empty handed. These students are generally from unstable homes, so they aren't able to get them from their parents. When these boys and girls walk into the classroom, I just want them to feel loved, accepted, and eager to learn. So, I usually end up buying supplies for about half of my class, which can become very costly. This allows for me to teach students organization from the first day of school. It also allows for us to get started right away. We are able to set up a good routine from the beginning of the year, and we don't have to wait until all supplies are in. We also pool our supplies together as a class. Each student can use the notebooks and folders that they bring in, but things like pencils, glue sticks, post-it notes, etc. go into shared bins. If we only get these supplies from half of the class, then we run out halfway through the year and I purchase refills. You will make a HUGE difference, even though the supplies requested seem so basic. These supplies will be used to help our class work from the first day of school, all the way to the end of the year. Your donation will ease the mind of a 9 year old who knows that his mom can't afford supplies, and he feels guilty even asking.

My school does not have the funding to buy many extra materials such as math manipulatives for classrooms, so math time can be a challenge for some of my students. My fourth-graders need concrete, hands on practice with different fraction concepts. I am requesting fraction pieces in tile and circle form to help my students visualize fractions in different forms. I am also requesting fraction games to give my students more practice with manipulating fractions. My students are always much more willing to practice math if the math topics are presented as a game! The Common Core State Standards for fourth grade have a strong focus on fractions, including finding equivalence, adding, subtraction, multiplication, and ordering of fractions. These fraction manipulatives will allow my students to easily visualize fraction problems and be more successful at the tasks that they need to accomplish. Math topics build on each other and without a strong base many students struggle in math class.

These amazing students deserve a chance to experience reading and have a love of books. We are a Title I school, but that does not stop the children from being the best they can be and giving it their all in the classroom. Having a rug in the reading area of the classroom will provide a comfortable and inviting space where students will want to open up a book. Students are more likely to focus on what they are reading if they feel comfortable. Indulging in reading will help increase their vocabulary, which is crucial for ELL's. It will also benefit their analytical thinking, writing skills, and hopefully instill in them the value of being life-long learners and readers. I have tried my best to create a classroom that every student in the world deserves. I know my classroom is an inviting place where students feel welcome, but the last piece of the puzzle that is missing is a rug to relax on and open up a book. I want all of my students to have a love for books, and I feel a rug to read on will help create an environment in which this can happen.

Or perhaps, wanted to show something enhanced right away? As a teacher, this is our life- to share! Both my eighth graders and myself are eager to share everything we learn and know with our class. A document camera will enable us to do so. I teach in a Title One, diverse, multi-cultural school. With over 29 languages represented on our campus, we need all the tools we can use to communicate with our students. My eighth graders love math and technology, and luckily math is a universal language. Our school is in a low socioeconomic neighborhood but full of eager, creative learners. In our district, our goal is to have all children excelling and to be college and career ready. We follow the common core standards to ensure that all students are getting the same quality education. My students get so excited when we are able to experience new learning through our smart boards, graphing calculators, laptop carts, and responders; however, we have needs that a document camera would fulfill. With the document camera, my students will have greater opportunities to share their work and discoveries, and learn in a more dynamic way! This will lead to greater listening and work skills. With this, they can share in a positive, encouraging manner. They will be able to use and display math manipulatives under the camera to explain thinking, as well as share their work and steps. Our school is big on STEM teaching in our classrooms, which allows more investigative exploration of topics. As a teacher, I would be able to model more efficiently to the class as a whole. This will also save A LOT of time, for documents not available for the smart board to view, will be able to be shown and not needed to be copied onto a whiteboard. Picture your child in a classroom with a document camera, would you not feel more confident in the learning taking place verses not having a document camera? They truly do help speed up the learning process, while making the learning more engaging and fun! Technology is the future! This will give our students another opportunity to be challenged and to express their ideas and thinking in a different, functional way. It is a more efficient way for me to model, to demonstrate, to display my graphing calculator to teach steps, and to show each other'ÂÂs work, which will enhance learning and knowledge of the world around us.

I am asking for two students that will be mainly used during our math block and any other available times during the day to practice math skills. The students will be using the iPods, through the use of various apps, to practice number identification, number manipulation and math facts. All of these skills practiced daily through fun apps instead of boring paper and pencil activities will not only differentiate the learning based on each student but will make learning fun and exciting while preparing my students to soar through math!I want my students to reach their full potential and not get left behind in the dust. The iPods will be able to make learning fun and improve my studentsÂÂ math skills. Through your donations you will have the opportunity to take part in growing children into confident mathematicians. I believe that my students could reach their full potential and master the building blocks of math this year if they could only have a chance at having fun while learning math skills. I believe the usage of iPods with fun and exciting math apps will help them reach that goal. Please participate and ignite the fire in my students for math!

My class consists of 20 third grade students who are all anxious and excited about the idea of having a full library with a wide variety of books to explore. Unfortunately, because my school is in a majority low income district, many of my students have not had the luxury of being able to explore through good quality literature. Most of the books that the students at my school get their hands on are books that are outdated, destroyed, and simply not that exciting or engaging to read. My students have yet to experience books that truly allow them to 'go anywhere in the world'. Inevitably, their lack of being exposed to a wide variety of literature has caused their experiences to be limited, thus limiting them when it comes to each of them reaching their full learning potential. Through enriching literature, my students will not only become better readers but I feel that they will become more excited about learning. This will then create life long learners who journey the world through the pages of literature. Through reading, I would like to truly impact the lives of my students. I understand that reading can influence my students to become the life long readers and learners I hope for. By creating a library full of enriching literature, my students will have no other choice but to get excited about reading and learning. With a wide variety of leveled readers and popular chapter books, I will surly be able to motivate each and every one of my students to be excited about exploring literature with me!

3a62d5dd2ff3c1c54f071a492b4b1400,You Can't Learn What You Can't See,"My students are writers, poets, and artists, but don't have the technology resources necessary to share their work and learn from each other. The first graders in my class are hardworking and hungry to learn. Despite their persistence, they face substantial obstacles: 94% of the students at our school receive free or reduced price lunch and the majority of the students in my class are English Language Learners who speak Spanish at home. In my dual immersion class, all students are working on learning or improving their Spanish language comprehension, so visual supports are key to understanding. Without any way to share class work or assignments with all the students, however, many will not be able to see and therefore miss out on the lesson. Being able to show exactly how to perform a new task, or better yet, having a student demonstrate it, is far more powerful for a learner than just being told. A document camera is a boring name for a fantastic device: by hooking it up to an LCD projector, students will be able to project a large image of their work so that all their peers can see and learn from it. When I teach a new strategy, I can demonstrate for the whole group how to employ it, from revising a piece of writing to creating a diagram to solve a math problem. Students will easily transfer a skill to their own work because they've gotten to see exactly how it's done: no telling necessary. I've seen document cameras in action in classrooms, and their impact across the curriculum is impressive. In reading, picture books can be shared so that all students can notice and make inferences from the illustrations. In math, different methods of solving the same problem can be quickly compared. In writing, the teacher can demonstrate a new technique and then show student examples of that skill the very same day. This little camera quickly becomes integrated into the life of the class because it allows the group to achieve something that both teachers and students crave; the ability to easily, almost effortlessly, share the products of student learning so all can see, understand and build on what's been done. This device will drive students to create and show their very best.

Through small group work and learning centers I know I can create a classroom environment that is successful and effective for all my students! My classroom is currently full of 34 second grade students who are all eager to learn and come from very diverse and difficult backgrounds. I teach in a high poverty neighborhood in Arizona, where most of the population in our school are English Language Learners. Our kids have a strong desire to learn and challenge themselves, despite the hard challenges they face at home. They are extremely hard workers and push themselves to 'Achieve the American Dream'.Teaching with small groups and learning centers gives each child the time, effort and education they deserve, and with this teaching easel that can be done so much easier. Our space in limited with so many students, and so many desks so we are trying to find creative ways to store manipulatives and items the students need to use. However, with this storage cart and easel in one I can create centers or small group work that the students will be able to access all in one place. My students deserve the best education possible, and tools such as this easel will help provide quick transitions and easy access, in order to promote more learning time. I can see my students teaching each other using this easel as well, and I cannot wait to put this resource to use in my classroom! I truly believe that a large teaching easel/storage cart could make a huge difference in my students' behavior and learning opportunities. My students will have easy access to learning centers and small group work, which in turn will allow me to meet the needs of my students much more effectively!

The ELMO document camera will allow my students to engage in all-class discussions while viewing historic photographs, political cartoons, posters, letters, speeches, and more. A big component of my history class is working with students to develop higher order thinking skills. These skills will enable them to analyze and engage with media messages they see on a daily basis, encouraging them to view everything with a critical eye. I believe that a big part of getting students engaged with history is answering the question: Why does this matter to me?

Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly.

We work as hard as we can to reach up, and to make the goals that seem extreme become reality. My students are some of the most caring, loving kids you will ever meet - but their love cannot buy them the supplies they need for their daily activities in the classroom. My students attend an inner-city school that has a very low-income average. Actually, the poverty level in my school is so low that all students receive free breakfast and lunch everyday. They also face many challenges in their homes that they have to overcome just to be able to make it to school, much less making it there with more than the bare minimum required to start the day. However, my students are also hungry to learn, and work extremely hard with what we do have to succeed at the highest levels. For my classes, I am requesting materials to build a writing resource center. The materials to do this include pencils, loose leaf paper, construction paper, and materials to help us organize the center itself. With these materials, I hope to help both of my classes of students create authentic and inspirational writing. We will use them in our writers workshop where we will be creating stories, as well as learning to form arguments, which will then be presented to our class as we learn public speaking skills. We will also use the construction paper in our other classes, as we create and design materials to improve our understanding and engagement in what we are learning.

You will never be without laughter on any given day in my classroom. These students are full of potential, but have been broken down by the gaps in education and poverty that engulf their Texas community. My kids will most likely get by if they continue on their current path right now. They will find jobs, get married, and have children. But they will not be living up to their potential. For the most part, they will work in blue-collar jobs and will struggle to provide for their families. Many of them will not go to and through college because they will not be able to afford it and will not know how to succeed in an environment with a whole new level of rigor.

Within our health science program, we offer Health Science 1, Health Science 2, Health Science 3, Sports Medicine 1, Sports Medicine 2, Sports Medicine Internship, and Medical Terminology. All of these courses are designed to motivate students to pursue a health care career. In five of those seven courses the students learn anatomy and physiology of the human body. These charts will help give my students a much better visual of what they are made of and the various systems that are working at any given moment of the day. I will be able to use the charts as references right there in the classroom instead of searching in a book or the Internet for a decent picture. The students will also be able to use them as a reference as they work through various projects associated with each body system. Think about the people who will be taking care of you as you grow older and encounter sickness. Think about your loved ones who may be in the hospital. Who is going to be taking care of you? The answer is the students that we are teaching now. Help me give these students a better understanding of the human body and health care.

'You can find magic wherever you look, sit back and relax, all you need is a book,' by Dr. Seuss. This quote will increase the students' motivation to read. My students are all well-rounded individuals, who have not made the adequate growth in reading that is expected. They attend a low-income school in a K-12 building. The students can develop close relationships with their peers and the teachers. The students mean well and do not have any behavior problems. We have been working hard on developing fluent and accurate readers. Please help us reach our goals. The plastic book boxes will replace the worn out cardboard ones we have previously used. The students use their book boxes multiple times throughout the day during Daily 5 instructional time. The plastic ones will be more durable for student use and will provide more color to the classroom. I am trying to increase the students motivation to read and grow a passion for reading. I will be starting 'flashlight Friday,' where the lights will be shut off and the students will use their flashlight to read. My hope for this will increase the students motivation and reading fluency and of course be fun for the students. Donations for this project will make a difference in my students lives by improving their reading scores. Reading is such an essential life skill, that having non-proficient readers is inexcusable.

Many of the headphones that are on our mobile lab are 5 years old and are broken. Many of my 3rd graders cannot hear the math problems or the stories on Successmaker, which is our individualized learning program. Our charter school has students from a broad economic background. Many families are Title One families. We have to rely on the support of grants or donations to get most of our technology. Unfortunately, when we have our mobile computer lab, many of the students are frustrated because we do not have enough headphones for the students to use. Many of the original headphones are now 5 years old and broken. There are no headphones to use. The students cannot hear the Successmaker program. All students benefit with reading and listening to the program. It helps with their fluency as well. Students who have a low reading level are at a particular disadvantage using our Successmaker program because they cannot read accurately and with fluency the problems on the computer screen without headphones. I believe all of my students need reliable headphones. If each child has their very own headphone to be responsible for, I believe that they will last several years. My Project: The most important computer program in our school for math and reading is our Successmaker computer program. Successmaker is unique in that it can find the student's ability level through questions and problems that the student answers. Then Successmaker individualizes the program to each student's abilities. With a headphone, each one of my students will be able to understand not only by sight, but by hearing the words and sounds all of the educational activities on Successmaker. This will definitely impact the ability of my students to learn their math and reading in 3rd grade. Each of my students will succeed and get confident in their understanding of important concepts of the Common Core. When each student has their own headphone, they will be responsible for a certain labeled headphone that will be placed in a storage bin. I have students of all levels of reading and math ability that need to understand through sight and sound the educational activities on Successmaker. All of my twenty-seven students will achieve to their highest potential when they have the advantage of not only seeing the problems, but hearing the stories and activities on the computer program. This will maximize their learning. Headphones are an invaluable tool for my class to have. Thank you for your support!

Storage sacks will be a great benefit to my students to help them stay organized. My fourth graders attend an elementary school in California's largest urban school district. They come from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as different socioeconomic statuses, which means that some have more access to resources than others. I would like to use Donors Choose as a vehicle in supplying a much needed resource, chair/storage sacks, in order to teach my students how to be and stay organized. No matter what grade level I've taught, from Kindergarten to fourth grade, teaching students to be, and stay, organized has always been a challenge. It isn't a state standard, it's not tested, but it's an important life skill. With chair sacks, students will learn how to keep their things in order. Learning how to be organized will greatly benefit them now and in the future. Please help with our class project however you can!

For most students this will never be a concern, but for my students this is a daily frustration. Help us gain access to the simple joy of recess time. My students are all hard working, funny, and smart. They each have an exceptional smile and laughter that brightens everyone's day. My students inspire me with their individual challenges, unique view of the world we live in, and outpouring of love they have for everyone they meet. My students faced the challenges daily, of having a significant cognitive, physical, social and or speech disability, and are teaching us all how amazing they are, and how lucky we are to know them, and have them in our lives. This project will help the special education students at our school have access to a playground that is currently not accessible to a child with severe cognitive and physical disabilities. Access to the swing will not only provide the child with a disability access, but it will also teach the child without a disability that all children like to swing, regardless of physical ability. The swing will also open up natural opportunities for peer interactions that would not occur otherwise, as the supervising adult can safely step back and allow the non-disabled peers to facilitate the interactive play. This project is so important because it helps bridge the gap between children. Not only does the swing give all kids access to the playground at recess, but it also teaches the kids without disabilities that even though a child has a disability they still enjoy playing and can do the same things as their friends with modifications, helping facilitate positive interactions, and friendships.

I would like to be able to share that wonderful feeling with the students in my classroom. I have a class of 14 sweet kindergarteners who are eager to learn and experience the fun and excitement that comes with being able to attend school. We are a small school in a region of Virginia that has been hit very hard by a faltering economy and the loss of jobs. We are in great need of supplies for daily use in the classroom. Those supplies include large kindergarten crayons, scissors that are safe for small hands, large pencils that are easy for those small hands to grip as they learn how to write, and glue sticks so they can be creative, as well as other items. With the assistance of these items and supplies, my students will learn how to hold and use a pencil/crayon correctly, how to cut using scissors that are made specifically for young children, and how to be creative. We will not only use these supplies for daily activities such a handwriting, coloring, and picture sorts, but also for exciting craft experiences that inspire creative learning. This project is important because kindergarten is the first time some of these children are experiencing school with the exception of those children who attended some form of pre-school. I would like to ensure that these children get every possible benefit from this experience so that they may be fully prepared to go on to do great things in the future.

My goals as a music educator are to instill in my students an appreciation for all things surrounding the arts and to create independent life-long learners of music as well as life. In order for students to become life-long musicians and music learners it is important for students to understand the history of music and great historical figures in music history. Often times students have a difficult time learning about the great classical composers of our past, because they have a difficult time connecting to people that lived so long ago. The Composer DVDs make the lives of famous classical composers such as Bach, Handel and Strauss (to name a few) come alive, while connecting their stories to real life situations that current students can relate to.

It is today that we must create the world of the future.'~Eleanor Roosevelt 'Nothing But the Truth' integrates Civics into the English classroom. My lessons begin by having students explore cases where claims were made that students' first amendment rights were violated. My students are motivated kids who want to learn. This year is a giant transition for them as their middle school was shut down due to budget cuts and they were moved to the local high school where I teach. For the most part, they are the group that represents the above average sector of their grade level, and I believe that researching first amendment court cases and then reading 'Nothing But the Truth' will produce critical thinking and writing from this group. The school they attend is in a lower socioeconomic area where there is little parental involvement. The majority of our school population receives free or reduced lunch. Our district offers free breakfast and most of our students take advantage of this as the free breakfast and free lunch might be all they eat that day. Additionally the students come to me with very little prior or background knowledge of the world outside their community which makes discussion of literature difficult. I will be able to integrate civics into the English classroom by doing a pre-reading activity with the first amendment. Students will understand the first amendment of the constitution as it applies to public school students. They will learn concepts such as advocacy of illegal action, commercial speech, and forum. They will research cases where students' first amendment rights were violated such as Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) where students were suspended for wearing black armbands as a silent protest to the Vietnam War. They will identify the facts of each case, each sides' position, the decision held by the court, and its effect on the country. Students will be grouped by case and will create a digital presentation to share with the class. As a class, we will then read 'Nothing But the Truth' where a student is suspended for humming/singing along to the Star-Spangled Banner instead of standing at silent, respectful attention. We will conclude with a persuasive writing opportunity. Students will have the opportunity to read from books that are new and not falling apart from being used for year after year after year.

My students all attend a public school and spend some time in a special education setting and some time with their typical peers. They have a wide range of skill levels and abilities, but they are all on a functional life skills curriculum, meaning their goals in school are to learn basic skills required to navigate life. With the addition of cooking supplies, including a skillet, a griddle, a crock pot, and kitchen utensils, my students will have the opportunity to learn to make and/or assist in making simple meals. We will be able to make a wide array of foods traditionally cooked on a stovetop including pancakes, tacos, and spaghetti. They will also be given the opportunity to try new foods that they have not tasted in the past, broadening their food preferences through experience.

I am an early childhood special education teacher in a low-income, high-needs public school. My young learners are three to five years old, and each one has an educational disability and/or a developmental delay that impacts his/her functioning and academic achievement. What does 'rocking and 'recking' have to do with learning, anyway? Regulating (calming) activities, like rocking in a rocking chair or building with safe foam blocks and then knocking them down, give children a sense of mastery and calm. My young students are as dysregulated much of the time as you are on those really awful mornings, and having equipment and materials in the classroom to help them calm and focus so they can learn is vital to their success. Help make a difference in these young lives. You will feel happy that you've helped.

No money has been allocated for purchase of ANY creative materials or activities. Our students face the challenge of learning in a date driven environment. Teachers need to justify every minute of the day and show how all activities will produce results. The new teaching model is all about Common Core Assessments. Our students are no different than anyone else's. They enjoy learning but not when they are being bored to tears. They are diverse learners who have their own strengths and individual weaknesses. They learn best when they are stimulated. They have proved this year that when they are allowed to be creative, they are much more motivated to do their best. Our next Common Core Module study is on Colonialism. There are countless pages of worksheets to accompany this module. We would like for the children to experience Colonialism by creating their own Colonial Journals. Collaboratively, they will use the journals to depict aspects of daily life for colonial children and compare them to modern day life. Partners will then create masks and author plays in which they will act out the different aspects of daily life - depicting a comparison of today and yesterday. Rather than complete a graphic organizer, children will be bringing colonial times to life and really get a sense of what it was like to live during the days of our Founding Fathers. Not all children learn the same way. However, Common Core Modules force children, no matter their talent, to fill out worksheet after worksheet based on written material. It is critical to give every child the opportunity to show their strengths. While some thrive on written material, others need to be creative. While some work well alone, others need to collaborate. While some can read texts and spit facts back out, others prefer to think critically to develop their own opinion. Help us shine!

They work hard in speech therapy, but despite their best efforts, there are a few sounds they struggle to master (especially /s/ and /r/). Cutting edge therapy tools, such as Speech Buddies, will give these kids a chance of conquering their targeted sounds. Speech Buddies are radically different from other articulation tools.

My students are committed to their education in both an academic and personal sense. They seek out opportunities, such as the chance to study the culture of Morocco, in order to learn more about the world they live in and their place in it. These high school students hope to strengthen their understanding of the world as they begin to explore their collegiate opportunities, and plan for their futures. The opportunity for students to experience learning on the international stage has long been relegated to those who are financially able to attain these goals. However, my colleagues and I believe that these experiences should be available to all students. In the months leading up to their trip, my students begin conducting research in various areas of the culture of Morocco. For many students, this is the first time they are able to completely self-direct their learning, focusing on various aspects of culture- from fashion trends and choices, to studying the education system in the country they visit. Students will conclude their research by visiting the country they are studying, gaining the chance to live like a local and to see the world from a new perspective. Students gain the opportunity to grow as individuals and as learners as they gain college credit for their research endeavors. In addition, students have the opportunity to give back.

The most effect literacy building activity, which helps to develop math, reading and writing skills, has been introducing the opera to middle school students. Adding technology, like the downloading tunes to student iPods/MP3 players will bring the operas and musicals to the 21st century. Using programs like Discovery Education also transforms classrooms and inspires teachers with engaging content, to fully engaged students in reading the stories, characters, settings, costumes, orchestral music, and actual singing. This project will allow me to use every resource to broaden students' musical and cultural experiences, and continue students regular attendance to the Florida Grand Opera's full dress rehearsals.

134368a11fdaf04492c90bcc9b3899c1,Enriching Storytelling,"Do you remember wanting to hear the same story over and over again as a child? The ability to re-tell a story is an incredible way to build reading comprehension and vocabulary, especially for children with little or no experience with books and stories. My students are enrolled in the first year of the new Indianapolis Public Schools preschool program. They are four and five years old and they are eager learners ready to learn and explore. Many have not experienced daily stories or literature at home and 95% qualify for free or reduced price lunch. Our classroom is housed in an urban, elementary school. The flannel board materials and books that I am requesting will help my students increase their reading comprehension and vocabulary. With the movable flannel pieces that the children will recognize from the stories that they hear in class, the children can re-tell the stories in their own words, building on their ability to recall and remember details from literature, which will equalize their learning readiness to their suburban peers. These children have not had many experiences with stories and books. These materials will give them the opportunity to explore, feel and tell the stories in their words, encouraging learning while they feel they are 'playing.' Since they work in small groups while using the materials, they also engage in conversations with each other, increasing their confidence, verbal skills, and social skills. This pre-K program was designed to give urban children the same opportunities that their suburban peers receive from home or private preschools. We are a universal free school lunch school. Most of my students have not experienced literature and storytelling in their homes. We have one copy of 'Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?,' and the students eagerly wait their turn 'reading' it each day. These materials will truly enrich their vocabularies and story re-telling abilities.

My school is a Title I school with more than 70% of our students on free or reduced-price lunch. Our students are composed mainly of minority groups who come from low socio-economic background. Often they are at a disadvantage because they have difficulty providing for themselves the required resources they need to be competitive in school. To be successful in calculus, my students need to constantly practice their learning and acquired skills and knowledge by doing homework, which more often than not requires a graphing calculator. I would like to have extra calculators that I can check out to them to help them with their homework.

Technology is not the future, because it is already here. The use of technology allows our students to become engage in complex texts and become life-long learners. My students are in a Chicago Public School which has an enrollment of 1,350 students, with 88% of them being low-income and 32% English language learners. My students love to use technology whenever they get the chance because many do not have much technology when they leave the school. As educators who are able to buy certain technological devices, we tend to forget that many of our students do not have that opportunity. Technology is the new resource that engages our students and challenges them academically. Every Monday my students read differentiated articles and answer questions about the article using an online program called Teen Biz. There is a huge problem with implementing this program for all of my students because we do not have enough netbooks for my students. My classes range from 33-38 students! I have to allow my students to use my personal tablet and laptop because we only have 30 netbooks. I also have to send two students to two different classroom to use a desktop. Even with all of these accommodations, there is always at least 2 or 3 students that are not able to do Teen Biz because we do not have enough netbooks. Although some of my students use their cellphones to complete the articles and questions, the small screen on the phones is not beneficial to reading long articles and answering questions. The use of the requested tablets will also serve as an additional resource for my ELL's and struggling readers with the use of specific apps. The tablets will also serve as additional research devices. Honestly, it is a struggle to implement Teen Biz because we need more technological devices. The tablets will allow more students to do Teen Biz activities and improve their literacy skills. Technology motivates and engages all students, regardless of their academic level. The tablets will also expose them to more complex texts, allow my ELL's to acquire language faster, and serve as an additional technological resource in the classroom.

Like I said, my students love reading. Here's the thing: My school serves a very diverse population. Some first graders come to school reading words and even sentences. Other children enter first grade as emergent readers, still working on letter identification and letter sounds. The widest range of learners are found in first grade. Reading levels range from Level A to Level J. Wow! We spend a great deal of time working in small groups, addressing the skills individual students need to strengthen. I spend many hours researching the best ways to meet my students' needs. Technology is one tool that can be used in a variety of ways to help me meet those needs. My school believes in technology. We've made fundraising efforts for technology support. However, most of that technology is used by students in grades 2-6. My classroom has 2 desktop computers for students to use. I would like to change that. I want to provide another form of technology for my students that supports their learning. Kindle now offers many high quality learning apps that cover a range of learning skills and levels. My goal is to furnish my classroom with at least 6 Kindles.

A dry erase white board allowing students to write their ideas for all to see is one way to motivate our young learners. I teach bright highly motivated first grade students in a New York City public school. We live in the borough of Queens, a part of our nation that enjoys a deserved reputation for diversity. Our school community is an international one and we share the rich heritage of many cultures. With that diversity and global perspective comes expectations to bring the best resources and education possible to young children who seek to achieve academic success. Our young parents are keenly aware of new ways of learning and the power of interactivity in that process. We know that learning from peers is an integral part of the acquisition of knowledge and sometimes simple tools can go far to achieve that goal. Our families are our partners in learning and support us in ways that include class visits to celebrate student work. I have seen the excitement students have in putting their work on the blackboard in the front of the room. I have also discovered that as we move around, students are eager to share their work but need something portable on which to write. The dry erase board is a simple tool that requires no technological expertise yet it encourages students who work in groups to share by simply writing or drawing their ideas. I have requested a dry erase board that is 4 feet by 6 feet so it is large enough for a group to post ideas yet small enough to be portable. This dry erase board can be moved with ease around the room, has a stand, is relatively light, and can even be propped up against the blackboard in the front of the room. This is a low tech solution to increasing interactivity, motivating student participation that enhances engagement. I have also requested different colored dry erase markers for students to use. Students love to write on a board (usually a blackboard) and this dry erase board gives us the opportunity to write anywhere in the room, as groups convene for independent work. This board doesn't require electrical power or special training to use, is dust free, and and can encourage student participation as the children write their ideas for all to see.

Each student's presentation and report will be evaluated using a rubric reflecting common Core Standards in the areas of speaking and listening. This project will give them the hands-on materials they need to experiment with the things they are learning about in Science. The materials will be placed in their non-fiction center where they can experiment with each one. Research supports the notion that anyone can greatly reduce their fears of public speaking through a series of presenting 22 or more oral presentation sessions. These materials will make a difference in the lives of my students because it will give them the opportunity to truly experiment with things they are learning about which will cultivate a curiosity and love of learning in them.

Just go sharpen it. But the teacher's ancient pencil sharpener won't sharpen evenly. A heavy duty electric pencil sharpener could easily solve this problem. I teach 110 awesome seventh grade English students. We spend a large percentage of our time writing about literature, current events, and the crazy events that make up their lives. Our transition to common core has increased the amount of time that we spend writing. After our school experienced a devastating tornado on May 20, we have been fortunate to receive donations of pencils and paper to last throughout the year. One item that would help significantly is an electric pencil sharpener. It would allow students to quickly and efficiently sharpen their pencils and return to work. A heavy duty electric pencil sharpener placed in the front of the classroom will allow students to sharpen their pencils as soon as they enter the room so that they can begin working as soon as class starts. It will be convenient for use anytime during class as well. Electric pencil sharpeners sharpen more quickly and accurately than the old sharpeners that we already use. Their sharp pencils will help their brilliant ideas flow onto their paper! We have an old crank-style pencil sharpener and a couple of dozen handheld pencil sharpeners, but the addition of an electric pencil sharpener would cut down on the number of times that students needed to get up out of their seats, therefore allowing them to spend more time on task. Also, a sharp pencil makes the students feel like he or she is doing the best work possible!

They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. We have a rapidly expanding band program. If the rate of growth keeps up, I will not be able to get instruments to all the students who want to join band next year. I have been acquiring instruments in every way I can, but even with the used instruments I've been able to acquire, I haven't been able to keep up with the need for instruments among students who couldn't otherwise afford to rent or buy one from a music store. This instrument will not only give many students an enriching opportunity to learn to play saxophone, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing this saxophone could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special.

Their parents are very supportive and work with their children to ensure success in school. Our students are bright and motivated. They enjoy learning about and using new technology. They amaze us with their ideas and willingness to persevere when faced with a problem. Our students have been creating products digitally, and we are ready to go to the next level and use the skills they have learned to have an object come to life. We think the best way to get started is with the Lego Robotics kit. Students will then be able to design and create a robot of any style and with any function. Seeing their designs come to life will allow our students to experience a true 21st century classroom. The skills students will acquire by learning to use a true robotics kit will help them throughout their school career and into the workforce.

Many don't get the opportunity to bring supplies to school. Their parents often have to make the choice between paying bills, or buying supplies...buying groceries, or buying supplies. As a result, I try to stand in the gap as much as possible, purchasing basic supplies whenever I can. As the prices increase from year to year, this becomes more challenging for me.

We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. Students will be mainly using these vices to make me deaf. Okay, not really. Vices are an essential tool in any shop- holding pieces to be cut, pressing bits together, hammering on the anvil, bending, the list could go on for miles. We mainly use these vices in my metals class- where I teach them how to punch holes in metal, set rivets, groove seams, and straighten projects that might have gotten a little off kilter. How will this make a difference? Well, It will let my students DOUBLE their productivity. Instead of 20 students in 2 lines waiting for a vise, I'll have 20 students in 4 lines waiting.

Or the voice of your teacher turns into the monotonous tones of Charlie Brown's teacher? Anyone who has been a student can attest to this feeling. In the digital world, 21st century learners are struggling more than ever to stay engaged in a lesson. All you have to do is Google, 'kids attention span and technology,' and you will get a plethora of articles and studies arguing that the digital world we live in has desensitized children to heavy stimulation. I find myself working harder than ever to keep sound teaching practices engaging for my students. In addition, the majority of my students come from low socioeconomic backgrounds, their cultural and academic experiences diminish their confidence when it comes time to crack open the textbook or begin writing. Too often I see them mentally checked out before they even have to get started! In turn, they get frustrated and lose enthusiasm in what we're learning! Hand them an iPad, however, and no matter what you ask them to do, they are ready and motivated to take on whatever challenge you give them! With iPads, I can begin incorporating this interactive technology into my daily lessons. The options are endless. Individual students, who seriously struggle with motivation to read, can use the iPads to access the online textbook, which enhances the reading with videos and animated pictures. Students can work in collaborative groups to access my Prezis, digitally stimulating presentations, and take control of their own learning. With the Adobe Reader app, students can have directions, quizzes or other activities read to them. Quizlet will enable students to take assessments online and receive immediate feedback to maximize their learning. The iPads will engage, motivate and enable students to interact with their learning! By supporting this project you will enable my students to learn more deeply and in an exciting and memorable way. In addition to their learning, you will help my students gain confidence as learners and people as they see their curiosity and hard work turn into success.

Kennedy. A powerful statement that empowers me to provide my students with fun and interactive ways to keep their minds bursting with knowledge. My students have bright smiles that light up the classroom despite their disabilities that range from moderate to severe diagnosis. Each day they are exposed to functional learning experiences that engage their minds and help them to understand the world they are living in. Our school community welcomes students with disabilities and promotes an inclusive setting. It is in these exclusive settings that my students are able to work with their same age peers and develop friendships. Physical Education is an important part of my students' fine and gross motor skills development. My students need more instructional time to master movement concepts and instruction needs to be engaging, creative, and fun! The target toss and comet balls are one of the ways my students can work on their motor skills. The activity mats, toss and catch play set, and balancing spoon game are also ways to promote skills development while also teaching them cooperative play. These hands-on active play resources will help my students gain the practice they need not only through the school year, but also while attending summer school. Additionally, my students will also be learning new vocabulary, practicing math skills, and learning some science concepts. By having these additional opportunities to learn these academic skills, my students will begin to generalize the concepts and learn that language, math, and science can be done outside while having fun in the sun! As a first year Special Education teacher, my goal is to provide my students with the necessary skills to learn at their individual levels, while introducing functional concepts. The best way to accomplish this is to provide a variety of learning opportunities in multiple learning modalities. That is why this project is important to me. Your donation will help me expand our functional curriculum to the outdoors and that will not only benefit my students this year, but in years to come. Thank-you.

The touch screen facilitates easy use for tiny fingers still developing fine motor skills. The highly visual and animated delivery of iPad educational apps captures their imagination, motivates their desire to learn, and provides the authentic use of technology to master essential knowledge and skills. We are requesting three iPads. One of our teachers previously received an iPad through a grant. If this Donors Choose project is funded, the iPads will be placed permanently in each classroom. The use of the iPads will offer a plethora of appealing, hands-on learning experiences that will facilitate the mastery of kindergarten skills. The iPads will be utilized by independent student use in literacy and math stations. Students could use Tellagami, Videolicious, or Puppet Pals app to retell or create their own fairy tale. Another possibility would be to use Educreations app to describe the plant cycle or their animal research. Haiku Deck could be used to show their learning about landforms or science tools. The possibilities are endless! We want to provide a technology tool that will appeal to our 21st century learners, enhance instruction, and increase student learning.

I try to keep some interesting art books and magazines on hand in the class room for them. They really seem to enjoy reading about artists and styles of art from short magazine articles. The student examples in the Scholastic Magazines seem to inspire them to try harder and learn more. Sadly, the magazines that I do have are mostly out dated hand me downs that are tattered and falling apart. My students need Scholastic Art Magazines for the 2014-2015 school year. The new subscription of Scholastic Art Magazine that we are asking for would be so motivating for my students. They are getting tired of seeing the same old magazines year after year.

Remember how proud of that earthly achievement you were? But what if you had no place to sit and observe this seed's journey? The students at Cicely Tyson School are all very dedicated to their garden. It was a completely new experience for these children since they live in a very dense city where safe parks, and green areas are hard to come by. When the children are at school, they are surrounded by daily joys, happy faces and lots of learning, but when they leave the building there are few places to enjoy the outdoors, let alone observe and learn in the garden they worked so hard to create. They are extremely proud of this particular space, which is home to many vegetables, and herbs, which will return again this spring! These students are so committed to the garden that they even take turns arriving at 6:00 am over the summer to care for the garden before the heat of the sun arrives. They are looking forward to having a place to sit so that they can spend more meaningful time in the schoolyard garden. These happy gardeners range in age from 5 to12 years old, and each play an important role! These benches will be used daily from Spring to Summer, and all throughout the fall. In the event of a mild winter, they can enjoy the wonders of winter and make use of the benches then as well. The main purpose of the benches will be to offer a place to sit while making notes in growth charts, seedling transfers, and general maintenance of the garden. Students will also have access to the benches during science, language arts, and visual arts where they can sit and enjoy a lesson with hands on experience and opportunity. The impact of learning from hands on experience in the garden is priceless. There have been countless studies that have noted this particular value, and it is my goal to provide this experience for my students in the most effective way. Although our garden is on its way, it is truly not ready for serious learning if the children must sit in an uncomfortable manner. Having convertible benches will provide a place to write and learn in its proper way. The lives of my students' will greatly be impacted by this donation!

I teach reading and social studies to two groups of very active 3rd graders that are at different levels academically. At any given moment throughout the day you can find some of them standing up doing their work, sitting on their feet, rocking, or tipping back in their chairs. While doing these things, some are focused and doing their work, but many are focused on something else. I am requesting 3 pink limited edition Susan G. Komen for the Cure 18' Hokki Stools to help the more active students in my class to sit and focus. These stools will join the stools we already have, allowing more students to sit on them during the day and in small group during our guided reading period. The wonderful difference with these stools compared to the stools that we already have is that they are Susan G. Komen for the Cure pink stools. A portion of the sales from each stool will go to assist with saving lives and ending breast cancer.

e4ad76140432bb59d306629e9e4f8cb4,Our Journey with Sassy Simone Sandford- Book Series Study,"My students were all able to read Book 1 of the Sassy series by Sharon Draper. Each child had a copy of the book while I read aloud to them. Every single student was engaged! Day by day they anticipated what will happen next. Students also created a 'Sassy Journal' exploring point of view. My students are third graders with a real passion for hands-on learning through books. When reading aloud to them I see the sparkle in their eyes, but I also see them more engaged if they also have a copy of the book I am reading. It is often difficult to keep their attention for long periods of time. This, however, is NOT the case when it comes Sharon Draper's book 'Sassy-Little Sister is not my name!' This was one of the most rewarding times I spent with my students with a chapter book. There were chapter questions for each chapter where students had to revisit the chapter to answer. There were opportunities for creativity when students wrote in the character's point of view. After we finished book 1, the students said, 'This was the best book ever! Are we reading book 2-4?' Our school is comprised of all of the third and fourth graders in our district. We are located in a low-income area with a high rate of students receiving free or reduced lunch. My students will use the classroom sets of the chapter book series of 'Sassy,' by author Sharon M. Draper, during our reading block. During this time we sit in a 'U' shape with our desks and engage ourselves in book discussions for every chapter. We will answer questions created that are Common Core driven. Creativity will be involved, as they create their 'Sassy' journals, and students will be able to each have a copy where they will be able to work in literature circles with their peers. The book will also serve as a resource if students need to review the text for an activity or lesson involving the book. The students will be able to learn about writing point of view from a chapter book. The students will also be able to better understand a book through well thought out questions; based on the chapters and created by the Sharon Draper website. After reading the 1st book my students are truly becoming anxious in reading more chapter books. Donations to this project will improve my classroom as it will allow students to have a joyful experience with the love of reading chapter books. My students were at first hesitant to read chapter books. However, reading aloud with everyone having a copy impacted my highest reader to my lowest reader in my class. Everyone was engaged. I think that finishing a series with such an impacting character that the students lov, would influence them to read more chapter book series independently.

Technology in the classroom has made an incredible difference in my ability to meet the needs of my individual students. The development of STEM proficient students begins in elementary school as students explore increasingly complex concepts in math, science, engineering, and technology. One goal of STEM education is to engage students in a variety of learning activities that require them to understand and address real life issues and challenges.

It is my responsibility to equip them with the skills they will need to be successful, not just in the next grade, but in life. To achieve this, my students need to become logical and critical thinkers, experts at collaboration, and effective communicators. STEM activities are the perfect vehicle.

My 2nd grade students are eager learners who reside in a low-income, culturally diverse suburban community. At least 75% of the students in the school are on free or reduced lunch. Many families struggle to make ends meet. As a result, they have limited funds to provide resources in the home such as books and the Internet. Additionally, many families have never been more than a few miles outside the community. The outcome is that our students do not have the background knowledge or opportunity to learn about the world and how it is shaped by current events.

We have the highest rate of ELL (English language learners) in the state and have a high amount of special education students. Even with all of these facts against my students they love school! They want to learn and come in each day eager to work hard! Since we have had the great opportunity through Donorschoose to add technology into our classroom I have seen my students excel. We are so lucky to have five iPads that each of my students now and in the future will be able to use and learn on. My ultimate goal is to get technology into the hands of each student. This is a huge challenge but I know it can be accomplished! With an iPad my students are able to work on reading, writing, science and social studies. At first I thought we would mostly use the iPad for math and reading but since receiving them we have been able to do science projects with the help of the iPad and social studies reports! WOW! Amazing what technology has brought to my classroom! I also use the iPad as a behavior reward. If a child has a good day he/she can earn time on the iPad. This has worked really well!This iPad will help my students work on the newest technology and will give each of them life skills they need to succeed.

Reflecting on the words of Aristotle, in order to ensure that we have repeated excellence, we need to get the basics of organization! I want to start our third year stronger than ever, not scrambling for basic supplies. My students are the hardest working students around! They love basketball, singing, dancing and seeing their progress grow! They love to be organized, but have some trouble in the details (like when our staplers break because they've been used to death for so long, or having only one hole puncher for our whole class). While they are the most incredible young minds, there are many difficulties inherent in being a rural, Title I, 100% poverty school that can distract us from the real effort of learning and growing. Help me afford to get these basics of organization taken care of to alleviate our organizing woes! In our third year in Ms. G's room, I envision a seamlessly organized classroom. Each student will have their own tray, which will be used to store binders in class and to hand out any work for that day. The bright paper and ink will be used for creating permanent reference sheets, and the staplers and hole puncher will ensure we have no problem staying organized! Again, excellence is not an act but a habit, and staying organized will help us get there! This project will help us start the 2014-2015 school year strong with consistent routines and structures that will enable the greatest growth and success yet! As all teachers know, without structure, nothing else happens so I cannot wait to solidify what we have in place. Having these organizational and note-keeping tools will change my students' lives as they realize that excellence truly is a habit, failing to plan for success is planning to fail, and to grow, we must first plant some seeds!

Currently they are not ALL able to use their iPads to the fullest learning potential. I teach 16 bright third grade students. I teach in a school district where 54% are economically disadvantaged. Last year our technology department was able to move funds around and provided our entire third grade with iPads. These iPads have made huge gains for our classrooms in reading, math, computer science skills, and much more! Our third grade students are so grateful for the opportunity to have iPads in our classrooms, but we have found situations where keypads to go with our iPads are much needed. We use a computer skill learning program and it would be very beneficial to have keyboards to use it. In third grade we also create a lot of projects using PowerPoint and Word. These projects can be created on the iPads, but would be created much easier if we had keyboards. Also, next year our third grade students will take the Smarter Balanced Assessment and keyboards will make test taking much smoother. With our iPads we don't want our students to lose out on typing and we want to make use of our iPads the best we can. Currently we have received nine keyboards through Donors Choose and outside funding. My students use these nine any chance they get. We would like to add these six to get close to completing our classroom set. Receiving our iPads was a dream come true for our students. Having a classroom set of keyboards for our iPads would be like icing on their dream! These keyboards will allow my students to do everything they want and need to do on their iPads.

Their imaginations are like most kindergartners with one exception - most will NOT get an opportunity to vacation in exotic places until they become adults and even then, the opportunity might not be afforded to them. My students have an appetite for adventure and long to visit far away places that are found on our frayed continent carpet and in the books that are read to them. It is my desire to give them a sense of community and ownership of personal space when we have reading time and lessons on the carpet. My students are part of a K-8 Center with multicultural languages and cultures. Therefore, the appeal for materials to peak the interest and enlighten students of other cultures is always present. We pride ourselves in exploring the diverse differences found within the various cultures in our school. These students will have a special spot or country to identify when coming to the carpet for read-aloud, morning and/or afternoon sessions, and any other lessons which will take place in the carpet area. They will learn about being a community of learners who respect others and take responsibility of their respective country or spot. What a joy it would be for them to sing one of their favorite songs on the new carpet: CONTINENTS by Ron BrownPull out the map and what do you seeSeven chunks of the land, what can they be?Africa, Asia, Antarctica, when you get to Australia there's a kangaroo, andTwo Americas - North and SouthWhen you get to Europe - Open your mouth!The continents, con-tin-ents, con-tin-ents, the continents. By following the song, the students will jump on the location of each continent as they sing along. This would implant the continents into their psychic for future class participation. Each student will be assigned a country/flag from the carpet. They will take ownership of the country, explore the tastes, customs, apparels, and sounds of their individual country. This will enlighten them of the differences in cultures and those things which are alike in human beings. In addition, they will learn how to be respectful, responsible, and safe in the classroom and how it is a privilege to sit on the carpet and participate as a classroom community of learners.

My class of six-year old and seven-year old students live in a close-knit, low-income neighborhood. Many of their parents also attended our school. They love to learn but many face hardships at home; including parents who are incarcerated, one parent homes, and parents who fight often in front of them. Many of my students come to school to escape difficulties at home. School is their bridge to success. I see myself not only as a teacher of content but a role model for what one can achieve through hard work and perseverance. I try to open their minds to what awaits them in the world and what possibilities their futures can hold. Learning to read can be a daunting task. Students need many experiences with reading books and other materials. These durable book holders will allow my students a special place to keep the books they are reading. Now, their books often get pushed into their desks, sometimes damaging the book, or fall out onto the floor. My students love to read so they try to hold onto several books at once. These book holders will allow them to more easily see the books they have chosen and which ones they want to return to our classroom library. They can carry the book holders with them when looking for a cozy place to read. These durable book holders will benefit my current students, as well as all of my future students.

My pre-k students are four and five year olds who attend a public school in Texas with a high poverty rate. My students are either from families below the line of poverty or English as a second language learners. My students have a love for school, where they have many new experiences such as painting, puzzles, singing, and and listening to books. They are like sponges absorbing knowledge very quickly, and I am privileged to be a part of their growth! My students need books for read alouds to match our thematic units. Reading aloud to my students is one of the best ways that I can build their vocabularies. Especially with my English as second language learners, developing vocabulary is one of my biggest goals of the year. Our pre-k curriculum is organized by thematic units, so these books will provide additional read aloud opportunities that fit into our themes. The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book is an excellent way to teach and review upper case and lower case letters. The copies of Five Little Ducks will allow my students to hold their own copy of the book while they listen to the audio book. After I read the books aloud, all of the books in this project will be placed in my library center, where my students can re-read the books and re-tell the story. They will follow up their comprehension by drawing a picture of the stories in their journal. These books will be used for many years and impact many students! Having quality children's literature to read aloud to my pre-k students will develop their vocabularies with words that they will remember and use for their entire life! My hope is to develop a class full of children who love books and reading and who will never stop reading!

Do you remember learning history in school, using only a boring textbook? Well I sure do! Even today we still have the textbook! The textbook is great, but we need more! We are requesting a subscription to Cicero Kids. This subscription will allow my students to have hands-on, interactive access to learning history. Students today are 21st Century Learners and having access to Cicero Kids will enhance their learning and will make them eager to learn more. We will use this interactive site to learn more about the history required in our standards. Not only will we be learning history, but Cicero Kids is cross curricular and it supports other areas of education such as reading, language arts, math, etc. My students will gain a wealth of knowledge through this resource in a fun and engaging way.

If so, it's probably because you felt like you were memorizing information about dates, places, and people that didn't seem real. I don't want my students to feel that way about history. Students in our school include military dependents, English language learners, students with disabilities, gifted learners, and talented artists. They are all full of energy and curiosity. They want to understand what they study, rather than memorizing facts. My goal is to make learning fun and meaningful for them through interactive lessons. I believe that is the key to helping children develop a lifelong love of learning. CICERO Kids is a digital curriculum that would be an excellent way to help teach my students about our nation's history. Pictures, videos, music, maps, and timelines will make the content more meaningful because it will help my students visualize and understand historical events and their causes. The interactive games will keep my students interested and help them build and demonstrate knowledge. Since literacy, science, math, and character education are included in the lessons on CICERO Kids my students will build skills in other content areas as they learn history. As an added bonus, CICERO Kids can be accessed on any device with an Internet connection. That means it will be available to them at school, home, and on the go. Learning can happen any time, any place. Please consider supporting this project. It will help my students meet grade level standards in multiple subject areas while building a stronger foundation for their academic careers.

When my students see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know the next art project. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We have academic clubs after school, and daily pull-out academic programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. The pliers requested will be used by me to cut wire for my students painted sculptures. My students will bend and shape the wire into amorphic shapes and place on plastic sheet pocket protectors needed. They will take the window art paint needed to create colorful designs of lines, shapes, and patterns inside the wire. Once the paint dries, the students will peel off the plastic and form sculptures by bending and manipulating the pliable paint into 3-dimensional sculptures inspired by the famous artist Chiuly. This is an exciting, unique 3-dimensional project that I would also like to display in the library to generate art awareness an the importance to keep the arts in the public schools. Students will learn from the video needed that Chiuly has created glass blown art that is organically part of of nature. They will observe that he has colorful art installations around the world of glass blown art combining art, water, nature, flowers, and tress. Through the video and classroom discussion of Chiuly's work, my students will learn the importance of collaborating and sharing, leads to positive outcomes in the arts and life. They will learn that Chiuly is blind in one eye an is still able to create beautiful glass blown art by collaborating too. Many of my art students have not even been to a museum.

I teach a 4th/5th grade combination class. My students come from a high poverty neighborhood where more than 75% of them receive free or reduced-price lunch. There are a very diverse range of home structures: nuclear, single parent, multiple-family, foster, migrant, and military, to name a few. Our students also come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, with a large portion being Hispanic, Punjabi and African American. Additionally, we have a large population of English Language Learners. With such diversity, it is to be expected that each student is going to have a very divergent range of personal, social, emotional, and educational needs when compared to schools that serve a more homogeneous population. As a class we will be reading 'The One and Only Ivan', a story about a captured gorilla who befriends a captured baby elephant. My students will then be researching and learning more about endangered animals using the books requested. The students will be split up into groups and focus their research on one habitat and the endangered animals that live in it. During their research, the students will be using the scissors, glue sticks, and colored pens to record their information into their interactive journals. At the end of the research, each group will create presentations about the endangered species in their habitat and what we can do to help save the animals. The goal of this project is for students to share this information throughout the school and raise awareness of the animals on the endangered species list and share ways in which we can help. This project will engage and teach students through the high-interest class read, along with the other high-interest non-fiction books. Students will not only be learning about regular school topics, but they will learn how to make a difference in the world by learning about how to help and save endangered species. Life skills are embedded throughout this project as students use their research skills to figure out a way to solve a problem and take a stand for something they believe in.

As a primary teacher most of my day is spent guided their learning in the area of English language arts. Guided reading is the best way to facilitate literacy skills. My students live in area of high poverty in northern New Jersey. More than half of my students qualify for free or reduced lunch. They all receive free breakfast. They are very hard working and their families are extremely supportive despite their economic shortcomings. My students all have an overwhelming desire to learn and want to make the most of their time in my class. Guided reading is small group instruction in which the teacher 'guides' students through a text that is at the children's instructional reading level. The role of the teacher is crucial in guided reading. Guided reading is planned, focused instruction. The ultimate goal is to foster independent readers. Because of the overcrowding in some classrooms, I will be transforming my current reading table to accommodate more students as desks. I need a horseshoe table that sole purpose is for guided reading. Without this guided reading table, I will be unable to meet and facilitate with each student. This table will be used to run strategy groups with 6 students at a time in order to advance their literacy skills throughout the school year.

As a dedicated teacher, I want to provide my students with a way to keep their bodies and minds active without disrupting the learning of others. This year I am teaching in a single-gender classroom consisting of twenty boys of varying ability levels. Our elementary school is located in a small town in South Carolina. Although the students come from a variety of backgrounds, there is one common problem that many of my students face- the need for movement. Many of my students are very active and full of energy. They often find it hard to sit still and focus on their work. Because of this, they often disrupt the learning of other students around them. My students are very smart and capable of anything; many of them just need help focusing. Standing desks and stability balls just may be the solution to our problem! The stability balls will enable students to wiggle while they work! The students will be able to move around, yet it won't distract others who are working around them. Instead of focusing on sitting still, students can focus on their learning while improving their balance, posture, and strength. The stability balls will be used for small group instruction, group work, and just anytime a child feels like they need to use one in order to focus! Students will also have access to the standing desks anytime they feel like they'd rather stand up to work/listen rather than sit still in their desks. I want to encourage my students to move and stay active, not sit still, and these alternatives will help to achieve this goal. While my active students will reap many learning and health benefits from these stools, this product will also be beneficial to the students around them because the movement is not large enough to distract my teaching or the learning of the other students. This new furniture will help all students become better focused and my teaching become uninterrupted. In terms of health and academics, everyone will benefit from the addition of standing desks and stability balls into our classroom!

As a teacher, I realize the importance of starting the new school year off on the right track. I also realize that some of my new students may not have basic supplies when they enter my classroom. I believe that if I am able to provide them with basic supplies, they will start the year off motivated and excited about learning. I believe that I must start the year off by making learning visual and hands-on. This is important to me because I realize that children learn best when they are active rather than passive learners.

' -David Warlick My 2nd grade students attend an inner city public school that consists of low income families. Sadly, many of the students lack the resources and support to have technology experience at home. Despite their home environment they are very inquisitive and have a strong desire to learn. School is the only place that offers opportunities for students to explore, interact, experience and learn what their financially well off peers learn at such an earlier age. Unfortunately, with the lack of cuts and funding our schools are having difficulty providing the necessary provisions to help our students prepare and compete in the 21st century. My main goal is to increase students reading abilities, promote the love of books and provide a range of learning opportunities for students to understand and grasp concepts through the use of Kindle Fires. The use of Kindle Fires will offer my students opportunities for development and participation in fun and educational learning. This engagement will equip students to better understand concepts and help them independently organize their learning experiences according to their interests and the abilities. The Kindle offers access to reading, science, social studies and math applications for various learning levels. Our internet access will allow the students to research topics and participate in district lined assessments more efficiently. Students will work independently and in small groups to complete tasks and assessments. Your support for this project will help prepare students for a changing world.

My school is located in the urban South. Nearly all of the students come from low-income families, which makes us a Title I school, and nearly all are students of color. They are eager, curious children on the brink of adolescence, and they are passionate about issues of social justice, history, and multiculturalism. With these social-studies themed books, I will be able to help open up students to the world around them. Specifically, in fifth grade we study topics throughout US History, such as the Civil War, Civil Rights, immigration, and civics. We don't have a specific block of time in our schedule for social studies, so we will use these picture books not only to become better readers and writers, but to integrate many important social studies concepts into the curriculum. I believe that representing my diverse students' backgrounds in the curriculum is incredibly important. I want to read them books with characters who look like them and come from different countries like them, so that they can learn about the complex roots of American culture.

Due to the budget crunch, each teacher at my school has been allotted one hundred dollars for supplies. After ordering copy paper, binder paper and pencils, there's not a lot of money left for other items such as dry erase markers. With all of the work my students do on the white boards, we run out of dry erase marker within the first month of school. I call it 'The Competition.' Each pair of students gets a white board and a dry erase marker. I put problems on the overhead, they each work it out, write the answer on the white board, and then hold it up for me to quickly say, 'Correct or try again.' They then go on to the next problem as soon as they are finished. They are very competitive and work hard at doing as many problems as possible. It is amazing to see all of my students working and working fast. I know it's because they get to write it down on a white board, and they quickly find out if they are right. I am also able to easily see who is not getting it and help them right away instead of waiting to see what they don't get on the test. The more work they do, the more they will learn.

I learned to read at age three, and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in Mississippi.' My students come from impoverished homes where survival is priority. When my 5 and 6 years old walk into school most of them have never listened to a story or even seen a book. What parents do, or do not do, has a lasting impact on their child's reading skill and literacy. As a kindergarten teacher in an urban district, I have several challenges I must overcome in order for my students to not only learn how to read, but love to read. Books can be my student's pass to personal freedom and inspiration to change their life. My students deserve the very best. Unfortunately, our school's budget is unable to afford the resources our students need and deserve. Help my eager and loving learners reach their greatest potential! Hearing a book read on tape helps children see how the words on the page can come alive in a fluid, expressive way. It helps them focus on the sounds of words read without interruption and provides a model of fluent reading. Audio books also give children an important introduction to listening--a skill that he/she must master in order to learn to read. I plan to set up a listening center so that four children can listen to the same book at the same time. This can provide a wonderful opportunity for children to hear their favorite books read aloud again and again. The more they listen, the greater the likelihood that they will learn new vocabulary words. And, when listening with a special friend, the opportunities for playing creatively and acting out parts of the story are endless. This will be an invaluable addition to our learning centers! Many books on tape have interesting sound effects, music, and multiple narrators that are especially motivating and fun for young children. Narrators on tape tend to embellish their storytelling with silly voices and dramatic enhancements. They emphasize reading as a source of pleasure rather than a skill, and make children eager to learn how to read. Your generous donation will be a gift that will keep on giving!

Unfortunately, these instruments have been around for a while, and the care, cleaning and maintenance supplies are long gone.

Throughout the summer, you still keep an eye on it, and make sure that everything is set for a smooth ride. The same is true for instruments. They must be cleaned and oiled/greased in order to be in good playing condition. When corks dry and crack, you cannot put or keep a clarinet together. When valves and slides are dry, it creates friction and resistance, which results in no music.

Though a majority of my students are from a low socio-economic background, they are charged with enthusiasm for learning and interacting with new materials. Unfortunately, for most of them the only opportunity for this exposure is during the time they spend in school. These children depend on us to provide them with all they need to be well equipped for the world. Many of my students come from homes where either the parents do not speak English, work multiple jobs to make ends meet, or are just not involved in their children's lives. They have the hunger to learn and for these precious children an good education is their ticket out of their low economic barrier. They deserve to have the chance to turn their lives around. So when they come to school, I want to do my best to make sure they are well taken care of and that I have done everything in my power to ensure a love for learning. My students need 25 subscriptions to Scholastic StoryWorks Magazine to enhance their literary experience. These magazines have been highly recommended. I have used Scholastic Magazines in my classroom for years. Last year a colleague introduced me to StoryWorks. I was able to visit her classroom and see how she uses it with her students. I was impressed with how the students were engaged, interacted with the magazine and how they used it to collaborate in group discussions. The teacher used the issue as a starting point for individualized units of study. Watching her and her students interact and feeling the energy in the room that this magazine created gave me the motivation I needed to introduce it in my own classroom. Each subscription is centered around one essential question for students to explore. It includes 10 different genres, including poetry, interviews, and debates, just to name a few. The subscriptions also comes a digital component, allowing me to incorporate technology into the exploration of topics. Students will also be able to take these magazines home use them for homework assignments and share the information. As a teacher I know that StoryWorks will allow me to provide students with texts that are exciting to read in whole group, by themselves, or with a buddy. The variety of literature that StoryWorks provides allows students to explore beyond their borders. Unfortunately, I was not able to get this ordered through my school, but with your help my students will have a great addition to their reading selection. They will be able to have literature that can learn from and be enjoyable. ",My students need 25 subscriptions to Scholastic StoryWorks Magazine to enhance their literary experience.

The majority of our students live well below the national poverty level. Many of our families earn their living from the Gulf of Mexico, which has been slowly bouncing back from numerous unfortunate circumstances....and while we do see the recovery, many of our families and students still have a difficult time buying the basic essentials needed to make the most of their elementary school years! I am requesting several different items that we use on a daily basis: Elmer's Liquid Glue, Glue Sticks, Fiskars Scissors, Crayola Colored Pencils, Pens, Cap Erasers, and Post-it-Notes. These are our most basic supplies, and while they are not very expensive items by themselves, keeping all of them adequately replenished for an entire classroom of children is! I am also requesting basic good hygiene supplies: Liquid Hand Soap, Kleenex, and Clorox Wipes..... We need these because cold and flu season is just around the corner and we have to keep our students healthy and in school in order for them to be successful....

This upcoming school year will begin my fifth year as a special education teacher at the early childhood level. I will be teaching 25 students in an integrated kindergarten classroom. This means I will be working alongside with a general education teacher to teach students with varying abilities and academic goals. Our school is Title I funded and we have a large population of students who come from homes that speak a language other then English. My students love listening to stories at the meeting area and writing stories about animals and insects. The disabilities affecting my students include speech impairment, learning disabled, emotionally disturbed and autism. I am requesting an assortment of basic classroom supplies to help get our classroom running for the upcoming school year. I am requesting assorted tags to create bus tags for students' backpacks, staples, stapler remover, different tape for student work, pens, special markers for flip charts, book rings for students' work and basic classroom office supplies. In kindergarten, we create a lot of our very own books to publish. We use a lot of tape to piece some of our pictures together and display them throughout the classroom. We love to display our student work for visitors to see! This project will make sure we have enough book rings to piece together our writing projects and enough staples in our writing center so that young writers can make as many writing booklets as they want! We are not provided with the funds to purchase the everyday basic school supplies we need to begin the school year.

Some students come with supplies, but many can't afford school supplies. Imagine being one of the many student who cannot afford the school supplies. My students are very excited and motivated to learn. The supplies that they do come with seem to break easily or do not last a school year. However, many of the students cannot afford the school supplies that they need, and they have to borrow or watch the others who do have supplies. Our school has about a 75% poverty level. The supplies we are asking for are very important to my students' learning. The post-it notes are wonderful for my students to take notes on while they are reading. The colored pens are perfect for my students to have at their fingertips while completing their thinking maps. The take-home folders are a nice addition for taking home their papers and notes so they don't lose their papers. The lined paper is greatly need for my students to complete much of their work. With all the state cutbacks in education, receiving grants from generous organizations is in great need for our classroom to continue to teach our students. This project is important so that the students have the supplies needed for day-to-day activities. All students will have the same supplies and no one will feel left out. We are asking for lined paper, colored copy paper, sticky notes, take-home folders and pens. Please consider donating to my classroom's project as it will really help the students that will be in my class next year. This will allow all of the students to start off on equal ground for their education. This will also allow me, as a teacher, to supply my class with the classroom work that they need to further their education.

What if you did not have access to your own printer? First, my students are amazing. They are resilient, hard working, enthusiastic, and they love to learn. Most of them come from an undeserved community-- high poverty, violent neighborhoods, and a lack of access to technology and computers. Our school is a Title 1 school in North Charleston, SC, and it is truly a wonderful place to learn and teach. In our Personal Mastery classroom, we set high expectations of independent learning, and students practice solving problems themselves. This process is slowed when, I, the teacher, have to be in control of what is printed (papers, projects, research articles, etc). Our goal is be as paperless as possible without putting kinks in a student's personal learning experience. So- students will use this paper and ink in the STUDENT ONLY printer station. If they need to print an article and annotate, this is where they can do that. If they need to print a paper or creative piece of writing for editing, they have a space to do so (without having to ask me for help). I have a printer. My students need paper and ink to go with it. This STUDENT ONLY printer station will allow students to practice and strengthen independent problem solving skills. It will give them more control over their learning, reading, and writing.

We just need to find our medium and style. The majority of my students have never even touched clay before. My aim is to widen their horizon with another medium to work with and help them find their artistic style I consider myself lucky because I get to teach all of the students in my school. Our students range from 4K to 5th grade, and we also have two wonderful Autism spectrum classes, which are split by grade level. Though it is a small school, we have a lot of diversity which makes for a fun, well-rounded educational setting. The students hold a wide array of interests and hobbies. Each child has a distinct personality which really shines through in each work of art they create. I love watching them work and use creative problem solving to fit their own style and ideas into the artwork they are working on. I am so inspired every day watching them work. I personally feel that my students and I are very fortunate, because though we may not have a large budget, we have a school that shares my philosophy that each child has their own unique style and should be allowed to express that. Each child is taught the same techniques and materials, but are allowed to interpret it in their own way. The exact artwork they will be creating will vary by grade level, but I want my students to build their fine motor skills and learn the three basic hand building techniques: pinching, coiling, and slabs. The upper grades will learn to score and slip as well. I will also be focusing on mosaics with 5th grade and we will be creating a collaborative mosaic on a wall in the garden outside of the Art Room. For every grade level, I will also be teaching about functionality of artwork. This is where the glaze is important. I want the students to understand that glaze isn't just for decoration, it also serves a purpose. It is the reason that they are able to eat and drink out of the clay cups and bowls they make in class. The Art Teacher before me left behind a kiln and a wonderful set of clay tools, but we have no clay or glaze to work with. The little budget I have is not enough to cover the cost of theses materials. The materials would mean the world to my students and me! Building with your hands is a very empowering experience. I want for my students to have the opportunity to build their fine motor skills and express themselves in a completely new and different way than they ever have before.

Research shows that integrating movement and music into the daily routine is a highly effective method of achieving learning for children from high poverty. My students are happy children who feel safe, and excited to come to school. Our school is the heart of our community. Each child is greeted in the morning by name as he or she enters the school. Our school is, for many of them, their place of peace. My students have big hopes and dreams for their futures and want to learn. Each child in my class feels valued and important. They count on me to deliver lessons that challenge them as individuals - and as a team. I work hard to ensure that all my students are working at their own ability level. If you were to visit our classroom, you would see how music and movement is used seamlessly throughout our day. My students and I use music for the purpose of unifying and building community, as well as for teaching and learning.

With the Ipod Touch and JBL speaker system, that valuable time is spared and student time is used effectively! Kindergarteners love exploring and enjoy sharing their knowledge with others. In addition to the ability to play music, other features of the Ipod Touch will enable my students to practice and grow by: capturing pictures of their work, recording themselves practicing their reading, and researching topics via the Internet. I am excited to think they would be able to use such an empowering piece of equipment! This Ipod Touch and JBL docking station will allow me to create playlists that can be easily accessed and rapidly available to be used in teaching: math, reading, writing, letter shapes, science, social studies, OT, and for having FUN!

They love saying 'hello' from different parts of the world. One of my challenges is to teach them about the world around them. This is one of many ways I teach multiculturalism. My students are bright five-year-olds. They love school and they love to learn. Often at my school I have to gather resources on my own to make the learning fun and relevant, but it is so worth it. When I see how engaged my students are in the learning, it's priceless. My school is in a low income community. All of the students qualify for free lunch. Many of my students live in the neighborhood. They consider the school, 'their school' and they absolutely love being there. My students and their parents know how important learning and being college and career ready is. At any point, you could come in my room and ask, 'What's more important than learning?' and they will reply, 'Nothing!' Another catch-phrase I say to them is, ' We're getting the knowledge..' and they respond, 'to go to college.' Beginning in Kindergarten, I want my students to already have the mindset they are going to college. I want them to learn about not just their community, but the World Community. These magazines are for kindergarten learners. These magazines allow my students to learn about the world around them in a fun, colorful, and inquisitive way. Two of the magazines infuse the learning around social studies topics that are engaging and current events. The science magazine will pique the interest of those little scientists in my classroom and nourish those inquisitive minds. My students will be able to read most of the magazine on their own. They will participate in group talks about what they have learned and ask questions about the information they read to their peers. What amazing book talks they could have around this nonfiction reading material. These magazines also teach map skills, geography, math, phonics, and many comprehension strategies. Funding this project will allow me to teach my students about the world around them using colorful, kid-friendly, and inviting photographs. They will see students the same age as them, in different parts of the world, learning, living, and growing.

They come in every day with a smile, a positive attitude, and do everything they can to be successful in school! My class last year was particularly fond of all Mo Willem's books. I could not get ahold of enough of these books to get their reading appetites satisfied. To say they were obsessed is an understatement. There were rarely any available in our library because they always checked them out. They knew exactly where to go to find them on the shelf. Most of these kids had come in not knowing who Mo Willems was. Throughout the year they had formed an obsession and wanted to be just like him. This led to some amazing opportunities for my kids. We did author studies and studied his writing style as well as his illustrations. The children created their own books in Willems style. The books also served as great read-alouds and gave the children so many opportunities to practice emotions and voice when reading.

Their parents are not literate in English and many families lack the resources to help their child succeed. School becomes a safe haven and miracle location for my students to have a safe and encouraging environment to expand their constantly growing minds. I do my best to provide my students with all of the resources they need but at times cannot provide as well as I wish I could. My students deserve the very best that our school can offer to make them successful learners! My students need eight sets of headphones, 40 journals and a case of paper to improve literacy and writing skills. Journals- These journals will provide my students the chance to complete a daily journal writing on a topic of the students choice. This will allow them to apply the writing skills that they learned in an authentic writing piece. The design of these journals will allow the students the opportunity to illustrate their journal entry as well as demonstrates how their skills have developed over time. Stamp- This stamp will allow me to stamp the students journals each day to record the date of their journal entries/ Headphones- With two classroom computers and a listening center, headphones will allow my students to listen to stories and to participate in educational technology resources and stay focused without interrupting the education of the other students. Paper- Paper will allow me to print enrichment and intervention materials to assist my students in learning. It will help me to provide them with worksheets and homework assignments to practice the skills that I teach them. This project will improve my classroom by giving my students the resources they need to be successful students. These materials will allow them the opportunity to grow as learners and to have all necessary resources available at their fingertips. Reading and writing is so important for students to learn and this project will help my students to become successful readers and writers.

In 9th and 10th grade English, I'm pushing them to express themselves, explore their ideas, and learn more about themselves through their writing. To do this, they need to have one place to keep all of their thoughts - a comp book. My students are amazing. They come from all over the world, and have experienced more than I can imagine. They have powerful stories to tell, and in my class, I'm trying to help them find their voices. They are funny, insightful, and more worldly than I ever was when I was their age. But they also have a lot working against them - many are migrants or refugees; most are low-income; our building lacks some of the basic necessities. We talk a lot about the adversity we experience and see, and how that makes us who we are. My goal as their language arts teacher is to help them find out more about who they are, what they've experienced, and how their stories can change those around them. It's daunting for all of us, but exciting when a student realizes that she isn't just doing a writing assignment, but instead is telling something personal and teaching me about her. We use comp books as a 'writers' notebook.' This is a space that's entirely the student's: it's personalized, and will end up holding all of the work that they'll do for the whole year. At times I'll ask them to write very specific things; other times, it will be a space dedicated to free writes, opinions, ideas, and reservations. A writer's notebook is critical for writers, regardless of their level, and we want our students to start embracing their identities as writers early on. Therefore I am asking for composition notebooks, folders in which to store the books, and pencils for writing.A writer's notebook is critical for writers, regardless of their level, and we want our students to start embracing their identities as writers early on.

Both groups of students will be striving to stay on green, to earn a trip to the treasure box. This means we will need lots and lots of treasure box rewards!

4b42871a81be25fbff78c16d84afeb77,The Value of Curiosity and Choice Chambers,"As I embark on my second year of teaching high school science, I am filled with excitement, anticipation, and a sense that I carry a heavy burden. Since many of my students will have me as their science teacher for three to four years in a row, I am solely responsible for their opinion of science. I teach at a small school in a rural agricultural community burdened with poverty. Our students grow up in single-parent homes with more mouths to feed than food on the table. Education is not valued, and it seems as if our students cannot imagine a reality in which they do not rely on government support. They are the victims of generational poverty, and my fellow educators and I are tasked with teaching them how to become productive citizens and break that cycle. As a science teacher, I feel like my role is to teach students how to ask relevant questions and determine how to answer those questions. One of the biggest themes of my classes is the importance of inquiry. Curiosity has been a major catalyst for scientific discovery, and I like to foster curiosity by allowing my students to design and carryout their own experiments. One type of experiment students can easily relate to is animal behavior. A choice chamber allows students to present an organism with several different choices and determine their preferences. For example, my students may collect pill bugs and determine what roll they play in an ecosystem by figuring out what they like to eat. When students ask their own question, design their experiment, then seek to answer that question, they are not only learning about science, they are becoming scientists. Students will then record their experimental process, show their data analysis, and present it to the class using the chart paper. Students become more confident and capable as they present their experiments throughout the year. When we celebrate curiosity and let students know they have a voice, an important opinion, we build up their self worth. When we equip students to identify relevant questions, use the scientific process to answer those questions, and confidently share their findings with their peers, we are promoting ownership and responsibility. I hope these skills and traits will help our students solve real world problems when they're no longer in the classroom.

c317d493ad9814e7a840785ab4cbbbd3,Inner-City Puppet Theater,"Our art room houses several iterations of visual art. 1st and 2nd hour is usually basic Art 1 and 2. 3rd hour is usually Video Production. By 4th hour we are either doing Digital Photography, Graphic Design or Art Appreciation/Art History. 7th hour is the new and experimental Puppet Making class. My students are from Flint, MI and the surrounding counties. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. Many of my students come from poverty stricken areas and households. This is the single factor that most of my students have in common. We are about 85% free and reduced lunches. Many come from violent environments, broken and unstable home environments. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. Students who are openly homosexual, pregnant, extremely intelligent, or socially awkward make up a large portion of the student body. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to extremely empathetic to others. We pride ourselves in being involved in our community! The two items I am requesting are specifically for our new puppet theater that we are starting this year. We will be producing both indoor and outdoor productions. The puppets will range in size from 3 feet to parade style puppets which are sometimes up to 20 feet. Our first show will be this December. It is about dreams. The show will combine live puppetry, shadow puppetry, video, live music, recorded music, lighting, sound design, narration and a smoke machine I hope! Our main puppets are in the style of Japanese Bunraku puppets as well as European Marionette Portee style puppets. This means that the puppets are very high in artistic style and creativity. These are not Muppet style. Most of the puppets will take 3 students to operate. One for the head and arm, one for the back and other arm and one for the legs. Since we will be utilizing video and overhead projections as well as live music, narration and sound effects we are in desperate need of a movie screen and a sound system. Our intention is for our students to be able to tell stories relevant to their lives. Puppets are a great way for our particular student body to express themselves in a unique way. Controlling a puppet also takes some of the stigma of performance away from an otherwise nervous young actor. Helping to support our Puppet Theater will directly impact the lives of hundreds of inner-city youth and their families but also the wider Flint community.

My 60+ third graders attend a Title I (low socioeconomic) school in Texas. We have a wide range of students, including those who come from middle class families to those whose parents struggle to make ends meet. Despite their diversity, ALL of my students are inquisitive learners and hard workers. As their math teacher, I love working with them and watching them discover how mathematics is an integral part of their everyday life. We received a printer through donorschoose.org last year, but printers require ink. And with the new school year here, we are in need of more ink! Having ink means that I can print colorful foldables and anchor charts for my students' interactive math notebooks. I can also create more activities and games for Math Workshop. We are also in need of a VGA Manual Switch Box. We received an iPad stand through donorschoose.org last year as well, which has allowed me, the teacher, to use my district-provided iPad as a document camera. That has been a huge help in the classroom, allowing all of my students to see the lesson for the day. Currently, to switch back and forth between the iPad and computer when using the projector, I am constantly unplugging and plugging back in. Not only is it a waste of class time, but it often messes up the display--sometimes not working at all! Having the VGA switch box would allow me to connect both pieces of technology without all of the mess. My classroom has been blessed by the generosity of the donorschoose.org community, and having received various resources has made a huge difference in both my teaching and my students' learning. What we are asking for now would allow us to continue to use what we already have in a more efficient and effective manner. I don't want my students to live in a black and white world in my classroom, and with your help, these supplies will help them see rainbows.

They love to read books on their own and they gain so much confidence in their reading ability when they can read a book by themselves. I would love to have a wide variety of books for them to choose from. This will help them gain more exposure to books and hopefully continue their growth in their reading ability.

These books are used for independent reading time in class. Independent reading time is a time frame where students are reading on their own, with a purpose. I conference with students independently and am able to discuss reading strategies with the students. By building the classroom library, students have more books to use during independent reading time and continue to grow as independent readers.

When all you want to do is put your left leg in and shake it all about? I teach first grade. It is difficult for a first grader to sit still for long periods of time. And let's face it, should a first grader really sit still for that long? Hokki stools provide constant movement while the student 'sits' to complete work or explore concepts. The movement of the stool promotes physical well-being and balance to encourage a healthy lifestyle. These stools also promote intellectual well-being as the constant movement helps students focus. My students need three Hokki stools to provide movement and promote health in terms of both intellectual and physical well-being. A hokki stool is designed to give the person sitting on it constant slight movement. This helps the child get the movement they need while sitting at their seat.

In total, our school consists of 810 students, 150 of which are in fourth grade. Half of the teachers on our seven person team teach math and science, while the other half teach reading and writing (our seventh teacher is self-contained, teaching all subjects). We are appreciative of the generous parents we have at our school, many of whom offer much of their time and support. Imagine a classroom where reading is a priority and giving time to read, lots of time to read, is carved into each day. Students in our classes spend at least 30 minutes per day reading books they select on their own and are interested in. Experts say that a classroom library should have enough books to equal at least 20 per student. Because we have seven classes of readers, this would mean that our fourth grade would need over 3,000 books between our four classroom libraries to truly meet the needs of our readers. Each week, our students select new books to read. These books need to be of high interest to them as well as on their level. Having access to a wide variety of appropriate level and high interest books will aid our students on their journey to becoming lifelong lovers of reading.

We have a very diverse group of learners in our district. Many of the students I work with have very little support from home and come to school seeking structure and a helping hand. When the students are given hands-on materials to create with they get excited about the activity and forget that they are learning. They quickly are engaged and ready to write, read or discuss ideas when they have their project in front of them that they just created. If every topic can be attached to a hands-on project then these students are unstoppable! With these Quill materials we will be able to accomplish several activities. The bulletin board materials will be a great visual connection for the students during our Dr Seuss celebration unit. Students start to engage in discussions about the stories and make connections to stories they have read by Dr Seuss. The fish bank will be a craft related to the fish in the Dr Seuss stories. We will us the banks for storing rhyming words we learn, and descriptive writing pieces will be written about the fish they have created. They will also be carried over to our math unit involving money.

My goal is to teach students to use technology and for them to use it to learn and teach those around them. Using the newest technology to do this will ensure that these students are ready for the real world- and ahead of their peers. Our school is a new charter school in Asheville, NC with an amazing vision. My classroom consists of 3 groups of the most amazing 4th and 5th graders I've ever met. Altogether about 90 kids come through the door each day. These kids are ready to learn and want (and deserve!) to use technology to do so. The projector, speakers, and Bamboo tablet (and accessories) will be used for me to present information in an interactive and engaging way. The students will also use these items to present what they learn with projects we complete throughout the year. The students will use the iPads to research and practice what we learn. These items will make research possible at school. Currently there isn't a way for students to get online. Being able to see and hear what is projected will make the lessons more interactive and fun.

It is located in the East Rogers Park area of the City of Chicago. 95% of the students population receives free or reduced lunch. Because of this, money is spent on the necessities and not on technology. This means my students do not have the same access to technology in the classroom as other schools and other students. My middle school students are eager to learn and excited to share what they have already learned. Technology in the classroom provides us with endless opportunities to both share what we have learned and to continue to learn. My goal is to prepare my middle school students for what comes after they leave my classroom and this school. In order to do that I must provide them with the tools and the opportunities to use technology on a regular basis. My Middle School students will use these Chromebooks in varying ways throughout the school year. For example, they will be able to use publication programs and software to create and publish their written work. They will be able to access the Internet, where they can conduct research, practice skills, review concepts, and learn new material. With this type of technology available at all times, my students will have access to a wide range of resources that will enhance learning and further understanding in all content areas. Students will also have an opportunity to learn how to properly use the internet to gain a perspective of the global community in which they live.

Their learning, due to language barriers, needs to involve technology (visuals) to help them close the learning gap. Learning needs to be hands-on. Hands-on requires technology. As mentioned above, the majority of our students are from war-torn countries and their families have come to the United States for better opportunities and education. Most are on free and reduced lunch and their time in school is extremely important because that is where we can help them as most of them do not have the support at home due to the language barrier.

We really need to use technology: visuals, examples - that can only be found online. Our school is a K-12 and we do have technology (slightly older) but to spread it between 8 grades is difficult. Often times we cannot use them because they are being used for assessments. To have a set in my classroom to use in World History - as well as my college readiness class (to do projects on careers and colleges) would help the learning immensely. I would, of course, share with the other teachers when not using them. The students are so eager! My AVID - college readiness - students will use the computers to research colleges and careers as well as complete projects. Last year they held a college fair and presented the information to the students in the lower grades and it really helped to unite the school and form a community as all the students get to know each other. Learning will be reinforced and the laptops can be used in a variety of ways to help a variety of students in multiple grades.

The kids actually enjoy practicing because it seems like a game! Motivation is a critical component of learning. These iPads are highly prized by the students and they will be eager to spend time practicing their math facts when they have access to this technology.

I will help students find e-books to check out from the local library, thus using our limited resources to stretch what we can offer our students. Students will be able to read at their level, without any social stigma of having a book that looks uncool or too young. The Kindle provides support for struggling readers in many ways, notably an integrated dictionary, text-to-voice read aloud feature for unknown words, and adjustable font size. Initial research in the field also indicates that the 'cool' factor of reading with new technology can increase students' motivation, especially when supported by a librarian who can help them find just right books to read. As the school librarian, I often see myself as a cheerleader for reading. But I know many of my students struggle with reading and hate checking out books at their level-- especially if that means books that seem too short, too young, and definitely not cool. My goal is to help all kids find books that make them want to read. Ian, who loves graphic novels but doesn't always sink into a novel, said, 'I like the feel of reading on the Kindle. It makes me want to read more.' Hooray!! ","My students need 10 Kindles, covers, and adapters to support and engage reluctant readers.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Technology,1831.56,Expired

I am hoping to show my students that some of those great secrets can be found inside wordless picture books. It is my honor and privilege to be able to teach a group of 27 highly motivated and intelligent first grade students in Illinois. We are a Title 1 school in a high poverty area. For a majority of my students, English is their second language. It is my goal to provide my students with every opportunity for success. In this case, I want to help them grow into competent readers by helping them establish a solid literacy foundation and a love for books. That is where wordless picture books come in! For some of my students, there is nothing more frustrating than picking up a book that is too hard to for them read or a book that is falling apart. At first glance, it might appear that wordless picture books are simple stories, when in reality, they are very complex. Wordless books are perfect for introducing new vocabulary, improving oral language skills and developing higher-level thinking skills. They are perfect for students of all ability levels, not to mention the fun and enjoyment my students get when reading them. Their confidence will soar when they see that everyone can read! The books I have selected like, Hank Finds an Egg and Journey, will promote creativity and spark the imagination of my first graders. They will also help me show my students that everyone in our classroom is a reader... even if they are only using the pictures to tell the story.

We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We strive to help every student to meet their needs. We provide additional materials and health services if needed. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We instituted academic clubs after school, and pull-out programs to reinforce academics. Because of these additional programs, our students have done well on standardized tests. We have developed a recipe for success. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. I requested colored paper and markers to help start a superior art program at the beginning of the year. We are lacking in basic supplies. The supplies will help a special weaving project and many other projects throughout the year. The students will learn the need for 'weaving through many lands.' Students will feel connected though their cultures. They will be able to create beautiful paper Kente cloths and learn the meaning behind them. Students will make Mexican paper weaving influenced by Mexican Zapotec rugs and blankets. These weaving will have symbols and patterns created by the markers requested. They will also use twigs and pipe cleaners to make beautiful weaving influenced by Haitian weaving of baskets and displays. Some students will weave using twigs linking their weaving to birds weaving nests. The materials requested will help provide an exciting weaving unit and help fund future art projects. Students will synthesize connections with their heritages through the arts. They will explore many reasons for weaving. Most birds weave nests so their nests do not get blown away.

Incorporating technology through tablets allows the world to be readily available and will deepen our students thinking while learning. My students are wonderful second graders who are eager to learn. They come from a wide variety of racial and language backgrounds and almost fifty percent of them qualify for free or reduced lunch. Some have access to computers at home but many are only exposed to technology at school. Some travel to Europe for a long weekend and some do not know where their next meal is coming from. The disparity is vast in Berkeley and the classroom is the bridge for all students. This year we have fully implemented Common Core State Standards. We are in need of technology within our rooms that easily used and accessible to young children. My goal is for our students to be able to use ipads to support evidence based thinking through technology that is user friendly. Ipads allow for young children to research topics of interest and access any skill work they may need through apps and web sites. My students are excited about learning and are always looking for more ways to expand their knowledge. In the classroom we often need to practice math facts, a way to research topics, and often have a need to answer questions immediately so we can then think deeply about the world around us. If my students could easily access the world through technology, it would increase their general knowledge about the world they live in. Our students would have extra opportunities for use of educational websites. My overall goal would be to have the students rotate on to the ipads as one of their daily learning centers. If a student needs additional help with math, but excels in language arts, there will be apps that allow for that student to practice math facts. Ipads also provide opportunities for students to explore science, writing and social studies with sites like Mobymax.com. This site individualizes content areas for students so they can expand the individual learning in any area they choose. It also provides the teacher with immediate feedback on each student's progress. Motivation is a critical component of learning. These ipads are highly prized items by my students. This technology will make them eager to practice their math facts, research topics, or answer questions they have while reading.

The students range from homeless to living in a private country club. 30% are African American, 30% are Hispanic, and 30% are white. The students will read A Long Walk to Water. It aligns with their social studies and language arts curriculum. This novel will teach students about identify and social conflict through a globally relevant topic. While also focusing on necessary reading comprehension and common core standards. Students will explore the experiences of people of Southern Sudan during and after the Second Sudanese Civil War. They will build proficiency in using textual evidence to support ideas in their writing, both in shorter responses and in an extended essay. As students begin the novel, A Long Walk to Water, they will read closely to practice citing evidence and drawing inferences from this compelling text as they begin to analyze and contrast the points of view of the two central characters, Salva and Nya. They also will read supplemental informational text to gather evidence on the perspectives of the Dinka and Nuer tribes of Southern Sudan. This novel will provide insight into global awareness and teach middle schoolers about the importance of individual identity. It also lends itself to an easy alignment between social studies and language arts, which in turn will assist in decreasing the reading gap and bridging the two subjects.

My students will listen to a story about Alexander Calder, discuss, and view samples of his 3-d wire works and mobiles for inspiration. Some classes will make mobiles using colored pipe cleaners wires, and beads to create fish. Other classes will make 3-d standing stationary sculpture which are called stabiles. They will make the stationary sculptures with shapes and wires representing wried sculptures that Alexander Calder was famous for. They will be colorful and mounted on the poster board. Students will be exposed to a famous artist Alexander Calder and learn another style of art by creating wire sculpture. They will use a kinesthetic approach of creating a 3-d sculpture.

Imagine the delight on their faces at having the resources they use during their daily centers in color when all they have previously had has been in black and white! You can only imagine the motivation that color can bring! My kindergarten classroom is filled with a wide range of energetic students--from those who have had minimal experiences in their lives to those who have had many. They are eager to learn and greet each new experience with enthusiasm! We are part of an awesome school community in Kansas that works very hard to meet the needs of each student in spite of continuing budget cuts. As a teacher, I have spent much of my personal money on classroom resources through online accounts such as TeachersPayTeachers, Mailbox and Scholastic. Much to my dismay I then discovered that many of those resources needed to be printed in color to make them usable in the classroom. Having access to a color printer, card stock to print on and ink refills for sustainability will finally allow us to use the resources purchased as they were intended. This will allow my students to learn more effectively as they will have colorful resources for centers, literacy and math games, and writing activities as a part of their daily learning experiences. Seeing this project fulfilled will add the motivation that color can bring into a classroom. My students will be able to use materials as the learning tools they were intended to be. We will not have to spend precious learning time 'coloring in pictures' to get resources ready to be used, but rather will be able to use our learning time wisely.

They love working on computers and shrill with excitement everyday their name is called to work on words. Because I only have two computers for 28 kids, they aren't able to use technology as much as they would like (or I would like). Ipads are wonderful learning tools that engage students in a variety of ways. They excite, motivate and inspire kids to learn a variety of subjects. The apps available for free is AWESOME. Students will engage in early reading skills such as letter naming, hearing letter sounds, tracing letters, rhyming, working on sight-words, counting, solving math equations, and reading. Not only will we utilize the apps, but iPads are a great tool to record students' reading abilities and then play it back to them to reflect on how they have grown as readers. They also would be utilized for me to assess current reading levels using the DRA program. Completing these on the iPads would save our school paper and ink as we would update our paper-pencil record keeping to digital. 'Every Child Succeeds.'

That is how it was for my first graders when I introduced them to the Elephant and Piggie series by Mo Willems. They so love Piggie and her friend Gerald that the characters feel like two more kids in our classroom! I teach at a public alternative school. The literacy workshop curriculum keeps the students active and engaged. Like every primary teacher, my class includes kids who are already reading, as well as kids who are just dipping their feet in the water. It is for this latter group, in particular, that I am requesting a Donors Choose grant. I hope to buy a large set of these magical books that kids won't put down! I hope you'll come on board with me! Beginning readers confidently read what each character is saying because they have learned their personalities and ways of interacting. Pictures of them and their talking balloons have started surfacing in the students' drawings and I have even heard familiar exchanges during the kids' spontaneous drama. I knew we were on to something good, but unfortunately, there are not enough books in the classroom or library to satisfy this thirst. I want to use the Elephant and Piggie books in Readers Theater activities with students to help them build confidence and voice as readers. A larger collection of them can increase their use as take home, read-aloud-to-family books, because they are books these kids are dying to read aloud. When the occasional book is left at home, the other kids will not feel so disappointed. Elephant and Piggie will also contribute to my students' growth as writers, as the kids are already drawing these beloved characters and captioning their conversations with speech bubbles modeled after those in the texts. More copies spread out on the tables will invite them to add words they have memorized, or copy words that express what they want to say. Sight words will serve the greatest purpose (rather than flashcard practice), rounded out with best guess spelling that builds phonics knowledge and fluency with writing. In short, Elephant and Piggie (and the Pigeon) inspire, and inspired readers are fearless readers. Because my children believe in and love the voices of these characters and their friends (yes, there is a snake, a bat, a bird...), they are building their own voices as readers in order to spend time with these characters, and then extending that inspiration in writing.

My first graders are just beginning to develop their reading skills, and they LOVE to listen to books on CD. Students need to hear a story come alive and see it unfold in their hands. What better way than with a listening center? The children in my district come from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. All the children have the desire to learn. Some, do not have the family support necessary to encourage success. My students want to be cared about and want positive reinforcement for their good deeds. Our school tries to provide the children with a 'family' style atmosphere, hoping that each child thrives in his/her life. My students will have the opportunity to go to the listening center and listen to stories that they cannot yet read independently. Our listening center will help support reading fiction and nonfiction books (books about what we learn in science and social studies). It will also help students improve reading fluency and comprehension. Students will rotate through our centers and listen/read along with the stories and then respond to the book in writing. This listening center can also be used for 'early finishers' and as a reward for great behavior. The best part of this project is that it will benefit my current students as well as my future students! This project will ensure that my students are exposed to different types of literature, thus instilling in them a love of reading!

9bec4e7c81e8c5fc0a8d46ec8fb37289,Puppet Theatre Lighting,"Our puppet theatre troupe is filled with students who are innovators, engineers, artists, performers, musicians and craftsmen. Right now a typical day involves learning movement, breath and teamwork, building practice puppets, sculpting heads, making masks, painting props, paper mache work and more. My students come from all walks of life. Our school accepts students from the entire county and we have a very high percentage of students from inner-city Flint. Our school truly has a diverse population. Our city has been hit hard with poverty and that does transfer into the classroom in many forms. My students tend to be quite creative but lack the experience of having the arts offered at their previous schools. They can be challenging, hilarious, smart, caring, empathetic and kind. One thing that does set our school apart is our commitment and involvement in the community. We have a great reputation in our town. We are considered an alternative to a traditional high school. This means that we have many non-traditional students, students that do not fit your typical mold. We are an early college and a middle college. Students start taking college in their 9th grade year and stay a 5th year in order to get more college credits and a potential Associates degree. With a lighting system we will be able to present our high school puppet theatre called 'Fli-Town Puppet Theatre'. We need lights to be able to present the atmosphere that is needed for a puppet show to be truly engaging, artistic, dramatic and fun. Our puppet theatre is new this year. One thing that is important to us is to be able to be portable. We want to share our shows with our community as well as other schools. The lighting system that we are trying to get funded is light, portable, isn't hot and dangerous, and is made up of new technology that is beneficial for our students, especially if they are planning to get into any part of entertainment or theatre. They will learn how to focus lights, change colors, fade in and out, design a lighting set up for specific spaces. They will learn what it means to be a gaffer, a technician, the artistry around lighting design, power, electricity and more. And of course what it means to put on a play and present puppets to our community. If we are able to get our project funded it will directly impact our ability to present a high quality theatrical puppet play. Our puppet theatre does not use a traditional Muppet style puppet. We are making European style puppets mixed with traditional Japanese Bunraku style. This means we have 2 to 3 students controlling each puppet. For them to come to life we need a controlled lighting set up to allow us to camouflage our actors on stage bringing attention to the puppets themselves.

b9c058d4923f04e9cf4138f3f5960e70,Helping Students Focus and Achieve,"We do all we can to use technology in our curriculum, though many of our students cannot afford a set of headphones. When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

These students have been faced with a lot but never give up a challenge. These students come from different backgrounds. They enjoy coming to school and are always eager to learn. We just need more resources to help them be able to do so. Our school is a Title One school which means that 70% or more of our students receive free/reduced lunch. Kids with special needs tend to be very sensory. We see this a lot in our classroom. Our kids need to have sensory items available for them to hold and I will admit, I don't have a lot of these items available when needed. Our students tend to fidget and become unfocused after periods of time. Having these sensory items available will not only help to increase time on task but they will also help with behavior management as well. Some items will reinforce strategies taught during class as well. Students will be able to hold these items and be more focused on what is being taught. The sensory bar desk buddies will be an item for students to touch while doing their work. The letter formation tray and tactile sand numbers will help with students who are sensory and are still learning their letters and numbers. The sensory balls will be another item for kids to hold. The gel boards will help with the writing and the shoes will help with tying shoes. Donations will to this project will help our students to be more successful in and out of the classroom. Because of your donation, our students will be able to have more resources to help them learn in the classroom.

Some of my students are better at math, others love science or sports but they all arrive excited and ready to learn every day. Everyone's learning has its own time-table. I have students who catch on like lightening while others who are just as enthusiastic need extra examples or some individual help. I have 11 who are new to the program this year so it would be very helpful to have mini-ipads available for the ones who finish early. They could visit webpages I have created for the class, play games in German or visit some of the many children's educational websites available in German while I work with small groups or individuals. Some of our families do not have Internet access at home so this would be a good opportunity for those students to experience using to internet to reinforce their learning. The amount of comprehensible input a learner processes is directly correlated to his/her level of success. In other words, the more German I can give them in meaningful and interesting ways, the better their proficiency will be.

My students and I have decided to do a monthly service project to give to those in need. I want to give back to my class by having this project fully funded this month. I teach 27 fourth graders in a fabulous school. Our mission statement states, 'We are building stronger minds, bodies, and spirits together.' I think this applies to everything we do. Each year our school makes donations to Make-a-Wish, Pennies for Patients, Animal Shelters, Zoos, and many other organizations. We are a hard working, dedicated, and caring community striving to make the world a better place one act of kindness at a time. We know that our actions will ripple throughout the community. Please bring some joy to your life and join us in our efforts! This project would allow us to create sign ups, share our community service pictures, and find more organizations in need. Thus far we have planned, blanket and food donations around the holidays, animal shelter donations, visits to a local nursing home, treats for our local heroes (police, firefighters, military), and care packages overseas. In order to complete all of these tasks, we are going to need this project fully funded. You could be a part of our ripple of kindness. We have requested items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, granola bars, and soap to make care packages to donate to homeless shelters. We have requested pre-made care packages with snacks for our heroes in our local community (police, firefighters, etc) and for our heroes overseas (our American soldiers fighting for our freedoms). We are truly grateful to have the resources to be able to provide these service projects to make our world a better place and bring a smile. There's no better feeling in the world! We believe that bullying doesn't exist when students are working together to better the lives of those around them. Each act of kindness is a small reminder of how we are working as a team to build a stronger community. And we do have to work together for this to succeed.

We are an Open School where students are taught to be critical thinkers and give their own voice to each project they embark on. Hard working, enthusiastic, and extremely joyful, they devour all arts opportunities presented to them. They LOVE to create and perform and jump at the chance to share their creations. 'Orff Instruments' (in this project, xylophones) are specifically designed for elementary and middle school use. Students not only use them to learn and accompany known songs and pieces, but more importantly to create their own arrangements, compositions, and solos. They are a fabulously accessible instrument that allows all students to participate in music making. They also help dramatically in differentiation- students and the teacher can tailor learning to the needs of each student by making the music as simple or complex as appropriate. Students will perform large pieces in an ensemble, accompany songs in the classroom, and create their own arrangements and compositions. The general music program at our school is being rebuilt from the ground up- we started the year with an empty room. With extremely limited funds we are not able to purchase these, or many other, instruments and classroom supplies. Ideally, someday we will have one instrument for each student in the class.

They will also be able to read the text independently and create a project based on what they have read and learned. This will teach the students responsibility because they take learning into their own hands. The learning is student centered and fun!

(Bickart, Jablon, & Dodge 1999). This quote shows the importance and value of center/stations in the classroom. My students are excited to learn. They have great attendance and love coming to school! At school they are safe, encouraged, and supported. Sadly, our inner city school has been labeled high priority by our state. Our test scores are just not good enough. We also have over 90% free and reduced lunch and many homeless and highly mobile students. But, my students are eager to succeed in learning and life! To keep my students engaged and excited about learning we do stations. During stations, small groups of students spend time working on a specific skill, like phonics. Twenty minutes later, we rotate to a new station to practice another skill, vocabulary. The same is true for math, students rotate from working on money, to telling time, to using numbers. Stations allow students to practice multiple skills, and work cooperatively with others. Using stations, I am able to meet with smaller groups of students or even one on one to reach students who need extra support in a given area. Stations provide a predictable routine for students, with embedded cooperative learning skills, and academic challenge. My students love stations! They love the easy rotation structure and routine in the classroom. One thing they are missing is a little more fun! The student are kind and act like they don't mind my old dice, or different worksheets, but I know they would love some more engaging activities. These puzzle will totally engage my students in their learning activities. They will be completely 'tricked' into learning and practicing many new skills. I can't wait to see the look on their faces!

They come from all backgrounds and there are at least three languages spoken in my classroom. They are full of energy and excitement for learning. For many of my students, school is what they most look forward to in their daily lives. The students will use the iPads to learn math, writing, reading, and art skills. They will also be using the internet to learn about the world around us. The use of modern technology will make whatever we are learning about more engaging and exciting for my students.

My students get very excited when I am able to bring new technology into the classroom. It gets them excited about learning. We do centers for 30 minutes each day. I feel bad because most of the time the students are working on paper centers that I have printed off the Internet and laminated. This listening center will give them a center to be excited about, and give them something to look forward to each day. I am asking for a CD player with multiple headphones and jacks so that 5-6 students can listen to books being read to them. I am also asking for 8 sets of 4-5 books with CD's so the students can follow along as the story is read to them and a container for each book so that it can bee kept organized. It will make my students better readers. It will also help boost their vocabulary through the books. It will improve their comprehension skills as well, because they will not have to focus so much on sounding out the words. They will then be able to focus on the content in the story.

It's important to give them something they can identify with and connect to their own world. The school consists of 95% English Language Learners which presents special challenges. Students read at a variety of levels, from non-English beginners to grade-level proficient. They love reading! The school district, serving low-income families, has a limited budget, and it is up to teachers to find ways to provide even the basics of the classroom.

These high-interest books will also give them the practice navigating through different types of books. Additionally, they'll be able to share book experiences with others in accordance with the Common Core Learning Standards. When I look at the books we grew up with, I think of 'Fun with Dick and Jane.' We have come a long way! It's time to show the kids how fun reading can be. Providing a variety of books will strengthen their self-esteem as they read about characters they can relate to.

We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past six years, our small program has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. As the program continues to grow, we would also like to have a logo t-shirt that will help us identify our students while traveling, and give them a sense of pride in the program that they have worked so hard to be part of. This year, a dedicated group of students will be traveling throughout Japan. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the economic structure of an international superpower, compare the education system with that of our own, and strengthen their interview and public speaking skills by shadowing employers in a variety of markets, most notably commerce and technology.

Instruction in functional academics and life skills helps students increase independence and prepare for real life situations. At times, though, a student's sensitivity to loud noises and other things in the general school environment and community makes participation in these settings challenging. For my current students, music serves as a universal soother. Although each student has different music likes, covering their ears with their preferred music masks other environmental noises and helps them function better in the various settings. Music also serves as a high preference motivator. With mp3 players, students can discretely take music on the go.

Most students come to school for their breakfast, lunch and a snack. Even with the added pressure of food, all of my students are willing to learn. At my school we work hard to make sure all our students are able to succeed. Most of the time we spend our own money on little items to better our students experience at school. I am asking for a new listening station. My students love to listen to stories. It is a highlight of their day in Kindergarten. We are in desperate need of a new listening station because our current listening station broke. They have been so disappointed that they are unable to listen to their favorite stories. Listening to stories helps improve not only our listening skills but also our reading skills. We work on reading fluency, finding words we know, and retelling stories. With this new listening station my students will be able to listen to their favorite stories thus improving their reading fluency and reading skills.

Although 90% of the students receive free or reduced lunch and live in a low socioeconomic are, it doesn't affect their enthusiasm for learning. I would love to reward their eager minds with a hands on learning experience that they may only experience at school. We need protective cases for our recently funded iPads. The students will use the protective cases for the iPads for everyday activities. They will be able to carry the iPads from place to place without the fear of scratching or causing damage to it. The cases will also be able to 'hold' the iPad while they relax and read. As far as the iPads, they use them throughout the day. They use them mainly for Daily 5 stations. They are also used for behavior management, as a reward. We will also use the iPads for research projects, class videos, and mathematics. There are endless possibilities for iPad uses in our classroom. An iPad in the classroom would help expose my students to manipulating math problems, reading on a computer screen, and typing out their writing. It will prepare them better for advanced grades, they will be more accustomed to technology. By implementing the iPads in the classroom, students are opened to countless learning opportunities. From reading to math to science or social studies. Our generation is currently in a technology world, why not accommodate them with what they know best in a safe way. With protective cases, the students will be able to move around the room without the fear of dropping an unprotected iPad. Kids will be kids, especially 18 first graders.

I teach 7th grade Texas history within a district that has not only a high mobility rate amongst the students, but a high turnover rate amongst the teachers. I use incentives for positive behavior through points they earn on Class Dojo. The majority of my students live below poverty. Our entire school receives free breakfast and lunch for the students. They come from single parent homes and foster care. Many of them are 3-4 years behind on their reading levels and most of them have never taken a history class before. I have over 10% of my students who are SPED, 504, Dyslexic or suffer from severe emotional disturbances. Additionally up to 40% of my students are classified as LEP or Limited English Proficiency. My school is plagued with frequent fighting, skipping classes and parents who do not involve themselves in their children's success. I need these books for more ideas on how to help my students and give them the opportunity to excel in spite of their circumstances. The other small items are used as prizes for a certain number of Class Dojo points which gives the kids something to work towards and to feel like they achieved something. My students come into class and know that if they work hard, answer questions, raise their hand before speaking, help around the classroom, treat each other with respect and work hard they will earn more and more points which they can then turn in for things which they want. We have to wear student IDs all day but the lanyards provided are very cheap and break easily, so the children would love the opportunity to earn new lanyards in their favorite colors as a ways of expressing themselves. This goes the same for the shoelaces, any sense of individuality they can have while in uniform is a huge incentive for them to exhibit positive behavior and respect. I've seen firsthand how giving my students incentives for good behavior has turned around their behavior for the better. I'm concerned that my inability to keep affording small prizes will hinder their desire to work hard and thus, their grades will not improve.

They are willing to work through adversity to reach their goals. They have great can do attitudes. Academic success is their primary focus each day. And they are just darn nice kids. The primary concern is my physically challenged students. Each year 2 to 4 students with physical limitations takes photography. Often these students are incapable of holding a camera still or even focus. With this camera we can interface it with an IPad that allows the student to focus the camera, compose the image, adjust ISO, Aperture and shutter speed. It also allows them to fire the camera. The iPad gives them immediate feed back on how the image looks. Currently, the DSLR's we have are not advanced enough to run the adaptive device (a Cam-Ranger). This device will make a difference in my classroom in two ways. The first way is that it will make photography accessible to the physically challenged students I get each year.

Alice WalkerMy students come alive through the beautification of our school through gardening. As a veteran teacher at my high school, I wondered if beauty affected the learning process. This year I found out. I had an idea in my environmental science class. The students supported and jumped right in. Most come from broken homes and impoverished neighborhoods. Often times, school is the place where they can get away from their realities at home. Our school would be the perfect escape if they had something to look forward to. Our class is filled with seniors whom have yet to see their school at it's peak of success. There is a need for that success. As a teacher I wish for my students to bask in the beauty of awesomeness. I wish for them to start a legacy that will be passed on. I wish for them to return to their home and see how they have contributed to the success of their community. This starts with the beautification of our campus. Someone once planted some roses in our courtyards. The roses have not reached their full potential. Students will learn how to prune and care for our roses to make them thrive. We currently started a vegetable garden in a courtyard and used old planters in another area of our school to continue planting. We have been walking our water hose from one side of campus to another. A hose cart would be the perfect tool to make this process more efficient. Our water nozzle has broken and we are in need of another. We have been manipulating the water as it comes out of the hose by placing our thumb on the end of the spout. We are desperately in need of outdoor gardening soil and or manure. Our ground is not fertile. Students will learn the elements needed in soil to create a sustainable growing environment for plants and vegetables. They will also be able to participate in soil testing labs. Knowing that anonymous people are investing in their efforts will help change their attitudes toward people in life. The beautification of our school through gardening will allow the students to gain the hands on experience in agricultural studies. This will also be the catalyst of projects to come and future partnerships for our school as we move forward.

The elite musicians from my classes have been selected and have been diligently practicing difficult music for the upcoming UIL competition. The skills they have mastered from learning to read music, to the discipline they have learned from consistent practice, are life-long skills that are needed in life and any career.

They are passionate about discovering what they don't know and learning more about what they already understand. Please help make this a reality for them! My classroom is comprised entirely of students with severe behavior issues across 3 grade levels. Included in my classroom are a number of students with severe ADHD and other behaviors that have greatly impacted their learning. These students do not respond to traditional pencil and paper learning. I teach in a self-contained classroom, my students come to me from around my district after they have struggled in their home school. The school that I am at has a staggeringly high poverty rate, and my entire room is comprised of high poverty students. Many of my students feel like they have been written off by every adult in their lives. They all desperately desire to learn, though, and are hungry for a chance to read. Throughout their lives they've been made to feel like learning is something that they never will be able to achieve, but they are passionate to prove those naysayers wrong. My hope with this project is to continue using an alternative way to engage my students in learning. Throughout my building, teachers are experimenting with technology as a way to reach some of our most reluctant learners, including students with severe ADHD. We are seeing tremendous success with unique forms of technology that students in our building have no opportunity to see at home. In our room we have 3 NOOKS and they are always being used. Students are always clamoring to use them, and I simply can't keep up with demand. Students who previously refused to read are reading entire novels and novel series. These NOOKS have been game changers for us. The iPad mini will be a great teaching tool to help differentiate learning and continue to get students reading. There are a number of applications geared to reading that my students would greatly benefit from. This will be immensely important in a multi-age classroom where students are working at all different levels.

Honestly, many of my students struggle, some with previously mentioned issues, many with academics. I am grateful to be able to share this time with them and to support their growth and independence. Together, we work together to learn, play, grow, and create a community of hope and respect in classroom 211. One of the times I find my students most engaged, critically thinking, sharing and creating community is when I read out loud to them and allow safe space for the authentic conversations that are generated based on topics from the novel. The majority of my students are struggling readers with grade level reading skills ranging from the 2nd grade on up. Each student faces their own challenges with reading; some are still at the decoding stage while others struggle with vocabulary or with determining theme. I've chosen the book, Wonder, by R. J. Palacio as the book I would like to read with my students 3rd quarter. I have chosen this book because it is about a young boy with a facial deformity embarking upon his first year in middle school. The characters in the novel are rich and are easy to relate to, which I feel will even further engage my students in a story filled with relationships, the damage done by bullying, and ultimately finding the courage to be yourself. Donations to this project will improve my classroom as it allows for engaging, meaningful conversation and community building, as well as providing an opportunity to improve reading skills and strategies that will serve to make students better readers.

As a third grade teacher and life-long learner, I encourage my students to explore and go beyond the walls of our classroom. My class of 13 boys and 11 girls is a lively one. This group of children is first kind and cooperative with one another. They set their personal academic goals, and respect individual starting points knowing our class objective is growth for all. Our school and district is quaint and clean. It is full of caring parents, staff, teachers, and administrators. We are not a wealthy district or community, but we make do. The kids greet me at the door each morning with a handshake and smile. They come ready to learn, yet teach me something new each day!The technology available to the students is limited and outdated. This restricts both my ability and theirs with regard to exposing and exploring all the wonderful things that lie beyond our little school, district, and community. Technology is not the be-all and end-all of education, but it can provide children with experiences that they might not otherwise have growing up in a small somewhat rural town. I am seeking an iPad with a protective case for my classroom. The protective case with 24 third graders is self-explanatory, but let me share with you the purpose of the iPad. Technology of today has opened the door to more resources than one can imagine for adults and children alike. On a daily basis, my children would be able to utilize various online literacy and math programs which are not available to them outside of the school. These programs support the struggling student, the 'average' student, as well as the student who is ready for the next step in their education. Having an iPad would allow more children the chance to engage in these learning opportunities. More importantly, an iPad in our classroom would provide children with the ability to listen to books while following along. This will build fluency, as well as expose the children to a wider variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction with their specific needs and interests taken into account. The addition of an iPad to our two classroom computers (each over two decades old) will not revolutionize my teaching, as I believe what Bill Gates has said, 'Technology is just a tool.

As in most schools, parents and teachers strive day in and day out to provide a nurturing, safe, enriching, meaningful school experience. However, the parents who send their children to us often have a unique struggle - providing the basics for the families' survival. Sadly, many families are faced with the incomprehensible reality of providing their children with clothing and food or providing them with school supplies. With the emergence of the PARCC exam and the technical demands it is placing on our school, the resources for the greater school community are being stretched even further. This often means no supplemental materials can be obtained. This is the main reason I am turning to Donors Choose.

With the new demands of the Common Core Curriculum, I find many of my students are struggling with basic math and reading skills. Honestly, despite my absolute best efforts, they are falling behind. Several of my students have special needs and require a great deal of additional support and practice.

I am also asking for several math trade books that I believe will help the students connect these often foreign and/or abstract concepts to their own experiences. Your donation would significantly improve the everyday experiences of my students, who even in 2nd grade, feel the pressures of not only their education, but also of their personal circumstances. The donation would be utilized for years to come. My students are, beyond all else, appreciative. Your donation would be met with a classroom full of smiles of the lips of children.

I am working hard to improve that situation by acquiring engaging formats like graphic novels and the TOON books. My school library is more than books on shelves. It is a place where students go to Think, Create, Share, and Grow! Cultivating resources that tie into creativity, play, and literacy will grow lifelong readers. I serve over 550 PreK through 4th grade students at a Title 1 school. Our diverse student body comes from six of the seven continents. They are joyful learners and readers that inspire me with their enthusiasm every day. Some have no access to the public library as their parents are not users. Many do not have their own books in their homes. Though they come to the library weekly as part of school, I am hoping to create opportunities for them to come after school and even over the summer. Library use improves literacy, curiosity, and life long learning. I am a big believer in graphic novels and other comic type materials. They serve to engage even the most reluctant readers - stories and characters that capture their imagination, illustrations that help facilitate comprehension and promote confidence in understanding. My husband was a comic shop owner. Many of his customers were people that struggled with reading until they found the format. With that passion, the time they spent in text increased and their ability and willingness to read grew exponentially. Many credit their academic success to their early passion for reading through comics. The TOON books I am trying to purchase will allow me to provide that same experience for my struggling students, many of whom are English Language Learners or receiving Special Education services. A circulating collection of these books for my library would put them in the hands of struggling readers. The TOON books are a new, fresh approach to giving new readers stories and characters they will engage with in a popular format. I can't speak highly enough of these books - I have three in my library already and they are never in. Adding to that collection would only serve to generate exciting about reading and the library.

I have told them that I want to inspire them. I want them to learn about a famous pop artist named Andy Warhol. I teach art to a wonderful group of k-5 students. They are sponges eager to soak up everything. When they see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know what the next art project is. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We have academic clubs and after school tutoring and daily academic pull-out programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements Andy Warhol was known for creating tomato soup can paintings along with creating art from everyday objects. I want my students to work in small groups. ESOL and ESE students will be paired within the groups. The groups will collaborate using books and iPads to explore the famous pop artist. Using critical thinking skills, students will discuss that everyday objects in life can be art. They will see the connections and need for jobs in the art field. Warhol was a commercial artist. They will be inspired from Warhol to make a creative new kind of soup label to market. The pencils and paper requested will help students write, discuss, and plan their work. The markers requested will help add the color needed for the designs. Perhaps it will be a can of Peanut Butter Soup with a dancing peanut. Maybe it will be Creamy Chocolate Soup. Students will enjoy learning about pop art, collaborating and creating a new pop art soup and label to market. I'm looking forward to sharing photographs. Students will learn about a famous artist and recreate his work in a creative way. Students will learn about commercial art and that there are many careers in art. They will learn that art is in everyday objects. By donating to this project you are helping bring enrichment and quality materials to the arts.

They need to see their futures can be limitless. This trip will help fuel those dreams. Seventy-five percent of my students are from a minority background, either first or second generation. Most of these students' families have no post-secondary education. Sixty percent of my school is receiving free-and-reduced lunch. A great majority of my students want to attend college, but they lack the family exposure to a wide variety of college or career options. These students have struggled to master the language of their new country, succeed in school, and adapt to their new home. These students have internalized the American Dream and long to explore the advantages that America has to offer. Many of my students see daily their parents struggling in low-paying jobs to make ends meet. These students long to break that cycle and move towards jobs that are both fulfilling and financially secure. They need exposure to new, exciting, and rewarding career options. My National Honor Society students will explore the Oklahoma City science museum with a guided tour that allows free time for students to explore exhibits that attract their attention. Once students have piqued their interest and realized the excitement that science can hold for them, they will be given a presentation on various careers that can be pursued in different scientific fields. Students will be motivated to take advanced courses in both math and science to equip them for college work. This trip is also coordinated with the school counselor who works intimately with students in supplying them with information about college choices including scholarship and grant materials. My students will be able to see how exciting science can be firsthand and hear stories about careers in scientific fields. They will learn that these options are within their grasps. This knowledge will improve their high school education as they are motivated into higher math and science courses and influence their college and career decisions. They will realize that they can have a career that is both fulfilling and important, helping them to attain their portion of the American Dream.

My caseload includes students with autism, selective mutism, intellectual disability, language disorders, and developmental delays. My project is specifically designed for those students with autism and selective mutism. I work with them directly on social communication skills which is very stressful and difficult for them. Many of them dislike school due to the anxiety caused by having to communicate with peers and adults. I have had success with having them come into the speech room with a buddy or two and complete puzzles, play board games or build with Lego's. My supply, however, is quite low and I am in need of a bigger variety of high interest puzzle and building toys to keep their engagement and enthusiasm up as well as their peers. With the addition of the puzzles and magnetic toys I've requested, my students will have more choices of what they can do with their speech buddies. The few items that I have used to date have allowed one of my students with significant anxiety related to autism and selective mutism to begin to build friendships with two other boys in his class. He is able to practice looking at others when he speaks, asking questions, initiating conversation, and being flexible when interacting with others. His mother reports that he no longer fights coming to school because he has something to look forward to every day before lunch. This project will allow my students to practice their communication skills, make friends and have fun while working on speech, social communication, problem solving, and language skills.

All of them struggle to learn because they have a disability. They come from regular, Designed Instruction, and Behavior classrooms to work with me several times a day. I'm great at teaching them what they need to know, but having books with which to practice their new skills gets trickier. My students need a more Elephant and Piggy books they can read, and an Elephant and Piggy stuffed animal to cuddle. I have a few Piggy and Elephant books on my shelf still (they get borrowed and loved to death) which my new gang of beginning readers just discovered. It would be terrific to have more! We love the controlled vocabulary, the engaging pictures, the social skills themes, and the fact that students WANT to read them. Every week students spend some time in our book corner while I conduct quick assessments. They are allowed to borrow books as often as they want. These books will provide hours of reading practice for my little learners. We will also use them as the basis of social skills training. Who wouldn't want to read with Gerald and Piggy?!

We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to help students in need. We have academic clubs, after school tutoring, Saturday school, and daily academic pull-out programs. These additional programs have helped our students, and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut.

I plan on having my students view, research, and discuss various athletes and sports in flexible groups. They will discuss the need for daily exercise and the need for consuming healthy food choices. We will discuss and have a better understanding of the food pyramid. I have requested paper, markers, and mat frames. For the culminating activity, my students will draw themselves doing their favorite sport using the paper and markers requested. Some examples are: a gymnast, ballet dancer, ice skater, basketball player, baseball player, and swimmer. The finished pictures will be displayed throughout the school in the special mat frames requested. The pictures will serve as a visual reminder to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. Students will be challenged to make better food choices and increase physical activity. Since I teach in a Title I school, I am limited in resources and materials. I work with over 840 students, so materials are consumed quickly. Students will participate in groups researching, discussing and illustrating their favorite sports.

But that is not what defines my students!!! My students are bright young individuals who deserve access a thriving educational environment which is full of rich literature. I am building a new course which will focus on race and ethnicity and their meanings. We will explore their role in shaping our identities. The texts will be used to examine racial and ethnic inequalities in the United States, the nature of racism, discrimination, and stereotyping. My students will use these texts as an inspiration to explore their own race. They will first be able to read about others' experiences through their biographies, poetry, short stories and first-hand accounts. We will then have class discussions and write our own reflections about our own experiences both as they relate to the text and as they relate to our own roles in society. Text such as 'Letters to a Young Brother' can be used as open and honest inspiration as well as a starting point for discussions such as: why are these letters written? who they are written to? what do they hope to acheive? We will discuss authors' historical background and intended audiences for each work we explore. These text will bring exciting textures and and voices to our class.

I strive to provide my students with authentic, rigorous, and relevant experiences, with industry-accurate scenarios, to creatively solve problems, while gaining skills in financial literacy, teamwork, digital citizenship, communication, collaboration, critical-thinking, and creativity. While all my students receive federally funded school lunch, they are hard workers, who strive to do their best each day. My classroom is a student-centered learning environment. I set high expectations for my students, and most of them meet or exceed my expectations. I teach an amazing group of creative, innovative, and diverse future engineers. The vast majority of my students are from low socio-economic backgrounds. As they learn principles of financial literacy, it is my hope that they will share these with their families, and brighten not only their futures, but that of their entire family. I’ve heard it said, “If it’s not written, it didn’t happen”. I am not certain of just how accurate that statement is; however, I am certain that my students put forth so much effort, and produce great digital products, for their financial literacy projects. It’s a shame when we cannot print and display these for all to see. Being able to take home a printed copy of their budgets, charts, and other documents, to showcase their understanding of financial literacy, will make this project come alive, for my students’ families. Just imagine the sense of pride, ownership, and accomplishment my students will feel, when they take their printouts home to share with their families. For homework, students will teach an adult family member what they have learned, and together, they will describe one way the family can use this information to brighten their financial future.

I spent my first three years at a high school in Lawrence, MA teaching freshman English, and the past 9 years have been at another high school. I have a passion for urban education, and I participated in a cohort for urban scholars at Boston College where I earned my Masters in Secondary English Education. While teaching, I learned more than I have ever taught. My students are profoundly influential on my life, and I am so privileged to be able to teach these amazing individuals. I coached both novice and varsity crew for 6 years during the early part of my teaching career, before I had children. Currently, I run the outdoor adventure club which has about 85 students. This year we have gone hiking, snow shoeing, orienteering, and skiing. Teaching is my profession, but my students are my motivation and inspiration. I would like to take the course 'Writing for Children' so that I can explore the world in its' many plots. Stories for children, like stories for adults, come in many colors, from dark to light, and the best have in common archetypal characters, resonant plots, and concise, poetic language. The course I will take will use new and classic texts as inspiration, and we will try our hands writing in a variety of forms. This chance to write children's stories will serve as an inspiration and freeing spring board for me to explore writing in genres which will be used in my own classroom for creative writing and so much more for my own students. My students are yearning to move beyond the stifling essay and into the fanciful, and I am desirous to learn of ways to make this happen. I hope this course will give me a grounding to make this discourse possible.

My students are 2nd graders that have been accepted into the Gifted and Talented academy for our district. Being young and identified as gifted they should be challenged in academics and technology. Most of my students do not have computers at home, which means students need to learn about technology and resources in the classroom. Students learn how to work collaboratively with each other through online resources, but are also provided some opportunities to have fun on the computers. Children now a days, as well as adults, seem to be less active looking for a lazy way to do something. A lot of what needs to be done at school is sitting down and not being active and I want to change how students are working and learning in their classrooms.

As a technology teacher I can only teach so much basics, I rather teach them with data and activities they can interact with. Having students wear different types of pedometers and tracking using Google Sheets and write about it on Google Docs I can show more about the programs with their own data and experiences. Showing them how to use a program will not make them learn it, but having them do an activity about themselves in the program will help them learn and remember it. Having students wear pedometers will help them want to be more active and learn the appropriate ways to move and learn in class.

My students need more hands-on experiences, particularly with measurement in math and science. My students are curious and engaged learners who love learning with hands-on activities and games. Our school is in a high-poverty area and students often come with deficits in background knowledge, literacy, and real-world experiences. Our students love to come to school every day and take pride in their school and their learning. The most memorable and valuable lessons for them are ones that use real-world activities to connect to their real-life experiences. For example, having measuring cups will help students understand the concept of whole, half, and quarter when we follow recipes in math as a way to cement the concept of fractions. My students struggle to connect math and science to their daily lives--and across the curriculum. I had a student this year ask me why we were doing math during our science block! Measurement is an easy way to make those connections, yet students come to me with a poor understanding of concepts such as fractions, length, weight, and volume. Materials like a balance, scale, measuring cups, and thermometers will help us in our daily math classes and in our physical science units. We learn about weather and heat transfer, so the thermometers will aid in experiments measuring temperature. The scale will give students opportunities to measure the mass of substances before and after an interaction, and better understand the Law of Conservation of Matter. I will use the balance to help students understand the concept of balancing an algebraic equation so they can actually see and feel when you change the quantity on one side, you must adjust the other side to keep the equation balanced. For better or worse, standardized tests are a big part of public education. I know that having these measurement materials will help students dig deeper into math and science content, giving them a more firm understanding and helping them be more successful on tour End-of-Grade tests.

My students are struggling readers learning the English language. They are ESL students that are bright, but need books to spark that imagination and love for reading. I teach at an inner city school that lacks a large budget to help its teachers. Any help is greatly appreciated. I will be going into the classrooms with my selected books and begin the process of helping them increase their comprehension, fluency, and confidence. The types of books I chose to list in this project are designed to help a specific type of learner that needs visual clues. When a student is learning the English language, they use multiple skills to decode what they are reading, graphic novels help them and keep them engaged. Looking back on last year, students that weren't expected to pass the state reading exam passed. This success early in their lives provides self confidence to let them know that their economic status shouldn't be a barrier to the achieving their goals of learning.

I have been able to adapt our classroom, but recess is different. Our school doesn't have toys to meet their needs. All of my students, kindergarten through sixth, have severe special needs. They struggle to overcome hurdles their disabilities have given them, both academic and behavioral, but when they succeed, they shine. It takes specially trained staff, individualized curriculum, designed instruction, and adapted materials to teach my students. Work may be difficult at times but watching my students learn is worth every minute. With help, they can and will succeed. My students need folding rockers, a deck box with wheels, shade sail, chaise, outdoor rug, chimes, sensory balls, hammock, pails, bubble gun, paint brushes, ribbon wand, bean bags, bubble solution, chalk, and other outdoor tactile, kinesthetic, auditory, and visual toys and equipment to help students organize equipment. When the visual schedule shows my students that it is time for recess, many of them do not know what to do. With your generosity and donations, a student will have a chair to rock in instead of hiding near the steps of the classroom in a ball shape. A student will jump and giggle in the shade as a sun shade blocks the rays from their sensitive eyes. A student bounces on a ball with a smile instead of pacing back and forth not knowing how to play. A student calmly focuses on the soft sounds of chimes instead of the loud voices on the yard that usually cause him to cover his ears. A student is able to engage with a peer when blowing and popping bubbles when she used to stand by herself. The requested sensory toys would help my students meet their sensory needs and find enjoyment when outside at recess. They will learn how to play like and with their peers. With your help and donations, my students will have appropriate toys to play with at recess, that finally meet their special needs. When my students see 'recess' on their visual schedules, they will be excited instead of confused. I will teach my students how to play like, and with, their peers with toys they are familiar with, comfortable with, and adapted for their unique needs. Learning play skills will help my students make friends and integrate with their peers in a positive way.

My students now love reading and cannot wait to learn what we will be reading next year. These books will help me to continue to improve and get them ready. These are hands down the best students that I have worked with. They may have a rough exterior, but deep down they are super sweet and willing to learn. Over the course of the year, roughly 60% of my students made growth in reading according to our state assessments, and many of those who may not have shown growth were already reading above their grade level. They work hard every day to improve, and I have seen those changes not only in scores but also in their mindsets. They started out as a group that often disliked reading and would complain about it, but now they are constantly coming to my class, usually while I am teaching, in hopes of borrowing a new book or getting their novel so that they can read ahead. I want to continue that trend in my kids, and this project will go a long way to improve that. Some of these books will help the students directly, while some of them will help me to improve my teaching and thus impact them indirectly. The book that has the graphic organizers is something that will be reproduced for them. The bell-ringing book offers activities to help improve their reading and bring them some excitement. Some of the other books will help to improve their skills in non-fiction texts and informational texts, which is a key 21st Century Skill. My project will make a difference because it will improve the quality of my instruction, and by extension, allow me to better teaching reading. I already have won over the hearts and minds of my students and managed to change their views on reading.

The most engaging and meaningful learning that can occur for a student is when they are present and immersed in experiential study. As a teacher, I strive to create these individual experiences for students. Parkway Montessori Middle School is the first fully district supported Montessori Middle School in the state. We are a rigorous Title 1 school pioneering our way to greatness on the East Side of St. Paul!My students are, first and foremost, incredible young people! They are intelligent, funny, compassionate, and resilient! We are a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse school. Our demographic breakdown is about 30% African American, 30% Asian/Pacific Islander, 25% Caucasian, and 15% Hispanic. Our free and reduced lunch students make up 78% of our total population, with another 24% receiving Special Education services, and 31% being Multi Language Learners. My students come from a background as diverse as their demographics: single-parent households, lower-income, homeless, abuse, mental health issues, and other come with very little trauma to face. Honestly, many of my students struggle, some with the previously mentioned issues, many with academics. As students are studying Minnesota History in their social studies classes, teachers in English Language Arts are working to create cross-curricular units that are in alignment with the content students are learning about Minnesota History. As the destruction of the vibrant African American community of Rondo is an integral piece of St. Paul, Minnesota's history, reading the novel, Days of Rondo, will serve not only to engage and challenge students to use a variety of reading skills and strategies, but will also support the overall learning taking place in multiple classrooms. Students will use the knowledge they gain from reading Days of Rondo to support individual research projects as well as provide them authentic background prior to embarking on their field experiences within the present day Rondo community. During their field experience, students will be exploring the community they have read about and complete service projects for Rondo community members and organizations. Anytime students are able to personally connect with a lesson or unit, they are more engaged and thus, more likely to actively learn new information. As students read about the people and experiences of the thriving Rondo community, knowing they will have the opportunity to connect with some elders as well as exploring the impact of gentrification on the present day Rondo community and members, they are more likely to be critically thinking about, problem solving, and questioning these issues.

Through collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving is what they need to have to thrive in today's society. My biggest challenge in getting my students there is our lack of technology. My students represent 5 different counties in the Western Carolinas. Some families have chosen to commute long distances to be able to attend our school. I know a family that travels almost an hour very morning to drop there child off by 7:30am. They are excited and vivacious and eager to learn! But most importantly, they believe in our school. My school is a new school that opened August of 2014. It is a year round, collegiate prep school that believes in educating the whole child without the demands and anxieties of too much testing. The teachers are creative, energetic and has taught on very little resources, furniture or curriculum. Yet they are happy because they are also vivacious and eager to teach! Our school has built a community where everyone loves to be there and learning is rigorous. Through the use of the 8 Apple iPads and iPad protectors, my students will be learning Literacy Skills through technology. The Apple iPads will primarily be used inside my classroom through Kindergarten Literacy Center time where I will enforce their literacy skills through apps that enrich alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, reading and reading comprehension. With a splitter, each iPad will be used with 2 students at a time collaborating together to enhance these skills. The Apple iPads and iPad protectors will also be used for class intervention groups for at risk students in Language Arts and Math inside my classroom. The students will practice grade levels standards that are connected to the common core that they have particularly been struggling with. With this extra piece of intervention I will be able to guide our students to become more confident and successful in their educational career. '21st-century skills' is generally used to refer to certain core competencies such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving that advocates believe schools need to teach to help students thrive in today's world. Without the proper resources, a student will not have the 21st century skills needed to be a 21st century learner. Your donation will change this.

They make connections between Literature and Nonfiction, and what is happening today, in the real world. We debate, discuss, and infer together, and everyone is encouraged to 'show what they know'! Our school is unique because we are a public school but gifted, regular, and disabled students all attend classes together and there are lots of opportunities for cross grade interactions. It is normal to see students of all ability levels playing basketball with two students in wheelchairs, or a 4th grader teaching a 1st grader to sound out words, or how to design a catapult! Some 4th grade students visit 5th grade once a week because we do what is best for kids. We are an IMPACT Academy, that stresses Problem Solving and Positive attitudes, and as the front of our school announces, 'All students are welcome at Garden Grove!'. This year we will have 35 students in each of two fourth grade classrooms. We want to extend our Literature Circle book sets to include a Science Fiction genre (When you Reach Me), a realistic fiction (Because of Winn Dixie) and a Historical Fiction (By the Great Horn Spoon). Since we only receive about $100/year for books & supplies, these extra book sets, and art supplies of paint, pencils, paper and pastels are critical for our extension projects to provide readers additional ways to revisit what they've read, and continue the conversations and discoveries to create even more meaning. Game Boards, CD Covers, Character bookmarks, collages, ABC books, commemorative stamps, accordion books, paper story quilts and salt dough maps are some of the planned projects. Extra kids mean extra books and supplies needed! No one should be left without a book or art supplies! As more and more students are packed into our classrooms, we sometimes forget the power of one book-one student. While it is true students could share novels, there is something magical about curling up on the rug with your own book, reading at your own pace, and getting lost in that literary world for a while each day. These few extra sets of books mean one book/child . The art supplies mean there are enough supplies even for students who come from homes who cannot afford extras.

They've never truly found a book they are inspired by, or a book that offers a strong role model that makes them want to know more about themselves and the world around them. I want change! My traditional English students are in 8th grade and have tried to find many creative ways around not doing real work so that they can 'slide by' and not be noticed. They 'fake read' because they don't know who they are as readers and they no longer care about stories or the heroes that lay within the pages of a novel. I have a large percentage of energetic students curious about history. I have students with low reading scores who would never consider 'reading' on their top 100 hobbies of 'after school activities'. My school's largest demographic category is low social economic status. I believe every child can learn, but that they need the right tools. I believe that the adapted young adult book 'Unbroken' can be the very book that changes their reluctance into sizzling energy. Olympian Louis Zamperini spends a difficult 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. 'Unbroken' is the story about resilience of the human mind, body and spirit, and can give inspiration to students and teach them the value of perseverance. Students will engage in literature circles and will discuss the major events in small group settings. Students will not only write objective academic summaries, but will, but will cite evidence that proves Zamperini is a hero. Students will also draw inferences about the main character to support their opinion and establish a formal writing style by doing so. Overall, the book will inspire struggling readers to read more, and to write more compelling essays that challenge them to cite evidence and to use logical reasoning in their essays. If I can get one student to love this book, I may have perhaps caused them to become life long readers. If I can do that, I have created a critical thinker. I've helped create one more soul dedicated to becoming a stronger citizen all by having read a book about a tough American hero who refused to give up. I can get my class talking about historical issues, and real people who turned crisis into an opportunity to prevail. I believe 'Unbroken' is that one book.

My school is becoming an in-district computer science charter school to help further their opportunities. My students also get many chances to perform. Some of our performances occur at football games, pep rallies, and other events. My students will use the music lyres to hold their music while they perform. The woodwinds cannot hold their music and play at the same time because their instruments require two hands! The lyre clips the music close enough so the student can see it.

The represent over 200 students across multiple grade levels, and include students with a variety of learning disabilities, cognitive impairments, autism, and emotional disturbance. These students require increased opportunities to engage in high-level, real-world activities that are not typically in the science curriculum, to gain an opportunity to let their own interests drive their exploration of science, and to continue their exploration independently. In the classroom, students will be able to use 3D printing to design their own learning tools, such as 3D models, of molecules, cells, and structures to enhance their learning. Students will be able to use visualization applets, CAD programs, and 3D slicing software to create tools to explain concepts and demonstrate understanding of complex ideas, ranging from protein folding to covalent bonding to the best bridge design possible. Also, students in our after-school STEM extension program will be working on designing and producing relevant and useful commercial and educational products, enabling students to learn in a real-world environment the process of design and production. Rather than be passive receivers of information, both groups of students become active participants in both the development of their instructional materials, and in the market as a whole.

We play our instruments and learn about music the majority of the class- every instrument including, percussion, woodwinds, and brass are in my classrooms. My class is loud, fun, and creative! My students are passionate, intelligent, and hard working. They are usually not given much in life, but what they do have, they appreciate and take care of. They often come from inner city San Antonio, from extreme poverty, homelessness, or traumatic home lives. My school is becoming an in-district computer science charter school to help further their opportunities. At the end of the school year, my students will be mini-professional musicians. They will perform concerts for audiences of family and friends. The students will be able to offer constructive critique of themselves and their peers. The biggest challenge for our band students is mastery- practicing something everyday takes patience, persistence, and good collaboration skills. Our students often do not come in with these skills. The more tools I have at my disposal to catch their attention, the better my rate of success with them. The document cameras will be an invaluable tool for our band classes. My students will use the document cameras in the classroom everyday. I will use it to show them their music for the day, how to mark their music, how to finger notes, and to show them chords or other instrument parts that relate to what they are playing. The document cameras will allow me to reach every student in my classroom immediately. It is an unlimited, engaging tool that will allow them to becoming mini-professional musicians. Donations to my project will be an amazing contribution that will change the dynamic of my classroom. Students are automatically more interested in technology. I will also be able to do more, teach deeper, and make sure each student is seeing and marking what I want them to. The document cameras will make my students more successful, engaged learners.

Students are often engaged through play with the purpose of building a strong relationship between learning and personal experiences. Many of my students come from a Spanish speaking home environment. As a bilingual teacher it is my responsibility to continue building a base for their Spanish while simultaneously supporting them in their English learning journey. For many of these students, this is their first learning experience in the US, making it even more important that they have an outstanding experience that will form a base from which they can launch themselves forward into environments of higher learning. At the moment my students are using flipped cubbies as their book shelving and storage. It's not always convenient for the students since they cannot reach some of the books and materials. It's also not convenient for me since the cubbies tend to be taller than proper children's shelving which can obscure my view of the children while they are engaged in their learning centers. My students would greatly benefit from having furniture that is at their eye-level as well as on wheels. This will provide more movement for students to have while engaged in an activity. The library on wheels will allow students to move their classroom library to where they are stationed & select a leveled or themed book on their own. Birch Big Bins with set of bins will allow students to select required math materials independently to solve problems. Proper furniture will help the students reach the books on their own while promoting independence on their part and allowing me to monitor them with ease. My hope is that this project will help my students become more self reliant throughout the year by having access to their books and materials without needing our assistance due to height disadvantages. I hope to use the added storage to teach them how to stay organized and promote responsibility for maintaining a neat and clean learning environment.

One way students can do this is by determining what genres of books they like to read. Not all students will like the same type of books, so I must provide them with a wide range of genres. My students are from a small town, and the majority of their days are spent at school or childcare. They often spend time reading for school and for fun. Our school does not have a large library, so our classroom library is very important for our students. I will have a section of my classroom dedicated to the classroom library. I will keep all of these books in our library for students to read during the designated, in-class reading time. I will also allow students to check out books to take home for additional reading time. I am a first year teacher who is coming right out of college. I do not have the funds to buy these books on my own, but I do not want my students to suffer because I cannot afford them.

Our library media center is the ultimate haven for exploration-both within books and through hands-on learning experiences. I adore my job. Middle school is full of exciting challenges every day-from finding just the right book for an eighth grade boy who would rather eat a book than read it to collaborating with teachers in instructing teachers about information literacy. We are staffed with excellent teachers who are excited to try new approaches in order to engage students. The Makery, as our Makerspace is called, is an environment where students can explore concepts and ideas that are within and without the standard curriculum. With no grades assigned, students can explore freely on their own, or engage in enriching activities created by teachers. Through the use of Arduino, Makey Makey, and Snap Circuits, students will learn about programming and electronics. Through the use of Legos and K'Nex, students will investigate building. Through the use of a 3D printer, students will be able to take design and visualization to another level.

We need access to a large lab table for setting up equipment. It is also difficult to use equipment that requires washing or investigate dirty, fun activities because we can't wash our hands. My hope is for students to be exposed to fun, challenging investigations using proper science materials and equipment. We don't have access to water in the classroom. With a mobile lab table and portable sink, my students will be able to perform messy and engaging experiments, wash hands and clean equipment in a safe manner without leaving the classroom. Science students should learn the importance of safe lab behaviors such as cleaning hands and equipment.

We reject the one-size-fits-all educational construct and focus on social, emotional and physical well being as well as academics. Having iPads in the classroom will allow us to create centers where students can take turns 'playing' on educational applications at their own personal ability levels. They will also have access to a variety of books beyond our limited classroom budgets. Teachers can also set up specific WebQuests with a list of URLs so that students can research specific topics on their own without being exposed to search engines.

Being able to love reading can open a person's mind to things they never knew and I believe that every student deserve the opportunity to have that experience. Our school is very diverse, therefore we have many students that come from different backgrounds. We have a lot of military families, low poverty and high poverty, single parent families or no parent families, homeless families, and a big population of Malti-cultural families. Because of this our school is extremely community and family oriented. We want to do everything we can to make sure every student is being included and feels safe and able to learn. One thing I have noticed is either students love to read because they have access to do so, or students hate to read because of their inability to do so. This inability can come from a lack of access to reading materials outside of the classroom. I want students to be able to use the kindles as another way to read books they love. I also would like to use the camera's on the Kindles for projects or QR Code's during in class assignments. I believe that it is important to have technology available at the students fingertips because that is where this generation is headed. My hope is for students to be able to access reading in a different and meaningful way with these Kindles. They will allow students with sight impairments and English Language Learners to read with a font that is best for their needs.

Nowhere is this more apparent than when young children are absorbed in a game that is actually teaching them the basics of computer coding. My students are bright and eager third graders that reflect the rich diversity of our community. We are a wonderful mix of racial backgrounds, home languages, and ethnic backgrounds. Approximately forty percent of our students receive free or reduced lunches. Although some of my students have access to computers at home, many do not. They are all eager but, even at third grade, it is easy to see the beginning of a developing digital divide. This iPad and keyboard will make it possible to set up a coding station in my classroom. The kids will be able to use applications that disguise the logic and skills of coding as familiar games. These games are highly motivating and teach students the basics of computer programming while fostering perseverance and problem solving. Since the interface with the iPad is so intuitive, students with very little computer experience will still be able to access the applications and develop coding and basic computing skills. Having an iPad with a keyboard to use as coding station in class will give all students equal opportunity to explore the critical beginning skills of computer programming. It will also help give all of my students familiarity and confidence with computing.

I want to expand my students' ability to do this kind of work this year but we need more Chromebooks. Our school is a microcosm of our community; our diversity spans culture, heritage, and socioeconomic status. Half of my students qualify for free and reduced lunch, which means their families are living below the poverty line. Our district continues to invest in technology opportunities and now all students have Google accounts and we use Google docs to share our work. We have recently upgraded our broadband, and teachers an take technology-focused professional development. However, we still do not have enough computers in the classroom. Currently, shared Chromebook carts are stored in the library and have to be checked out by teachers and moved from class to class. This is not only a waste of time, it is also disruptive to the teachers and students. We want to improve the technology experience for our students in the most efficient way possible, and having enough Chromebooks is a simple, cost-effective solution. My students will use these Chromebooks for learning across many disciplines. Last year, using the shared Chromebook carts from the library, we did research, wrote poetry, created Google slide show book reports, and used Khan Academy and Arcademics to provide individualized math instruction. With more Chromebooks, we can reach more individual students and increase the amount of learning happening in our classroom. This DonorsChoose grant is part of our school's overall strategy to utilize a variety of funding sources to achieve our goal of a Chromebook on every student’s desk.

Math needs to be hands-on and active. Children need to work together to solve problems and persevere. Gifted math students need to be pushed and challenged. Our school is in Clark County, Ohio. We are classified as a 'rural fringe' school. We serve about 950 students in our Elementary, grades pre K-6. 42% of our elementary students are low income and we are a Title one school. My students have been identified as gifted in Mathematics. They come to me every day for their math instruction. They are so much fun. They love to learn and still get excited about new activities. I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I would love to have Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They would also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. Students could build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class will inspire teamwork, encourage perseverance, and promote a positive attitude towards solving math problems. Learning to persevere through problem situations is invaluable to my students. For most of them, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy.

Creating a multi-genre classroom library with popular books is what I'm hoping will be the key to unlocking a life-long love of reading for my students. I have the best students in the whole world! OK, well I am admittedly biased. While they are not the highest socio-economic level, they are hard working and goal oriented. Most of my middle school students want to go to college and work toward that goal. Many of the parents have a college background, and those that don't work hard to keep their families comfortable. Unfortunately, we don't have a great local library and parents don't always have the opportunity to take their kids to the library to get the books that they want. Our school places literacy development very high in our academics and we want our students to improve their reading levels each year. We have a designated 30 minute period 4 times a week where students are expected to read to work toward this goal. Our district has had a multitude of budgetary woes in recent years and one area that has been hit hard is in our libraries. We just don't have the number of current books available to meet the students wants. I can't wait to stand at my bookshelf with a student and have a conversation with them about books! Often times a student will not know what to read and I have to fly somewhat blindly when suggesting books that they may enjoy. With a well stocked library we can actually look at, pick up, and peruse through potential books to read. Students participate in book talks weekly, which helps others to add to their queue of next books to read. If I have many of these books available to the students it would help to increase the number of books that they read. Furthermore, we are going to be having Literacy Circle units this year where students will read multiple books from a specific genre. This allows student to have thoughtful talks and discussions on specific genre traits, theme and plot development, as well as how characters and setting work to move the plot and theme along. Kids need to have books available to them if we are going to ask them to read. The flip chart easel and Post-It notes will also help. Not all kids are readers. Often kids 'hate' reading because they haven't found the right book(s) for them. If students have a variety of genres, subject, and lengths of books I am confident that this can help to tear down the 'I hate reading' wall. I've seen students blossom when they have a chance to talk to their peers about books.

We also have a number of English language learners, which make it really important to provide them with learning experiences where their ability to speak English isn't as important as being able to create a visual image of what they want to say. We will use the ipads to create a number of movies, which will include book trailers, safety tips, bullying information videos and original stories. They will use a huge amount of critical thinking as they learn to create visual stories; the elements of a good story, the analysis of what makes an effective movie, character development, the way a shot is framed, creating the right mood by using the right music, the editing, etc. Using technology provides opportunities for my students to participate in learning 21st century skills. They have limited access to technology in their home life, so it is critical that they have the opportunity to use technology at school. They also need to learn how technology is more than just a phone or texting device.

All of the students want to learn, develop relationships with their peers and teachers and continue to become college and career ready. Sometimes the anxiety and stress related to school can become overwhelming to some students. The materials I am requesting will allow me to work with these students to reduce their stress and anxiety, develop coping skills and techniques to better manage this stress and anxiety. The Punching Ball/Rubber Emotional Punch Balls will be used to help student identify their feelings and emotions. The different fidget toys provide students the opportunity to focus their attention on the teacher or task at hand rather than their anxiety. The Yoga cards will be used to teach relaxation techniques to identified students struggling from anxiety or anger. The deep breathing helps prevent and reduce anxiety while also teaching students a wonderful coping skill. When a student is able to focus on their task rather than their anxiety, they perform better and develop a stronger sense of self-efficacy. This helps foster a passion for learning and long lasting positive affect. If the students can develop these coping skills and identify tools and techniques that help reduce their stress and anxiety at the elementary level, they will not only enjoy our school more, but will also be more likely to stay in school longer.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life.

Students in my school often have stressors in their lives that we cannot imagine. Providing support to increase attention and focus will help them to access their program and be more engaged. The pay off is HUGE. A small fidget in the hands of a child, who cannot listen to instruction, may allow them to learn a key concept. Just like adults who like to doodle or knit while they listen to a TV show or lecture--children often need the sensory support of a hand fidget or manipulative. Also--the books!!!

Some of my children live in shelters, some on the floor of homes while their parents look for housing. Being read to is a luxury they only receive at school.

We have about 600 students in a 7th and 8th grade only building. I get to see on average 100 of them each trimester. With these new robots, students will be able to quickly and easily test out programs they've written. Most of the robots we currently use do not have working screens, and several of them have worn ports causing poor connections to motors and sensors. Being able to 'plug and play' will allow them to go further in their experimentation, and not only learn how the sensors work but also see what they see! With this knowledge I hope they will also be able to adapt their programs to compete in a classroom 'challenge' to see whose robot can navigate the maze. Technology changes at the speed of light. Having a new set of classroom robots will help my students keep up with the ever expanding field and give them an edge as they continue their education.

This year I started teaching a new program for Algebra 1 called Intensified Algebra designed for students who have struggled in math. In order to be successful in this program, students need to have graphing calculators. Please help us be successful! My students are freshmen and sophomores in high school who have struggled in math and never passed a math class. Now that they are in high school, and math is a must in order to graduate, they are struggling as they don't have the foundational math skills to pass a math class. This course is designed to help solidify their basic math skills as well teach them all of the Algebra 1 skills needed at the high school level. These students are with me for two periods in a row (110 minutes) to maximize the content that we cover. Over the course of the year, we will cover foundational math skills from 6th, 7th, and 8th grade, as well as the Algebra 1 skills needed to move onto geometry. Many of the lessons in our curriculum require students to have graphing calculators. These lessons teach the students how to use different components of the graphing calculator. Our school has graphing calculators to use, but they are for students in higher math classes. Many of my students don't have the funds to purchase graphing calculators so teaching these lessons has been a challenge. It would be a huge benefit to my students to be able to learn how to successfully use a graphing calculator, instead of watching my use one under the document camera. My students have lacked confidence in math their entire lives. The curriculum I am teaching from is really helping to provide my students with skills and confidence to go out and be successful. In order to get the most out of this program, my students need access to the correct tools. Providing them with graphing calculators with give them a little more confidence to be successful.

My students attend a high-poverty school. They come from low socioeconomic status families and many of them are first generation Americans or immigrants. Over 90% of the students are Latin American. The neighborhood surrounding the school is a high poverty area. My school has a medical focus and is a public magnet. My students struggle with motivation, especially in their math classes. They generally behind in math and my school continues to struggle in math testing. Many of my students could be the first in their family to attend college. They enjoy using technology but rarely get to use it in school. In general, my school lacks up-to-date technological resources to support student learning. My students need more opportunities to interact with mathematics through technology. Two iPads in our classroom at all times will allow them access to online resources. We are able to occasionally check out class sets of iPads for classroom use. However, there are no iPads available for me to help facilitate lessons with technology. Our students use them to interact with math through various online software, specially an online graphing calculator. By having our own iPads in our classrooms, we can use them for demonstration purposes when we do have the class sets. Our students can also use these iPads on days when class sets are unavailable. This will also enable me, as a teacher, to expand our teaching toolkit by finding new online resources and applications that can enhance our students' learning experiences. This project will help enhance our students learning experience in our classes. We expect that, with our help, our students will be able to make use of technology to help them visualize and understand mathematics at a deeper level. They will grow their appreciation and love for mathematics and will understand how technology can be used as a vehicle for mathematical exploration.

My students will use the paint to examine their own skin colors in relation to those around them. We will mix the paint and paint our own skin in order to spark conversation about color and language around race. We need tape and glue to create our projects which include dissecting advertisements, building presentations around tolerance, and other hands-on alternative assessments. Students will enter class with their senses stimulated with relaxing lavender. This is a proven method of relaxation and tension releasing. Students will be encouraged to read and have small conversations in my 'library' area of the classroom. This area is already rich in books, but we want to build a room within a room with a sofa. I will use the requested books to help inform my lesson planning, and pull out excerpts to share with students. The donation of these materials, will help add to the enrichment and feel of our classroom.

These are just a few words that describe the Academically Talented students I get to work with each day. These students are excited about learning and would love to have the opportunity to take their learning to the next level with a 3D printer. The seed of a 3D printer and a makerspace was planted by last year's Academically Talented teacher. Now, the 8th grade class, in their last year at the middle school, would like to make a 3D printer a reality in the 5th through 8th grade Academically Talented program. Eager to learn, discover, and create, the students are also excited to be able to design, code, print, and ultimately hold their own ideas in their hands. Before even receiving a 3D printer and just by creating this project, the students are learning about planning and marketing. The students began with researching 3D printers in order to determine the best printer to meet their needs. As they develop this project together, they are also working as a team to market and spread the word about this campaign so that it is successful. Once the students have received this 3D printer and filament, so many more opportunities will be open to them. From learning to code and design their own projects and inventions, to the problem-solving, and persistence required to refine their projects, the students will be able to develop the hands-on learning experiences needed to increase their STEM awareness and 21st Century Skills that are so necessary to their future. Our goal is to make our ideas and projects come to life with a 3D printer. The addition of a 3D printer to the Academically Talented program will allow us to actually apply our learning in real ways, rather than just through discussion or writing. This 3D printer is not only for us, but for all of the current and future students in the program. We are leading this project not only for ourselves, but for the younger AT students as well. We are not only researching and typing up this campaign, but we are planning a media campaign within our school and community to create awareness for our project. This project is important to our school and community because it will provide us and the younger Academically Talented students with a multitude of opportunities that were not available before. We will be able to learn about coding and project design as we become the engineers. And while we, the 8th grade class, will be gone in a year, what we have done for the AT program will not.

Elaina wants to be a nurse, Stevie, a cosmetologist, and Josiah want to work in the automotive industry. They are currently taking human anatomy class or chemistry class. The students are interested in having a 3-D printer in the classroom because they believe it will help them understand science concepts better. They are visual learners who need to see and touch items to help them better comprehend material. They like the idea of a 3-D printer because they will be able to design models, such as bones or molecules, and then be able to print it. This project will help the students build skills necessary for their careers. One academic skill they will develop is the ability to analyze scientific models. Standardized testing often uses models and the students must answer questions about them. If students can design and analyze their own models, it will help them understand other kinds of models. In addition, students will work together to use the printer. They will have to develop communication skills to help each other design a model. They will also have to communicate to others when they explain models. We want to get a 3-D printer to help us with science class. We would be able to see what we're learning about in 3-D. The 3-D printer will help us to develop our study habits and improve our test grades because we can take the models to our dorm to help us study. We would be leaders by showing our models in science fairs so we can teach others about science. We could teach the other students and staff how to use the printer. Other people might see our models and be interested in buying a 3-D printer for their classroom and students. The printer will help us to become motivated. We could see and touch the models and we wouldn't have to only look at pictures. If we have the 3-D printer, other students would be fascinated to join the science classes. We, as deaf students, are more visual learners so it would benefit us to use the models from a 3-D printer because we'd be able to interact and be able to touch it and see it in more depth.

My school is a K-8 option school in our district that parents choose for their children. As an alternative school we attract students with a wide-array of learning styles, interests and backgrounds. We have many students who are diagnosed with Autism-Spectrum Disorder, Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD. My students love learning, but many of them still have difficulty staying focused during instruction and work times. Sitting for hours a day can be not only challenging for some kids, but can actually negatively impact their ability to focus. My special needs students in particular need to be able to move their bodies to be able to focus. Wobble chairs are designed to support children with ADHD and Sensory Processing Disorders because the chairs offer a physical challenge that provide sensory input as well as give students the opportunity to release extra energy while doing their schoolwork. Students also need to be able to listen during instruction. Fidgets that keep hands busy are proven to help students with ADHD focus. Having different seating choices that allow for movement will give my special needs students who need it a tool that assists them with their focus. Fidgets will help them focus during instruction.

Our elementary school is a creative arts magnet school in an urban district that uses interdisciplinary teaching and daily arts instruction to positively affect all students in the school through hands-on, interactive learning experiences. In our overall school population, 81% of our students qualify for free/reduced lunch. Our 5th grade classroom has students from diverse backgrounds and experiences who are bused to our school from all over the city. The students are highly motivated to learn but they have a wide range of learning needs. In our classroom, we have 30 students of which 41 % are English language learners from El Salvador, Mexico, Ethiopia, Somalia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Additionally, 6% of the students have IEP’s (individualized educational plans) because of identified learning difficulties. Increasing our ability to use technology for learning opportunities will allow students to work at their own pace on meaningful activities, no matter what their needs may be. Our district has made a commitment to using iPad technology to provide student-centered learning opportunities as well as increasing student engagement. We will have a number of educational apps that will allow students to work at their exact level. Each student in our class will be using an iPad to gather, process and communicate information. In order to maximize this technology enriched learning, my students need additional resources to use with our iPads. Individual headphones are essential when students are working on their individualized learning plan using iPads. Students respond best to interdisciplinary teaching that involves hands-on interactive experiences, so these additional resources will allow my students to reach their learning potential and demonstrate their learning in unique ways. By donating to our classroom you will make a huge difference in these students' lives.

5aec01deea590a26ee1d29dcfafac67a,Help us get Wild at Ramblewild,"Riedana and Valentina jumped to action when I presented this project to them! They are two of the Outdoor Adventure Club class officers, and they want to make this year's trips 'the best ever!' I was amazed at the way in which they developed the project. All the officers of the Outdoor Adventure Club stayed late after one meeting and brainstormed all the trips they would love to take, but we simply can not afford. Once someone hit on the idea of going on a zip line, everyone was talking at once. I told the students about Ramblewild - an outdoor ropes and course with obstacles that meander from tree to tree at various heights through the forest. Two students took the lead. I gave them the questions from DonorsChoose, and they worked collaboratively over google Docs. to create the project. Ramblewild will give students the three hours helping each other climb through the trees to strengthen their bond and their belief in their own abilities. It is an awesome way to teach teamwork – all while challenging their limits in the outdoors! Students cannot maneuver from one obstacle course to the next by themselves. They must rely on each other to map out routes, plan each method of traversing the course, and stick together. This will require empathy for one another and group problem-solving as the courses can be quite difficult. Students will learn about sustainability. The 10-acre adventure park is owned by Feronia Forests, a corporation which encourages landowners to develop sustainable income opportunities, rather than using their land to harvest lumber. Ramblewild is an Eco-friendly adventure park high in the trees of a hemlock forest. All of the elements of the park are attached to the trees using tension, rather than bolts or screws, so the trees remain unscathed. Project Help Us Get To Ramblewild is about attracting teenagers who are not invested with nature and introducing them to it in an exciting and heart-pulsing way. Ramblewild is the trip that is the medium between being completely away from society and being a city kid. By writing this grant, we are taking a step forward as leaders by partly funding the adventure and becoming more beneficial members to the club. With the help of our fellow officers, we will facilitate a means to getting the job done efficiently and elegantly. News of this trip has already peaked the interest of many teens. The club does not sell itself to everyone. For most teens, any time away from modern luxuries is like a detention. We want to show teens the joy of nature and the connection we once had with it. We want to share the feeling of accomplishment from scaling mountains and many other things while doing it all together! The group’s main focus is to build a unified community inside the school of which we can all have at least one great memory in nature together.

My job is to help them in every way that I possibly can. Imagine my frustration when I was trying to show them where they live in the state and I didn't have a map, globe, or computer to show them. They couldn't see the scope of the world that I was trying to get them to see. We had an inflatable globe, but unfortunately, some students got too excited and pop went the world. My students would be able to use the globe to see where many places are. When I read them stories about the grasslands or the North Pole I will be able to show them where those places are located. The grammar book will reinforce the daily grammar lessons that I am teaching them. We are also in desperate need of crayons. Most of the ones that we had are broken and almost useless. The students use the crayons to color their various projects that I assign to them. These donations will help my students 'see' the world. The lack of technology limits my ability to show them where they live. If I could show them on a map, I would. Unfortunately, our class lacks the roll up maps that are usually found in classrooms. The crayons are needed for the various projects that we are doing this year. Markers are too messy for them to use. The grammar books will show them how to use grammar the right way.

With TNReady and MIST being in full swing this year, I want my students to be as prepared as possible to take the test on-line. The school has a recent reputation of failure, but the students work hard every day to prove the naysayers wrong. While they all show interest and ability, over half of my students come to class each day unprepared to learn mathematics. Though they come unprepared, what they soon realize in my class is that math can be fun and interesting if taught the right way to fit their interest. My students' main interest...technology and using it in the class. My students generally love my class because of the different avenues used to teach them. With the use of an iPad, it will allow me to differentiate even more! The iPads that I am requesting will be used to allow students to be able to determine an appropriate course of action in solving various Geometry problems. TNReady is based on letting the students work through situations based on questioning and answering and discussing different ways in solving a problem. I feel that an iPad not only allows the students the opportunity to become familiar with the test and how it works, but also it is a fun and easy way to learn math with the many apps that are available. In order for students to be successful in the work force, they need to be able to think analytically, have a creative and innovative mind, USE TECHNOLOGY, and have the curiosity and imagination to take them further. These skills can all start by using an iPad to manipulate problems and how the outcome changes just by touching the screen.

Receiving round tables for our classroom will allow my students endless opportunities to complete individual and collaborative activities daily. Putting the fun and love of learning back into the classroom is the ultimate goal of every teacher. Over the years I have watched the kindergarten curriculum increase in its educational requirements as the common core standards for students leaving kindergarten have soared to very high heights for our youngest learners. The curriculum lessons and expectations for reading, writing, and math, provide little time to focus on the importance of the 4C’s of learning (collaboration, cooperation, creativity, and communication). My goal is to provide my 24 students with every opportunity to engage in the 4C’s of learning by providing them with collaborative furniture and creative learning materials that will guide them through their educational journey in a positive and caring way. Our youngest learners are eager to learn, I simply want to design a positive learning environment that will help make their educational journey enjoyable. Adding round spacious and comfortable tables to the classroom will allow the students to work both independently and collaboratively. Students will have their own space to keep their materials better organized which will help make their learning endeavors more productive and successful. In addition, the round collaborative feel of the tables will also allow many opportunities for the students during group activities to communicate with each other and create collaborative projects. As an educator, these tables will give me the opportunity to monitor my students more efficiently and effectively during both individual and group time activities.

The students have big dreams and have very unique talents and personalities. Some of my students have recently moved to the area from different states and countries, so they are making new friends and are adjusting to their new surroundings. I noticed that without a PE program in our school, the students do not have the chance to interact and build teamwork outside of the classroom. My students need basketballs, footballs, and team equipment to foster teamwork and community. I believe with the sports equipment the students will learn how to work together, value each other, and cheer each other on. In today's era, children are socializing and exercising less. With these sporting goods, the students will not only be healthier but will foster special friendships!

I work with students in grades K-12 that have serious medical issues such as cancer. They all live in high poverty areas. It is a joy and a privilege to work with these students. Some students have life threatening conditions such as cancer. Other students are on the transplant list waiting for an organ transplant. A few students have been hit by a car or were in a car accident. Most of the students experience pain on a daily basis. All of my students are very brave and are a pleasure to work with. In addition to their serious medical problems, all of my students reside in high poverty areas. Most of my students come from single parent families. The families are in need and spend a majority of their time taking their children to medical appointments and to the hospital. My students need a laminator, art supplies, paper, various writing materials, and mailing envelopes so they can create projects to share with others in the world. Our school lacks basic supplies. With these supplies the students will be able to use hands-on learning in their lessons. Students will create projects, mail them and share them electronically with others around the world. They can post them in the hospital to bring joy and encouragement to others! Since my students are under a great deal of stress and most of the students have chronic pain due to a serious medical conditions, integrating art and hands-on learning into our academic lessons is necessary. Project based learning helps students develop critical thinking skills. The families love to see the books and projects the students' create. Laminating the projects helps families battling cancer save the students' precious work forever! We share the projects with the community and families. We create research presentations. This helps to develop students' critical thinking and analysis skills. We integrate math, art, technology, english and science concepts. Students create sophisticated writing and research projects.

Relationships with my students are just as important as teaching them the academics. Students in my classroom are met with a rigorous curriculum that includes readers workshop, writers workshop, shared and close reading. Our school is a title 1, reopening school. We have a really high population of ELL students and our resources are extremely limited. We do not have enough books for our classroom library and we are limited on the copies we can make, so printing them from reading a-z is difficult. I have a wonderful group of students who have been developing a love for reading and writing! They enjoy reading nonfiction texts on animals and they love to write small moment stories. They are an interesting bunch because they do not have the behavioral problems that other first graders display. They are attentive and hungry to learn more and more everyday which not only brings me much happiness but also a bit of sadness when I don't have all the resources to make their learning experience all the more significant. Since 98% of the students in my classroom are ELL's, they require a lot of visual aids. They also need interaction with different texts because their background knowledge is so limited. I want to use the classroom storage cubbies as a writing center. I want students in my classroom to have a place where they can both access and store their writing and writing materials. The Luna camera will allow me to model close reading and the ways we mark up our text, all without having to walk around to each student and show them the book. It will save time and allow the whole class to move through the lesson together. The books will provide students with better opportunities to book shop and to be exposed to different literature. Students will also be using these books as they move through future reading units as well. This requires them to do some research and gather information on a specific topic. These books will open our classroom to more topic options. First, I thank you for considering this project and taking the time to read my requests. Our students were uprooted from a school that was overpopulated and placed in a reopening school where they have dealt with flooding, broken heating units, and a lack of school supplies. With your support, my students will be better equipped and encouraged to read and write in an environment that fosters learning. They will have the tools they need to meet and exceed the rigorous academic requirements.

They are so proud of what they have accomplished and I am so proud of them too. It is their goal to get their intricate piece of fiber art on the Wall of Fame. My K-5 school is a great place to be. I am surrounded by resilience and creativity everyday. My students inspire me. I am the only counselor in a K-5 school so I keep VERY busy. My students are very motivated but many struggle with getting basic needs met at home. 100 percent of them get free lunch and most of my parents work nights or two jobs to make ends meet. In addition many do not speak English or very limited English and many are refugees. I deal daily with the kind of problems that stem from not getting basic needs met. In the midst of all this I help children express themselves in ways that help them to build a core sense of self. I learned a long time ago that a young child is likely to be more comfortable initially expressing him/herself with art than he/she is going to be at expressing emotions and feelings through words. I stay in at recess and after school trying to keep up with all the needs of my students and after 11 years I still truly love it. Because many young children are more able to express themselves through art and play, I have a lot of art materials in my office. The sewing materials are by far the most popular, with the boys and the girls and I cannot keep up the with demand for supply. A large part of a child's development is being able to be creative and learn how to express themselves. Art therapy such as sewing and embroidery gives children the opportunity to do both in a safe environment. Some common art therapy goals for young children are sensory awareness and integration, problem-solving skills, identification and expression of feelings, and increased self-esteem. At a very young age, children start to develop self-esteem. Mastering a skill such as sewing and embroidery can help to increase their self-esteem and feel more confident. My students crave the soothing effects of art. Being able to provide them with the materials they need to be successful in this medium will increase their ability to develop a new skill that will help increase their self-esteem.

My kids thought that having our own Chromebooks in the classroom would be beneficial for those times that the Chromebook cart is not available to us.

The paper will be used by my students to draw their favorite part of a classical selection of Peter and the Wolf originally by Sergei Prokofiev in 1936. It is a children's story consisting of music and text, spoken by a narrator and accompanied by the orchestra. My students have not had this type of exposure in the arts. Students will listen to the following instruments from the selection: flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, timpani and bass drum. Peter represents the string instruments: violin, viola, cello, and bass. The Wolf is French horns. They will draw an animal or feeling from the selection with the paper requested. We have been discussing musical instruments in the classroom, so this unit will have meaning. Students will see the video of Peter and the Wolf. Many of my students do not have exposure to classical music. They are not familiar with many instruments that are needed for orchestra.

Three major industries in our area closed down over ten years ago but the families remain loyal to our school and area. We are over 70% below the national poverty level. My students are eager, capable, and willing to try new things but because of our location and the lack of industry in our area, are limited in resources needed to keep them on a level playing field with their peers in more affluent communities. Our 21st century students will be designing and programming all kind of robots from residential service robots to commercial robots in their lifetimes. The hands on learning robotics and technology materials requested here will be made available to all students at Maker Space Centers in the library. These stations will allow students to directly interact with coding and robotics and newer technologies. Our students will learn analytical thinking, critical problem solving, computer programming, math and engineering skills all while being creative. These hands-on STEM materials will be essential to Create, Build, Learn, Explore and Play utilizing the core components of STEM.Our students love anything that they can work 'hands-on' with and that is technology based. Having a place in the library where groups or individuals can collaborate together or work independently is what I hope to accomplish by this Full STEM Ahead project.

Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. Many of my students come from poverty stricken areas and households. This is the single factor that most of my students have in common. We are about 85% free and reduced lunches. Many come from violent environments, broken and unstable home environments. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. When I get my students in 9th grade the majority have not had an art class since they were very young. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school.

My students tend to extremely empathetic to others and we pride ourselves in being heavily involved in our community! With the addition of foam and foam cutting tools my students will be able to design and build light weight puppet bodies. Having a designated tool box for the puppet building class will aid in my students being able to engineer and build props and puppets. We will utilize the clay and clay tools to sculpt heads and body parts for molding and casting. We will utilize heat guns for softening thermoplastics to be used to create masks and puppet heads. Through the process of puppet building and performance my students learn techniques in painting, sculpting, casting, mask making, prop building, music and sound design, anatomy, movement, lighting, set design, acting, choreography, teamwork but also STEM skills (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). These skills transfer into many disciplines and potential job opportunities. We are making professional quality puppets in our class. This means that we use professional tools and supplies that can get expensive. We have some financial support from our school system and PTSO but adding these extra items will create a thriving environment in the room.

I will start with a story called 'I Like Me' by Nancy Carlson. It's a wonderful story about liking yourself and focusing on your best qualities. We will have a classroom discussion about the book. Students will be directed to make connections from the story to art and health. It helps promote positive self-esteem, healthy eating, and healthy choices through art. After the story, students will be given a mirror to study their facial details. I will show them the proper technique of creating their clay faces in proportion for this unit. Students will learn the technique of scoring when placing facial details of the eyes, nose and mouth on the oval clay face. Once the air dry clay dries, students will get to paint their faces using the acrylic paint requested. There are many colors for the students to choose with these paints requested. Using a story, this unit focuses on having a positive self-esteem, making healthy food choices and decisions with daily living skills through art. Students will learn proper techniques of pinching, rolling and scoring through a medium of clay. Students will get to paint their self-portraits using acrylic paints. This unit is needed for my students since many of them come from single family homes. They have limited exposure to clay and this will help build self-esteem.

They have already been brainstorming of all the many ways they can put these tablets to use, and I have been impressed! I asked them what they would love to have available to them on a daily basis in class that they do not already have? I put them in groups to collaborate on this topic. Each group came up with some ideas, then had to persuade their classmates to support them. After every group presented their idea, the class overwhelmingly agreed with the group that thought of Kindle Fire Tablets. I have many students in class who depend on their love of reading to help them learn about the world outside of our small South Arkansas town. Having easy access to the Internet and especially thousands of books to download will allow them to expand their worldly culture, and learn about themselves in the process. I am eager to use the video capabilities available on the Kindle Fire tablets, to allow my students to work collaboratively on projects to present to their fellow classmates. I feel they will learn about the content I want them to learn about while also learning about teamwork and technical skills at the same time. Megan- I am an avid reader, and I often get discouraged at the selection of books available to us in our library. I would be thrilled to select my next book from the Amazon store. I know that many of my fellow classmates would agree with me. Bailey-I have a lot of big ideas about presentations that my classmates and I can work on together if we have the technology that this tablet could provide us. This could help make learning more accessible and interesting. Katie-I hope to start a book club with my classmates for the new books that we will have access to through the use of these tablets. I am hoping that Mrs. Matthews will allow us to meet in her room some days during lunch to do this. Adam-I want to use the tablets to start a video blog for our class to think more about what we have learned. This could be a much more exciting twist on our traditional Writer's Response Notebooks. This project would give all of the students at our school the chance to read books they may not get to read without these tablets. Our small town residents can be exposed to books not currently available in our library. I can hardly wait to discover even more exciting ways to use these tablets in our class that we haven't even thought of yet!

The are now eager to take these projects to the next level - from simple 3D objects to programmable, functioning robots using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. From the day they started working with the 3D printer, my students have been brainstorming what they can print and make. Printing simple objects has been interesting, but they are eager to tackle more advanced projects and challenges. They have seen fully, functioning robots using 3D printed parts programmed with controllers like Raspberry Pi 2 and the Arduino Uno R3, and decided this was the next step they wanted to take. Through the combination of our existing 3D printer and the programming capabilities of the Arduino Starter Kits, my students will be able to learn and apply their knowledge of coding to real-world situations. They will be able to work cooperatively as a team, designing and printing the parts needed to construct their robots, and then program their robot to complete a task. According to Eric, 'Our project is to expand our engineering skills and our knowledge of electronics customization by obtaining two Arduino Starter Kits and two Raspberry Pi 2 Starter Kits. Combining our 3D printer with these kits, we can create a balanced, electronics driven curriculum that inspires ingenuity and opens minds to the vast world of robotics, programming, and the creation of objects that can change the world.' This project is important not only our class, but also to the classes and students below us. We understand that we will be leaving this school at the end of this year, but we also understand that this project will not only benefit our learning during our last year, but will benefit the younger students in the Academically Talented program. This project will solve the main obstacle we currently face with our 3D printer curriculum. We are able to print nice objects for projects, but we are not able to use those objects and parts to program working electronics and robots. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi will allow us that next step in our engineering learning.

My students come from diverse backgrounds and with many needs but a wide range of skills. They attend a large high school in Oregon, with a wide socioeconomic range. The average student-teacher ratio and minority rate is higher than the state average, and the graduation rate is lower than the state average. Since sports have largely been cut in the middle schools, my high school PE classes are some of the only opportunities they will have to play sports. My PE department recently added a new Recreational Basketball class as a PE elective. Since it has been introduced, the class has become extremely popular and is always fully loaded with students. Unfortunately, the equipment we have is substandard, and does not allow the students much opportunity to improve their skills. The balls we currently have are just rubber balls, and they go flat easily, get slippery, lose traction, and can get too bouncy. The basketballs I am requesting in this grant are known to be long lasting, have a good grip for dribbling and shooting, and are the official game balls many high schools use for their games. The ball bag I am requesting would also allow for a safe place to store the balls when not in use. Having new equipment would really help my students improve their basketball skills and allow this popular PE class to continue. These high quality basketballs will help encourage my students to live a healthy, active lifestyle and have a more enjoyable PE experience.

We are always working on a classroom environment where everyone feels loved, valued, and respected. They work hard at school despite some challenges that may be at home. A lot of my students come from the Flint area, which means that running water would be a luxury for them. My students have so much potential to make a big difference in this world, and we are trying our best, as a school, to help them see that. Our school not only cares for our students but also their family and community. Technology is sparse at our school because our Title 1 money is spent on interventionists because our students are coming to us way below grade level. We recently received one iPad from another DonorsChoose.org project, and my students have loved every second of it. If we could have another one in our classroom, we could double the students that could use it. We will be using the iPad in a lot of areas but really focusing on reading and math. My students will be reading a wide variety of books which brings the library to them. My students will also be building their basic math knowledge that is the foundation of math to come. My students like to know that people care. When I told them we had received an iPad for our classroom, they were so excited. I'd love to share that we got another one.

We all perform a warm-up together to get our minds focused on music. Then we learn a new music concept and apply it to our music that we are preparing for a concert. Our school is a 6th-8th grade middle school educating around 780 students. Our population is 91% Hispanic, with 92.6% Socioeconomically Disadvantaged and 39.1% are English Learners. In order to reach these EL (English Learner) students it is important to provide real, relevant and challenging music lessons to provide a well-rounded education where the arts are included in their everyday curriculum. Students will use their imaginations to create music which will help them with self-expression, problem solving, and collaboration. I admire Disneyland Create to INSPIRE my students. My students who play clarinet and saxophone will have the reeds they need to physically play their instruments. One reed only lasts a few weeks so for every student that plays a reed instrument, I need to provide around 10 reeds per year because I teach in such a high poverty location and I cannot ask my students to purchase their own reeds. The disinfectant is for my students that play trumpet, trombone, and baritone. They would use it on the mouthpiece to clean it and keep germs from spreading. With the worksheets my current and future students will be able to learn about famous composers and listen to compositions. Then they will be able to study musical terms and show their progress using the assessments in the book of quizzes. With the Finale program, I can create customized music for my future and current students to work on specific lessons throughout the year. Also anytime I need to rearrange music to work better for my students, I can easily create it using the Finale program. Students in my classroom will learn how to perform music on a band instrument for a hands-on education that builds individual and teamwork skills that will be helpful today and for the rest of their lives.

By removing some of the larger tables, and putting in the smaller desks, we can arrange the space so we have an open area where the kids can grab a pillow and read a book, play a game with friends, or just have a mini dance party! Our tables are heavy and bulky, and take time to push to the walls, losing either valuable academic time, or limiting the sensory break. Smaller desks will be easier to move if necessary, or by just taking up less floor space, we are going to create more of an open area. Working with students on the autism spectrum, it becomes necessary to create an atmosphere that is uncluttered. The open floor space allows for less congestion, and less distraction. Some of our students have executive functioning issues. Containing their things in the smaller space will help with their organization as well!

My students are a great group of kids who are all striving to reach academic success. The majority of my students are struggling readers who need additional support to help them reach success. I have a very diverse group of students that are all excited about school and ready to learn. We are in a low-income, high poverty area where the majority of our students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. A lot of students also have parents or family members serving in the military. My students are very supportive of one another and want to succeed within our classroom and within life. As a teacher, providing my students with additional items to support their learning, is quite expensive. This is why I am seeking out your help. With the two iPads we are requesting, we will use them to monitor students online and to access learning sites such as IXL and Raz-kids. These sites allow teachers the ability to see how students are doing and what they are struggling with. My students and I will both use these iPads to monitor their learning on these sites and provide assistance when needed. iPads are very portable and will allow use to move about the classroom freely to provide specific support each student. This project will help make learning fun, meaningful, and more engaging. It will also allow students to receive more specific and direct feedback from myself and other students within the class.

My students need engaging books and manipulatives that capitalize on their experience and interests. These materials will be used in our classroom library to help them practice their budding reading skills independently and with partners so that they can reach their reading potential. Kindergarten sets a foundation for school success. In kindergarten, many reading skills are taught, but children learn the best through hands-on activities and need books to read at their own levels. These leveled books and manipulatives will provide students the opportunity to practice their skills and learn to love reading! Students need access to engaging text that represents their own experiences, interests, and culture. Currently, our library is stocked with few books that reflect the students in the room. These new materials will engage our little readers so that they learn that books reflect themselves and reading is for everyone.

My students are middle schoolers in 4th though 8th grades. All are immigrants from other countries, are learning English, have relocated to an inner-city urban area, and are in an over-crowded school. Most of them are Spanish speakers, and come from families who have limited or no English speakers as well. Most students come from low-income families and qualify for free lunch status. The literacy skills with which they arrive to school vary from very beginning to highly developed. They are still expected to read and keep up with the classroom curriculum, however, and this is very difficult to do in a language they are still in the process of learning. My students are eager to learn and wish to adapt to the culture and language quickly. This is why I need to provide them with access to quality literature in a language they understand. My school district has frozen budgets, which means I am very limited as to what I can purchase for my students, though they need instructional materials. Students will utilize these books to check them out for independent reading, as nightly reading is required as homework. Independent reading at one's instructional level will develop many reading skills, such as comprehension, synthesizing information, questioning, inferencing, summarizing, fluency, and accuracy. Additionally, independent reading will develop students' vocabulary, even in their native language, and this knowledge will transfer to and enhance their English acquisition. Students are often asked to respond to their reading in writing, and frequently they must refer to their texts, but if they cannot truly comprehend what they read because of a language barrier, they will not continue to develop any literacy skills at all because they do not have appropriate materials to use. Books for my students will improve their literacy dramatically, since I only have a modest collection in varying levels for 15 limited-English students.

973b5d9425693e383710675f201467b8,Give My Students More Time to Take on the Day!,"I am a reading teacher that teaches multiple grade levels. I teach 4th, 5th and 6th grade reading at a charter school in central Minnesota. Being a charter school, we lack a lot of the basic supplies you may find in a traditional classroom. Teachers need to be creative and flexible! As a teacher, it is my responsibility to provide for my students as best as I can. I spend a lot of time researching new ways to engage my students. Through the years, I have found one thing to be true; if you can make learning fun, the kids will be very willing participants! I try to do just that, each and every day. I think reading is like going on an adventure. In fact I tell the students this quote: 'A person who reads lives a thousand lives; a person who doesn't read lives only one.' I try to take my students on an adventure every day through our reading. Because we lack the funding of a traditional public school, sometimes we have to go without basic supplies and materials that you may normally find in a classroom. For example, we currently make due with very old and worn out pencil sharpeners. Because the students switch rooms, we take a lot of time in the morning making sure we are prepared for the day. An upgraded electric pencil sharpener would literally shave loads of time off our morning routine! We also do our best to stay as organized as we can. Our school is made out of an old hospital building, so our rooms are small. The kids do not have their own cubbies to keep important documents and homework in. Having those would also help us save time by keeping us organized and ready for both the school day and the evening at home. And every minute saved is more time we put towards reaching our academic goals! These items would literally change our everyday routines and give us more time for the important stuff like building friendships, discovering new ideas, and of course learning! Every minute we don't have to spend trying get a pencil sharpened or sorting through stacks of papers is a minute we can use to help these kids reach their potential, both in and out of the classroom.

Third grade is the first testing grade in our state. This will give them the freedom to move around more rather than just sitting at their desk all day. A little movement can really wake you up! My students are in third grade at a high-poverty school. They are wonderful students who love reading. They're also very active so they need movement to keep them engaged. I let them stand behind their chairs or sit on the floor to work, but I would love to be able to give them a comfortable place to sit. Flexible seating will offer this to them. My students will have the choice to sit where they would like. Right now, they stand behind their desks or sit on the floor to work. At the beginning of the year, or when I get the seating squares, Wobble chairs and exercise balls, we will go over how they are to be properly used and the expectations I have for them working in different areas. Student-centered classrooms are very successful and I hope this change will help my students become more focused and engaged. This will make a huge difference in my classroom! The freedom of choice, even for elementary students, is very powerful. They have control over something. Third grade is the first year they are tested and I see several of them struggling to focus.

Our small school is the hub of the rural area of our county. We are a Title I school which simply means that many students come from low income households. They are not always afforded the same opportunities as neighboring schools in our district. In our music classroom, we do not have any practice rooms for which students can go and focus on individual practice. Usually when students practice, they are distracted by each others practicing. Fortunately, our school sits on acres of beautiful land right next to the river. Students enjoy being outside practicing. The stand and chair cart will make it easy to transport equipment in and outside of the classroom Having a music stand and chair dolly will allow students to get more instruction out of the hour of class time we are allotted. It takes a lot of time for students to not only set-up their instruments and music, but to also carry their own chair and stand inside and out leaves a minimal amount of time to work at their skills.

Not every child speaks the same, but all students have the ability to communicate. For our active EC age group, we continually raise the bar, with the family's engagement, to provide quality, creative and meaningful learning opportunities. Our diverse preschool classrooms includes learners ages 3-6 years. The students in our program present an array of learning styles and learning needs. We have 4 blended and 1 specialized classroom, where children participate in regular preschool curriculum, and students with specialized needs and supports are assisted through IEP programming. Within our classrooms, approximately half of the students present with delays in the areas of communication: language production, language comprehension, articulation/phonological delays which impact speech intelligibility, and pragmatic language delays. Our students are learning, with adult supports, therapy, interventions, and peer modeling, how to improve overall communication skills. Within our classroom, you will observe students using their words, communication devices, picture boards, picture schedules, social language supports, prompts/supports to assist in sound production, while engaging in meaningful activities with their friends. By obtaining the grant materials, our learners will expand speech and language learning opportunities within their classroom environment! A literacy center, focusing on expanding students receptive, expressive and pragmatic language skills is being developed within each classroom. Access to the materials requested through the grant will provide consistent access and programming to activities which focus on expanding vocabulary, retelling stories, creating stories, describing items, follow directions, increase conceptual knowledge, and assist in question comprehension. Using hands on manipulatives with structured language tasks, in a designated location within each classroom assists the Speech Language Pathologist in modeling, sharing, and training additional educational staff for greater carryover and skill generalization. In addition, students learn and apply social language skills, such as turn taking and conversational exchange, to increase engagement skills with peers. Through generous donations, our classes will have consistent core sets of language materials to promote speech and language carryover activities within the classroom environment. Students will stay in their classrooms for push in therapy services, which will increase language carryover.

16b0cfb8387c377b82231e59b73bc554,Can You Hear Us NOW?,"This student-led project excites me because as the school's drama coach, I've known for a long time that our school needs a set of wireless microphones for school plays, presentations and productions. Tyler, Macy, Mandy, Hannah, Jaylin and John have researched and found the ones they want. My students developed this idea after becoming very frustrated during our last year's Christmas play production. The audience could not hear the dialog and were lost as to exactly what was happening on stage. Throughout the play, the two working wireless hand-held microphones were passed back and forth interrupting the flow of the program and becoming a huge distraction to both the actors and the audience. The students began asking why we couldn't purchase a set of wireless microphones and when met with the 'it isn't in the budget' reply, began searching for ways to fund this project themselves. I've used donorschoose.org in the past successfully and I pointed them in this direction. I will assist them in promotion of their projects, but as required, most if not all of the work will be performed by these talented 14 year old 8th grade students. Through working on this project, my students have definitely learned to negotiate and work within a team. They have learned to budget money and search for the best price and greatest quality product available within that budget they've set for themselves. In addition, they have learned to write persuasively, which is a huge part of the Writing Core Content of Studies for our state. The students identified the problem themselves, worked on a solution, brought their ideas to me, and then facilitated getting the request completed online for approval. I couldn't ask for a better team of kids focusing on a lost piece of education today... 'drama and the arts'. I'm pleased that the lack of microphones and audience enjoyment has led them to problem solve in real life and I am more than happy to help them in any way I can. If funded, they will also set a great example for other students who come after them with needs that are not met in the regular budget. We are trying to accomplish the acquisition of 8 wireless microphones for our school's program and play productions. Our goal is to raise awareness of the arts and be able to perform for an audience without worrying that our audience members cannot hear what we are saying. If this goal is met, I am sure my teacher will be more encouraged to direct more plays and programs. I think this will be a win-win situation if funded. The more art in a school the better I say! Tyler I plan to be a leader in this project by using social media and my contacts to 'get the word out' about our project. My teacher will assist me with this by typing our proposal and submitting the requests for approval. Once approved, I will work around the clock to keep my contacts and social media friends aware of our great need for wireless microphones at our school. I will also not only share myself, but ask everyone I know to forward the information in case just the right person sees. Macy This project will solve the problem of our audience not being able to hear us in a production without awkwardly handing a hand held wireless microphone back and forth during dialog in a play. In addition, we will feel more professional and not have to worry about dropping a microphone or forgetting a line in a play while passing the one microphone we have to another actor. We will most likely have more productions because they will be enjoyable to watch and perform in as well.

Some of my friends that were always focusing on anything other than their work or me are now able to wiggle their way to success! Knees, hands, feet...everything except the bottoms of my students are on their chairs! My kiddos have a serious case of the wiggles that is distracting them from learning. My students' homes are located in one of the most crime ridden zip codes in our city. Many of my students witness situations daily that a young child, or an adult for that matter, should never have to see or hear. Unfortunately, in their homes there is little or no value put on education. As dismal as many of my students' situations are at home though, they thrive in school. My school provides a safe and nurturing environment where children know they are loved and well taken care of. In return students put forth 110% effort each and every day. The curriculum is rigorous and the standards are high. They rise to the occasion. Our school is well known in the district for the high performance of our students. The first set of chairs were intended to be used for instruction during my small groups. However, I quickly noticed how well my students were able to focus during small groups. We immediately incorporated them into our everyday learning. The chairs have been an amazing asset to our classroom. Not only have they benefited my students with attention struggles, but also have provided a more comfortable alternative for a student that has hip pain due to sickle cell. I would like to add 5 more chairs to my classroom to provide even more alternative seating for my students! The first set of chairs were smaller. These are the same design, but are able to accommodate some of my taller friends! I am requesting the five chairs to replace the traditional student chairs in my classroom and provide an alternate seating option for my friends. These chairs are great for wigglers; the benefits of children being able to wiggle and move while they are working are numerous. The students I took on this year needed a lot of help! More than half my class started the year at a 1st-2nd grade reading level. They have grown SO much! As a class of 22 students, they have grown an average of 102 lexile points based on SRI! I need to continue to provide the best setting and instruction so they can be successful. The chairs will provide the best setting, literally, for my students. I can teach my heart out, but if they aren't focused they will not improve and be successful.

My students are special education third-graders, at a diverse Title I (about 70% of students are entitled to free lunch) community public school in Queens, New York. They have been diagnosed with Autism. My students are in a special ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) Horizon program. This program is In its second year at my school and I have the pleasure of working with these children in my classroom. There are presently 7 students in my self-contained class this school year. The purpose of the Horizon class is to help my students gain the necessary skills they need to be able to function in the general education environment, and to eventually be able to attend a class with general education students. Children love technology. Using an Acer Chromebook laptop would allow my students to use technology as a tool for learning. An Acer Chromebook laptop would give my students a very motivating opportunity to play educational programs where they would learn reading, phonics, social studies, science, and math skills. My special education students learn best in a multi-sensory environment. Playing educational games and reading books will give my students the motivation to read more and practice skills they may need help with. It would be wonderful to see an Acer Chromebook laptop in my classroom so my students can practice skills to help them increase their grade level skills that they presently struggle with.

We also have a huge focus on literacy and writing in our room. We are explorers, researchers, scientists, artists, and interested in discovery. My students are bright and interested in the world around them. We are in a very large title one, urban school. It is also a community school and our community is incredibly resourceful in providing for our kids. About 60 percent of our population is ELL so they come in with language barriers. I can walk my class to the community garden across the street or go to the public library and get them library cards. We work really hard as a staff to provide a loving safe place to learn for our students. I requested a sensory table because Kindergartners aren't all about sitting in chairs and writing long dissertations. What they are about is exploring the world. My coworker recently told me a story about her students using Magna tiles and one of them came to her and said, 'Hey, did you know that if you put two triangles together it makes a square?' We teach our shapes in drills, but the learning that we see through discovery is so much more valuable because the problem solving and the thinking skills develop along with the social emotional skills in Kindergarten. These students need to have resilience as they go through life and those are the skills that we can offer if we resist the skill and drill testing culture we are in and offer a balanced education that meets the needs of every student. Students will explore the alphabet in materials such as sand and water as part of our approach to balanced literacy. This project will make a difference to about 50 students as we are working together to team teach. Our students will get a better opportunity to explore materials and make discoveries on their own as well as converse and develop language skills as they negotiate in free play. It will ease the stress of two teachers to have the materials they need to make our learning environment more fun for our students.

They come from a variety of backgrounds, and we can all find common ground through good literature! I teach 3-5 grade gifted and talented students in a title 1 school in South Carolina. The students I teach are very capable readers, but oftentimes need help getting engaged in a book for the long haul! Each year the state of South Carolina publishes a list of books they recommend. My students love the challenge of reading all of the book nominees, and doing book talks or book recommendations to encourage others to read their books. Some even make it a goal to finish all of the books in the list over the course of the year. By having all of the books in our classroom library I will be able to give students a choice about which ones they want to read, and we will be able to pass them around as students finish. All of the the books on this list are quality literature, and they provide great talking points and discussion starters for our class. In addition, they encourage students to read something outside of their normal genre, because there are so many to choose from. In my classroom, these books will take center stage! They will provide a great selection of books for students to choose from. I envision students choosing a book, reading it at their own pace (with my checking in, of course), and doing activities with the books in order to encourage others to read their books. They will learn to do book talks, write book recommendations, and film videos/commercials to 'sell' their book! The funding of this project will make a huge difference for my students. It will motivate them to read, give them access to quality literature, and get them excited about sharing their reading. Gifted learners are good readers, but they oftentimes need that extra push/challenge to get them into a good book. These books will do just that!

Our students are required a minimum of 100 minutes of physical education. It is a challenge to maintain this requirement, without equipment that encourages them to participate in physical activity. Our school is located in a neighborhood that is high crime and high poverty. Introducing them to team sports would have an impact on their learning and behavior choices. With the equipment that I have requested, I can help create a structured physical education schedule. I hope to create stations where students can rotate through several team sports within the time provided. I would like to have a volleyball station, relay racing station and a soccer station. This would allow the students to experience different levels of activities, and give them the opportunity to develop an affinity for physical education. By providing our students with this equipment I hope to develop my students ability to work together. I believe that having them participate in team sports will develop their social emotional well being by teaching them how to problem solve, how to be more empathetic with each other, and how to relate to one another with respect.

This strategy will allow students to choose their own work space within the classroom. Choosing their own work space allows students to work in an area that they feel they will succeed in. Our school is in an extremely low income district; 60% of our students are receiving free and reduced lunches. Our building is also a Title One school which allows every student with a special need to be serviced. The students within our building are looking for stability and structure in their lives. As teachers, we are always trying to find new and innovative ways to catch and keep the attention of these high need children. We have limited resources and funds to try these wonderful ideas and most of the time, the money for these projects comes from our own paychecks. My students will be able to choose which seat they prefer best in my classroom. The flexible seating arrangement will allow students to sit, stand, kneel, or bounce on an exercise ball in order to maximize their learning. The research behind flexible seating shows that when students have the choice to sit where they would like to learn, then those students achieve higher because they are comfortable in their learning environments. Our materials include a shortened table for students to kneel/sit and work and beanbag chairs for students to work comfortably on. These materials will be extremely needed in order to implement flexible seating in the best way possible.

These books that I have chosen are just for that purpose. They are books I can use to introduce our skills and teach from. This project will allow me to step away from the basal and really teach! My resources are limited and it is hard to track down these books from various libraries. Also, when I get them from the library, that means they have to go back in 2 weeks. The kids are not able to enjoy them for long. They love being able to reread books that Ms. H read to them and with library books they can't! After using these books for read aloud, I would like to put them in our little class library for the students to enjoy over and over again during centers or free reading time. In order for my students to learn to read and learn to LOVE reading, they need good books! I will be able to model comprehension and other skills with these books and then the students will be able to enjoy them on their own. These books will help me get my students get excited about reading as they join me on amazing adventures in literature.

We do that in countless ways, resulting in a happy safe school for students. Our school is located just inside the city limits. We are a Title 1 school, where 89% of our students receive free or reduced lunch. Our students work hard everyday to be their best, do their best, and try their best. Our students strive to be respectful, responsible, and productive all throughout their school day --which usually runs from 7 am to 6 pm, if the students attend our free after school program. The faculty and staff at our school take pride in the hard work we put into our students and the hard work our students put in at school everyday. It is a partnership for the greater good and we expect our students to do great things! Our school needs a new set of walkie talkies to help ensure our students' safety. Walkies are used all day long as to not interrupt school-wide instruction with the intercom. These walkie talkies are used during morning drop off, to communicate with our school resource officer, for communication between the office and teachers while they are outside on the playground for recess, during dismissal in the afternoon, and the same walkie talkies are also used for communication during our after school program. This grant would enable each grade level K4-5th grade to have a properly working new walkie talkie to ensure the safety of our students. Walkie talkies are vital for our students safety and for proper communication throughout our school. Having walkie talkies will improve our school's effectiveness and safety by improving our ability to communicate with office staff during the school day. Walkie talkies limit interruptions to learning because they cut down on announcements made on the PA systems and allow teachers to communicate without having to walk to a phone. Having walkie talkies will help with communication both during the regular school day and during our after-school program, helping to keep our students safe.

With the energy that the students have I strive to keep them moving as much as possible. I teach students in grades 5-8 who come from a variety of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Team sports is a new concept to many of the students since they have not played them outside of school before. Most of the elementary schools that the students come from do not have a gymnasium, so there are a lot of skills and activities that the students have never heard of or had the opportunity to play prior to middle school. When students first come into the gym for PE they are amazed that this is where their classes will now be, and they cannot wait to get started! The equipment that I requested will be able to help me increase the number of items I have or replace broke/overused items. Being able to provide my students will more practice and the correct equipment I will be able to strengthen their skill set and knowledge and increase their confidence in settings where they are physically active. This equipment would help the students learn new team sports, have a chance to practice more, and increase their cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, and coordination. Having pinnies and cones will allow me to create more teams and fields for team sports like soccer. My current jump ropes are short for the students, so the longer ropes will help more students use jump rope as a cardiovascular/muscular endurance activity. The flags and hula hoop hoops will help us play more/new games. Whiffle ball equipment will help students learn the rules of baseball and improve their hand-eye coordination.

I want all of my students to make progress in academic and social areas, and a challenge is keeping their attention throughout the day and teaching them personal space. 'Every child deserves a Champion,'~ R. Pierson My classroom is made up of very active and eager to learn 1st graders. 1st graders' attention spans are very short, so I need to always be on top of my game to keep them fully engaged and give them every tool they may need to keep their learning successful. Teaching children about personal space and how to keep their focus is something that we work on constantly throughout the school year. It takes practice and consistency. My school has a very high poverty rate, and most students are on the free and reduced-price lunch program. Most children come from single parent, foster or grandparent raised families. We are a very safe and caring school and want our students' learning environment to be one that is respectful and purposeful. Classroom rugs that show students how to maintain their personal space is very important in the lower elementary grades. We spend a lot of time on the floor doing activities and learning in front of our smart board. Students are taught the Magic 5 Listening Rules at the carpet which is, 'Hands in lap, sit crisscross, eyes on the speaker, ears listening and mouths quiet.' Having a defined space helps students maintain their focus and become aware of how much space they need and to be courteous to the space of others. I am hoping that by having a classroom rug we can spend less time on personal space issues and more time on learning and exploring new things. Students can take what they learned about personal space to other classrooms or places they may go, so that the procedures are consistent.

My students are 6-7 year olds just beginning their education journey. They come from a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Some of the students qualify for free and reduced price lunch. Having a safe and comfortable place to come and learn is of top priority for me. The Hokki Stools I have chosen will have many different uses in my classroom. The wiggle seats are something I have been wanted to try for a while. They help the students have a comfortable seat to rock or wiggle in while still staying engaged in the lesson.

I have tried to build in quiet spaces, relaxed spaces, group and individual spaces. Middle Schoolers need lots of choice and variety. I teach in an urban k-8 school. We are a gifted and talented magnet, recognizing that giftedness comes in many forms and looks different for each child. My students come from diverse backgrounds, both culturally and socioeconomically. We have many languages spoken in our school. As sixth graders, our students are figuring out who they are and how they fit into the world around them. We aim to provide lots of different opportunities for our students to explore these ideas through projects, experiences, and conversation. I am requesting funding for two stand up desks. While I have tried to create multiple learning environments in my classroom, I find there a small number of students in each class that need to move and walk more than others. I have tried stability (yoga) balls, but the bouncy quality is over stimulating for some. I have tried bike inner tubes around chair legs for those who need to bounce. I would like to have two work options that allow for students to stand up as they work. They can use the kick bar to swing their legs or wiggle or sway their bodies as they work. I think that there are at least two student in each of my six classes that would benefit from this seating option. The rest of the class would benefit from the reduced distraction these student s currently provide. Here is a link to an article that supports my theories. http://www.nea.org/tools/47003.htm This donation would be more than a one time effect.

My students are five and six years old, attending an old building where furniture we have in our classrooms, our tables and chairs. We do however have one to one devices which supports my blended learning approach to learning. We do need more opportunities for student choice and where they can sit to learn the best that they can.

By the end of the year we want to be rich in science knowledge. We are a classroom of 20 English language learners. We are a very close knit school with students that are not afforded many opportunities that other students our age across the district may receive. We try our best despite our economical challenges and we definitely make the best out of what we have. We work very hard as a team to further our knowledge of real world topics so that we can be contributing members of our community one day. We are happy, energetic kids that just want the chance to explore and learn new things. My students come from very low economic situations and do not have the experiences or materials other students may receive. It is so rewarding to see them feel so proud about getting their own magazine that they can take home and share with their families. I have done this magazine in my classroom for 2 years now and it has been a great tool. We do a science lesson each Friday with the magazine. This magazine helps in so many different areas. We can focus on our reading skills while learning new science topics. We use the online resources for skills such as sorting, sequencing and language arts. I create a mini lesson to send home with the students for the parents to work with them and extend the learning outside of the classroom. This helps parents become involved in a rigorous and relevant learning experience with their child. Most of the topics are common core related and fit perfectly within our units as an extension of the required teaching. The magazine is a fresh, exciting way to present a topic to my students. Because my students are in a very low economic situation at home they do not own many if any books. Although not much to some, getting to take home this magazine is so exciting for them. After doing this project for 2 years, I can see this resource benefits my students in a huge way. As science has become a subject that is not at the forefront in the classroom this tool is a great way for me to introduce exciting, engaging science material for my students on a level that is very age appropriate.

As a result, their world view is limited by the blinders of a few city blocks. Literature, especially multicultural literature, provides students a window into the lives of others. The purpose of this project is to familiarize my students with Muslim life. While Muslim students represent a small minority in our school, each year their numbers continue to grow. Sadly, many of our Muslim students are bullied. I hope to use the book Ms. Marvel to teach our non-Muslim students that Muslim students are no different than any other student. Since the story’s protagonist is Muslim, I’m hopeful that Muslim students will feel a sense of pride as they see an aspect of themselves represented in the curriculum. Conversely, I’m hopeful that the non-Muslim students will learn respect and tolerance for their Muslim peers. Once individuals learn to look beyond outward differences, they start to see that the similarities we share as human beings are far more important. By learning about others, we often learn about ourselves. If students can recognize that people are people, they will not only respect people that are different but respect themselves, too.

Each group has its own supplies for various activities, lessons, or projects. They have scissors, glue, tape, crayons, markers, calculators, and their interactive science notebooks to keep organized. One of my students suggested to me to get something that can hold those supplies and keep them organized and easily accessible. My students are learning real-life problem-solving skills. They realized that our current system of staying organized with our supplies was not working. They brainstormed and came up with a great solution for the problem. They are learning to become responsible for their materials and learning to maximize their time. We need to organize our supplies. It takes away from our class time to get, use, and clean up our supplies. Many of our supplies get lost or broken when they are left at our group tables. It would be nice to have baskets at our group table to help oragnize all of our supplies so they are easy for us to access and use.

dd306150fa85a994774f4df3ba647e2c,Pedaling for Success,"Research shows that our district scores 3 out of 10 possible points in relation to performance on test scores, parent involvement, income levels, family units, structures, and Title 1 funds. As a teacher in a high poverty school district, my students are faced with several challenges both in and out of the classroom. One of the ways that teachers are addressing these deficits is by taking a thoughtful look at how we are teaching our students. How can we change our strategies and best practices to more efficiently address the special needs of our population? The idea to have pedal bikes in the classroom that allow for the sensory input the students need is such an exciting part of our multi-tiered solution to our unique needs. As with all school districts, budgets are tight, and the tools we need to foster movement and build a kinesthetic environment are lacking. Help our students get the tools they need to help them become more successful in the classroom. Every person learns in their own unique way. Every student benefits from learning in a multi-sensory way; therefore, we, as teachers, need to present our lessons in a multi-sensory way. Multi-sensory learning involves teaching your child through each of the senses at the same time. This includes auditory, visual, and kinesthetic learning. Many teachers easily incorporate auditory and visual learning; however, including kinesthetic learning is more difficult. These pedal bikes will incorporate this important movement into learning. Many studies show that children who are physically active learn more; however, there are an increasing number of academic demands that limit the amount of time children can be physically active. These pedal bikes allow students to move without taking time out of their academics. Pedal bikes are going to help us pedal into success. Exercise helps stimulate the brain and the pedals keep kids moving without distractions. There has been a great deal of research on kinesthetic classrooms. Our vision is to bring these pedal bikes into our school to begin developing a kinesthetic classroom of our own. The National Education Association (NEA) published a great article and video on a kinesthetic classroom that can be found here: http://neahealthyfutures.org/the-kinesthetic-classroom-teaching-and-learning-through-movement/ Including pedal bikes into our classroom is one small step to making a kinesthetic classroom and incorporating movement into everyday learning for our students!

They need to be able to move their bodies so they can learn. My classroom is one of four Pre-Kindergarten classrooms in our school. Our school has students ranging from pre-K to fourth grade. My classroom consists of 15 amazing children. They range in age from three to five. Seven of my students have Individualized Education Plans. The students with disabilities in my classroom vary. I have students who are unable to walk independently, students who are non-verbal, and students who have sensory needs that impact their education and social skills on a daily basis. My students come from a variety of cultures, socioeconomic sectors and family structures. Although they are all unique, they all have a common goal to be lifelong learners. They are curious and energetic. They play and move to learn. Even at a young age, they learn to work together to explore their environment and solve problems. My students have so much to offer, they teach me everyday! My students are very curious, active learners. They learn best from experiencing hands on learning opportunities. My students will be able to use the science materials to more actively explore their environment and thus learn more effectively. My students' curiosity will be fostered and their learning enhanced through being able to access these materials. My students will be able to participate in activities such as collecting natural materials outside, explore color mixing, experiment with magnets, look at different objects with a magnifying glasses to see a different perspective. In addition to the science materials, my students will also benefit greatly from the sensory materials. These materials, flashlights, tweezers and magnifying glasses, will directly impact their ability to focus and learn. My students will be able to adjust lighting to meet their needs. Students will be able to sit in chairs that are not stationary which will allow their bodies to move when they need to most. There is always room for change and improvement in our learning environments. Our students are constantly changing and growing. From day to day the needs of our students change and as an educator it is my job to foster a learning environment and classroom community that is able to best meet the needs of my students. If my students are able to be challenged yet have their basic needs met, they are more likely to become successful lifelong learners. This project will allow my students to grow.

When asked if they enjoy eating healthy students responded by saying they did not enjoy eating whole fruits and vegetables. Hearing these responses I did more research into other ways of enjoying nutrition. I found students would enjoy the amazing benefits of juicing their fruits and vegetables for the mind and body. After students got to experience the taste and process of juicing vegetables and fruits. They responded with high interest to continue juicing and want to make it a regular part of our classroom curriculum.

They require teachers, related service providers (speech, occupational, and physical therapists) who are specialized and have experience working with students with special needs. They also require adapted equipment such as modified chairs or desks that have more support, use of objects and pictures to convey information, equipment for the related service providers, and communication devices that help my students speak and express themselves. My students have special needs such as autism, intellectual disabilities, motor-speech disorders, genetic syndromes, etc. They have a lot of difficulty with language and communication. This means that many of the students cannot speak or speak in one-two sentences. These students use an alternative form of communication such as an augmentative device or laminated picture cards. Most have language delays that affect their ability to understand, express themselves, and interact with peers. This may also lead to issues with frustration or expressing themselves through behaviors. The 2 iPads I am requesting will help my students communicate. Most of them have difficulty with expressing themselves. Some have motor-speech disorders that make it extremely difficult to speak, in addition to other disabilities such as autism spectrum disorders or an intellectual impairment.

Last year we had 36 students involved in our choir and most of them are coming back next year. They have so much potential and I really want them to see their dreams become reality.  Our high school has just one choir for students to be involved in. That means we have to make our one choir count! We would love to go to choral festival this year, but we need to get new dresses to look professional. Our current dresses don't match and have seams ripping out of them. The girls in our choir would really like to have dresses that all look the same and help us represent our school with pride.

Over the years we have seen an increase in diagnoses of ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorders, and various emotional behavior needs. Due to the changes in our population and diverse needs of our students, we have decided to combine all 5th grade classes into a flexible learning environment. We are hoping for a complete classroom makeover and are leaving the traditional classroom behind for a flexible learning environment. Flexible seating is phase 1 or our project. Flexible seating spaces allow students to work collaboratively and engage in critical thinking. The wobble chairs, bean bag and stability ball will allow students to make choices in their environment to help them discover how they learn best through flexible seating options. As recess decreases in our schools, we see the increased need for students to MOVE. These materials will benefit the classroom by making it a more welcoming and student-centered environment catered to all individual learning needs.",My students need opportunities to interact with each other in flexible seating to learn in ways that best meet their individualized needs.

My classroom is rich with diversity and we celebrate each student's identity and culture. My students are always moving! I use alternative seating, center based learning, and differentiation to target the needs of all of my students. In my school, the classrooms are co-taught and have a cluster of students who are just learning English or have special needs. I currently have a Language Academy room. Next year, 2016-2017, I will have the special educatioon room and I couldn't be more excited!

The easel my class has right now, is extremely old, does not erase, and does not hold supplies that we need to easily access in order to learn. The easel we currently have is small and the students at the back of the carpet cannot always see the board which hinders their learning.

They are dedicated to taking care of themselves, their friends and their families. They bring it every day and that motivates me to bring it every day - and to fight to give them the school they deserve. If you give a man information, you teach him for a day. If you give a man the internet... you will allow him to teach himself forever. And that is really the ultimate goal of education! Our classroom would be transformed with the ability to go online and use Google's suite of applications any time, any day. The internet is humanity's greatest access point to our collective knowledge - and in many ways to one another. And besides the general richness of ideas, knowledge and opportunities that providing this to my students will allow, the internet also provides endless new science simulations, activities, and tools to enhance our lessons and engage in authentic learning experiences. As a teacher, this will streamline our class operations (I envision using Google classroom, providing an updated calendar with each day's lessons and deadlines, not PRINTING EVERYTHING OUT) and astronomically multiply our learning opportunities. For my students, digital literacy is HUGELY important to developing into our future citizens and workforce- they need more experience typing, writing emails, and learning to effectively search and vet sources online, to name a few skills. They also crave anything connected to the internet and computer time (we do not have a library or dedicated devices for all our students to use; the lab is usually taken for online classes).

Since every child is different, I believe in having different choices and opportunities for them. They love having a voice and choice in their seating arrangement and activities during the day. My dream is to set up my classroom like a coffee shop. When you go into a coffee shop to do some work, you have choice. I don't have someone telling me my spot for the remainder of my time there. I have the choice to pick my seat. I also have the choice to change my mind and sit somewhere else during my time at the coffee shop. My students love the opportunity to have a voice in the classroom. Having different seating options will really help them in determining where they want to complete their work. Setting my classroom up as a coffee shop will really emphasize the type of learning environment my students want and need. I want to lower one desk and have the deluxe sit-upons as an option for students who want to work at a desk but in a different way.

We have often been called 'The Country Campus for the College Bound.' That is a fitting description of our physical setting--and we do expect every student to go to college. All students are transported from their neighborhoods to our front door. Our student body is serious and goal-directed, maintaining an average daily attendance of over 90%.

These students are faced with many challenges at home and at school so this project will give my students a sense of accomplishment and will give them life skills in reading, writing, science, and caring for the environment. The soft skills such as team work, meeting deadlines, reviewing and editing work, perseverance and grit are all great skills for future college and career goals. In Idaho we enjoy the great outdoors and my science students are going to have great authentic learning experiences because of a partnership with the Fish and Wildlife agency to include adopting a pond/park area next to our school to care for and research the wildlife and natural environment. Our students will work to conserve the natural habitat. The students will be able to contribute to the pond/park by planting willows with the agency, testing environmental factors to keep the pond healthy and monitor the fish population. With all these great experiences our students need to be able to share their learning with others through a printed magazine for younger students and an online format for older students. Both versions will be written by students and shared with the other 13 schools in our district.

Watching them grow as readers and mathematicians throughout the year is one of my favorite things about being a teacher. Some come at the beginning of the year knowing very little and by the end of the year they are reading grade level text and using strategies to solve difficult math problems. Any donations made greatly benefit the students at my school!In First Grade students are learning how to read! It is important that they hear themselves read to improve pronunciation and fluency. Whisper phones are a great tool for students because it allows them to hear themselves read without distracting the entire class. Getting students engaged and excited to read is also important. These bright orange phones are exactly what first graders need! Tattling, regulating emotions, and sharing are all examples of what first graders struggle with. Using books is a great way to teach students how to manage their social emotional needs inside and outside of the classroom setting!

In my third grade special education classroom, we have students who have learning disabilities, Autism, cognitive impairments, cerebral palsy and attention difficulties. My school is also a Title 1 school, most of our families are very low income or at poverty level. The majority of families at my school speak another language at home providing language barriers as well. In order to be effective, I must provide students multiple opportunities to reach their learning goals, as the expectations for my students are set high to ensure they are successful learners. With all these challenges my students face, they come in each day excited and ready to learn. We are a family that provides each other with the support and encouragement needed to conquer each and every challenge that we are faced with. Together, we learn compassion and problem solving strategies that makes us stronger as a team and individually. In a special education classroom it is important to have a safe and welcoming atmosphere. The large carpet will be a place for students to dive into their books and a place to share what we have learned throughout the day, monitor our progress and set future learning goals. Throughout the day students will be exposed to a hands-on curriculum. They need to be able to use clipboards when they are scientists solving problems and conducting investigations. As math wizards, they need buzzers when their team figures out problems during challenges. Chart paper will be used to monitor our learning and thinking in an organized way that the entire class can participate in. Having books on display is a great way to keep students reading. The new book shelf will be an inviting way to display books that incorporate math and science which will encourage reading in all subject areas.

Our room has a large collection of books, but we need a way to display the books to give our students easy access to view and check out books to take home. Currently, the books are stored in cardboard boxes, and this makes it difficult for the students to locate and find books that they are interested in reading. We would love to have bookshelves and bins to display our classroom library! The bookshelves and bins would organize the books that we already have into groups to ease and assist the pre-kindergarten students in locating a certain type of book.

Our first grade class is comprised of 25 amazing students, many of whom are full of energy and ready to learn! I truly believe a flexible classroom would help them become more engaged and active learners in the classroom. Our current goal is for every student to have his/her own wobble chair in the classroom. This is a great first step in reaching our overall goal of a flexible classroom. There is ample amounts of research that supports the idea that flexible seating options in the classroom are beneficial to all students especially young learners. Students become more engaged in their learning activities, leading to better grades and test scores when movement is allowed while seated. The Wobble Chair is a simple seat design to allow movement when children are required to sit. 'The Kore Chair is not just a piece of furniture...it's a LIFE-Changer for active kids, kids with ADHD and Autistic kids...Aggressive wobbling on a KORE Chair increases blood to the brain and thereby quiets the requirement for fidgety kids to move...Kids learn better and are more productive...the Kid who may be considered 'Unteachable' is now able to learn!'

The enthusiasm and motivation of our students is unparalleled, but without the necessary supplies we cannot provide them the education they deserve. Your donation will help these students have a fun, engaging year of science. One of the best ways researchers have found to teach students science is through the use of interactive science notebooks (ISNs). ISNs are notebooks given to each individual student to use throughout the year. During each unit in the class, students receive notes, activities, and review materials via sheets of paper that can be cut and pasted into their ISN. These materials are often more interactive than your standard worksheets, and ISNs allow students to engage with and take ownership of their learning. In addition to the notebooks themselves, the scissors and glue sticks will allow students to cut and paste items into their ISNs, and the labels will allow us to properly organize the notebooks, seeing as they will all look similar and will be used for multiple grades and sections. The name tag labels will be placed on the front of the notebooks and have the students name, grade, and period, and the neon colored labels will go on the spine of the notebook and have the grade and period so that the notebooks can be kept in the classroom and stay organized.","My students need scissors, notebooks, glue sticks, and labels for their interactive science notebooks for the year.

They're trying to figure out who they are as individuals while wanting to slip into the invisibility of belonging to a group. My students are regular kids with a hunch that life might matter, they might matter, and things will be expected of them in this world. My students are perhaps different than other kids their age by just how much has been expected of them so far. In fact a recent study claimed that many urban learners experience trauma that is equal or greater to that suffered by soldiers returning from war. For many of my students middle school is one of the last chances to utilize their resilience and experience to create a way forward that will truly live up to their promise. I recently went to a wood carving class with my 10 year-old son in Northern Minnesota. The instructor was lamenting how knives are seen as weapons in our modern culture and wished that they could be viewed as they are by craftspeople: tools that help people, not harm them. When I saw how careful and serious my son was with the tool and the look of pure concentration on his face as he shaped his piece of wood, I knew it was something that I wanted my Montessori students to experience. Montessori said, 'The hand is the tool of the mind,' and in the digital age a need for authentic hands-on learning has never been greater. With the carving materials I will guide students through a series of projects related to the local cultures we are studying. The craft of wood carving is an important tradition for the native people of our state as well as the large Scandinavian immigrant population. As a test run for this project I had a couple of my 8th graders who were desperate for a hands-on project use a couple of woodcarving tools I had bought myself. They carved two words onto their own blocks of basswood; one word that would guide them through the next year, and another that wood guide them through the next 10 years. One student chose the words 'work' and 'duty.' They are two short words but the process of working over the course of two weeks to carve them in wood I think also gave them the time to let the words truly sink in.

I asked a student to pick it up. He picked it up and he saw another bottle, which he also picked up. He then told the student that was walking with him that he can throw the bottles in the recycling bin. I am very proud of the students at my school. Amino acids are essential for every metabolic process. It is imperative that students learn about amino acids and how they effect they body.

Everyday my students come in from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, excited to learn new things. For many of my students, coming to school is one of the only opportunities they get to read books and that in itself, exposes them to a new world of imagination and high level thinking. Furthermore, roughly 2/3 of my students come in with limited English ability as well as hindrances to vocabulary, both of which have a major impact on the ability to read. 53% of our students population are English Language Learners and 86% of students are a part of the free and reduced lunch program for low income. These types of factors are just a few of the influences that prevent the possibilities for my students to get their hands on rich literature outside of school. My goal is to bring it to them on a daily basis through a variety of media.I am requesting these materials in order to offer my students the opportunity to use different forms of activities for literacy centers and push them to work more independently or use peer support in their learning. I have a high percentage of students who come into my classroom behind grade level in reading as well as other skills. Students will be using a variety of literacy media to aide them in building independence that will help them make more progress in their reading and writing skills. These types of products provide students with step by step procedures that are accompanied with both visuals and text to support all learners. Students will be able to use these materials to build on what has already been taught through reading, writing or phonics lessons. Their background knowledge and acquired skills through other literacy subject matter will enable them to keep making progress as they review and practice. My students need to have many ways at their exposure, to review and practice their literacy skills that will support level of understanding but also challenge them. Many of my students are English Language Learners and need activities that are visual specific and provide explicit directions that will increase their independence during work time. They will be able to take what they have learned during large or small group lessons and apply it immediately as they use these type of center activities. These literacy type centers will also hold my students accountable to completely them correctly because of the way the activities are laid out.","My students need engaging instant learning centers, such as 'Teaching Reading Skills Activity Centers', 'Road to Reading Activity Center' and 'Stack and Build Phonics Flip Books' because they will help increase reading skills.",Literacy & Language,Grades PreK-2,Supplies,774.27,Fully Funded

Many of the students live in poverty. In my experience, most students do not have the resources at home that are often needed in the classroom. Our students love to learn, read, and write. They seek out new ways to lead their own learning. I want to be able to provide materials for them to do so. My students participate in an ELA module designed around learning about maps as well as the geography of the world. They learn about different cultures and different landforms around the world that make obtaining books a major challenge. During their research, students read about different countries around the World and how the students from those countries obtain books as well as their schooling experience. Students become highly engaged learning about literacy around the World. At the end of the module, students choose a country that they have studied about and create an illustrated bookmark with informational texts about that country. Bookmarks are then reproduced and sold to family members, schoolmates, and the community. Profits from the sale of bookmarks will be donated to our local Children's Hospital to purchase books for the hospital's waiting room. These books will help me in various ways.

All of our students are newly arrived to the United States. Their families have come to USA to start a new life, away from deadly conflict, famine, or political exile. My Asian (Burmese and Nepali) students have names like: Mang, Pa, Soe, Tha, Guna, and Rai. My students from western parts of Africa have names like: Leonce, Mohamed, Jumbe, and Fazi. My Latino students' names include Roman, Jose, and Louise. Before our students are transferred to a traditional school/classroom they attend intensive English classes. My goal is to build up our students' background knowledge in science. This fall term, our 8th grade lessons for physical science begin with units of measurements and the elements on the periodic table. However I am excited to share with you our code project (Forces: motion, acceleration, balance...). Hands on in class group projects require our English Learner students to participate and engage in learning as a group using one common language, English language skills. Large mapping printed projects are used with simple control code programmed robots (Ozobot and Sphero). These group projects prepare students for more advanced digital technology skills and real world technology language skills used in real occupation tasks and challenges, such as air and ground transportation controls and instructional media. These middle school technology skills/ goals are largely missing in our student population, largely due to language barriers. Thank you all, so very much!Ground space orientation is more than understanding which way is left and right. According to Ms. Mozer, the learning goals are: student can identify and demonstrate uses of grid locations and provide travel instructions using North, South, East, and West vectors. In addition to mapping ground instructions, student can implement basic motion program code to manipulate remote robotic tasks. Ms. Mozer calls it peer learning when some students are able to teach what they understand to some other students. Ms Mozer also says that their is only one of her, so we must all help each other to learn what we need to know each day. She also says that real leaders serve the group. Students from other parts of the world have so much to learn about so many things in the United States. The English language, the technology, the culture are all very different for newly arrived citizens. Science lessons provided learning experiences in language, culture, and technology in one class.

I am a firm believer in keeping the focus on what's really important: the students! As a teacher, I focus on student motivation and higher engagement within all my lessons. When we look outside our classrooms, our fast-paced, ever-changing world is full of independent choices. We are teaching students to make the best choice and be problem-solvers. For many students, sitting still in a chair for long periods of the day can be very difficult. Last year I did many 'brain breaks,' which consisted of three to five minute mini exercise routines that were geared towards 4th grade students' interest. They LOVED it! Now I want to take it one step further with flexible seating. With flexible seating, students will be able to choose which seat will give them maximum engagement while using up energy and creating a better flow of oxygen to the brain. Students will be able to choose which learning space is best for their learning. I would like five round pillow for students who would like to work on the floor, two wobble chairs for students who require more movement, and two bean bags for students who like more of a lower angle of seating.

Benefits of practicing meditation and yoga for those coming into adolescence (10–12 years) include creating a safe place to thrive, while their bodies experience amazing changes and their connections to peers strengthen.

Many of my students will need assistance building social skills so that they can be a contributing member of our classroom community. Having a classroom community helps the children to feel safe and respected in the classroom. In order to learn effectively, my students must feel safe! This project is one that I've been thinking about for awhile now. After two years of the traditional seating model, name tags and rigid assigned seats, I've realized that the flexible seating model can be a powerful one! Think about companies who are providing their employees with options; treadmill desks, standing desks, medicine ball chairs, all implemented to improve the productivity of work. Why shouldn't students have similar options in the classroom? Not everyone is their most productive self when sitting at a desk all day; it's essential to have choice. Giving students the opportunity to take learning into their own hands will help to empower them and teach them to be responsible for their own learning. In order to do this, our room is going to need some reconstruction.

Despite the hardships of fleeting businesses, the contamination of water, and other social issues beyond my student's control, they still strive to have a successful life after leaving high school. I work to give them the best education possible by the use of different pedagogy and practices to reach all students and instill a drive to succeed. Flexible seating is an essential change that will meet the needs of my students. Data proves that flexible seating brings upon more stimulating conversation, an increase in grades, and a feeling of comfort against the 'cemetery feel' of most classrooms. Yoga mats, disks, and high back stools will allow students to participate in collaborative learning. Bean bags and LapDesks will give individuals a space to read, write, and learn. The concept of using exercise balls and Big Joe chairs will bring about the feel of a safe and comfortable place where students can feel free to learn his/her own way.","My students need a classroom with comfortable seating that goes against the cold, traditional classroom.

The majority of my students come from low income households, and our school is where they love to come to read, play and learn. My students love exploring and learning with hands on materials! They are creative and full of energy, few things get them more excited than new books or new sets of supplies. Many of my students come to first grade behind in reading and math. Because of this, we have to work extra hard to get them caught up and ready for 2nd grade, in just the 182 days we have together. Every day we spend time doing phonics, guided reading, literacy centers, math meeting, interventions and enrichment hour. Our school days are jam packed with activities, learning new things and trying our best!My Students live in a rural town in Mississippi. I am very excited about the subscription to Scholastic News because of the content and grade level reading practice. My students need to be exposed to ideas and stories from around the world in a way that is exciting to read. I know my students will love these weekly readers!My students also love our daily centers routine. During this time, students work in small groups with hands on materials. The fishing games, sight word string activities and model clay are all materials that they will LOVE to learn with. Having these resources really helps new skills stick in their brains, because they are getting the opportunity to learn by doing. Lastly, our room has very little storage to keep our materials in good condition. The chair back organizers will give my students the opportunity to take ownership of their things and practice at keeping their materials neat and orderly. These skills are very important to success in upper grades and real life. Thank you for considering donating to my project. I have put a lot of thought into every item I have selected and how it will benefit my students, I know these materials will make a tremendous impact on our year!

What I ask for is to level the playing field just a bit and grant us these ELA books. The books I am requesting are extremely useful in implementing the Common Core English language Arts (ELA). They contain every Common Core strand yet presented in a less intimidating way, with plenty of practice pages for young students to work on. These books will help prepare my students for the high stakes testing held in the spring. They are an essential tool that will help level the huge educational gap that currently exist between the 'haves and have not'.

I'm making every attempt to get them the supplies that they need to make great learning gains, be connected to the content, and stay highly engaged! With your help, together we can create an optimal learning environment and provide these wonderful students with what they need to succeed!Yoga has the ability to help students connect with their bodies and regain control over their emotions when they are struggling to navigate the effects of stress and anxiety. I recently completed a yoga training specifically focused on bringing yoga into the elementary classroom. I hope to bring awareness of the power of connecting with the breath and body and what that can do for the growing mind of a young child. Yoga mats will allow my first graders to safely participate in our brain break activities, yoga or otherwise, and prepare them to be able to access the education they deserve. The world we live in today requires students to come to school ready to learn. When many students are exposed to trauma and crisis in their homes, it is challenging for them to come with a clear head. Students cannot learn if they are unable to attend to and connect with their education with a mind free from stress.

I have a class of 25-3rd graders. They are precious students who are eager to learn. Many times they get restless and have built up energy that lasts all day long. I keep them moving as much as I can, but at times they have to sit and learn. These students living situations aren't always ideal for them to get out their energy and move around unfortunately. Many are stuck living in small apartments with a large family and no yard to run around in. Several of my students have ADHD as well. It really is a struggle and constant battle for these students to be in a classroom without moving much throughout the day. Many students constantly struggle with having to sit still all day long in the classroom. Often times they end up getting in trouble because of it. However, these stools give them the ability to rock and constantly move. I have personally sat on these stools and loved them. It is nice having the ability to move around even if it is just a little bit. I would eventually love to have an entire class set of these stools. These stools will be used on a daily basis by all students as they rotate through small groups in math and reading. I can also use them throughout the regular instruction day when I have those students who just need that extra movement. These Wobble stools will increase the blood flow to the brain which will help stimulate the students mind and help them focus on their studies since they are able to get their wiggles out throughout the day.

They truly look forward to learning and being in the classroom with their friends every day. Unfortunately, our classroom is lacking some of the basics needed for learning. Please consider helping our first and second grade classroom get set up for success this school year. First and second grade students need help with organization and self-regulation. They also need personal and community space! Chair pockets and a classroom community rug will help our scholars with such skills. Seat pockets are a great way to keep clutter at a minimum. They reduce the need for classroom mailboxes and cubbies - which tend to take up too much space. Seat pockets are also washable and reusable - making them an investment that will produce results for years to come. Seat pockets keep students organized and give each student a place for their own supplies and books. A classroom rug helps to build a classroom community while at the same time providing a special space for each child. This personal space within the classroom community helps each child to feel safe and secure. When a child feels safe and secure, learning increases exponentially.

26de2217acc0967e5fb5f7690cffb827,Stay Focused with Art,"I am surrounded by resilience and creativity everyday. My students inspire me. I am the only counselor in a K-5 school so I keep VERY busy. My students are very motivated but many struggle with getting basic needs met at home. 100 percent of them get free lunch and most of my parents work nights or two jobs to make ends meet. In addition many do not speak English or very limited English and many are refugees. I deal daily with the kind of problems that stem from not getting basic needs met. In the midst of all this I help children express themselves in ways that help them to build a core sense of self. I learned a long time ago that a young child is likely to be more comfortable initially expressing himself with art than he is going to be at expressing emotions and feelings through words. I stay in at recess and after school trying to keep up with all the needs of my students and after 11 years I still truly love it. The students at my school come into my office to cool down and relieve anxiety in order to get ready to go back to class and be ready to learn. I need the tools to help them get what they need. The repetitive activities such as sewing and building helps many children relax and focus so they are able problem solve and self sooth. I think for a lot of my students self care such as this must be taught, they don't at first know what it is that helps them to calm down. Art therapy such as sewing and sculpting gives children the opportunity to do both in a safe environment. Some common art therapy goals for young children are sensory awareness and integration, problem-solving skills, identification and expression of feelings, and increased self-esteem. My students crave the soothing effects of art. Being able to provide them with the materials they need to be successful in this medium will increase their ability to develop a new skill that will help increase their self-esteem. My students need embroidery hoops, thread, needles and muslin for sewing and clay, paint, and brushes for building their sculpture masterpieces.

Our district is in Flint Township with many of our students negatively impacted by the Flint Water Crisis. Over 40% of our students live with only one parent or guardian. On average, our families are trying to survive on a family income of less than $40,000 per year. To say that our community is struggling is an understatement. Struggles are required in order to succeed in life; because in order to stand up, you need to know what it is like to fall down. We are in the struggle together. Because of the lack of health care in our community, many of our students are facing health issues. The lead exposure alone is causing developmental delays, attention deficit disorders, and behavioral concerns. We are doing all we can to help all children feel safe, comfortable, and at home in our school. It is becoming more difficult for our children to thrive in this community. They rely on the school to provide for their needs. We give them clean water, food, and a safe place to rest. It is my job to make them comfortable and free in their environment. I want to give them choice and an opportunity to develop an awareness about themselves by giving them alternate seating.

Opening the doors through reading is my goal for my students. Students at my school are so eager to learn and absorb knowledge on a daily basis. With the start of a new group of students, my goal is to see plenty of growth in my students and teach them to love learning. My school is located in a small rural farming area where many of the parents are in the fields picking food all day. We are a Title I and Renaissance school meaning over 90% of our children get free lunches. Most of them have so many needs. Many of my students lack English fluency and confidence in mastering the English language because they come from Spanish-speaking homes. We also don't have a PTA, meaning many of the items that are in the classroom come from our own pockets. The parents at this school have a difficult time affording many necessities, let alone books and reading resources. I would like to help my students learn. I am asking for four exercise balls and bouncy bands for my students. The resources asked for in this grant will be used by my students each day. The exercise balls will be used for students of special needs, helping them to stay focused and release their energy by bouncing. The bouncing bands will be placed on students' chairs, allowing them to tap their feet in class. This is a great resource, because it can be done without disturbing others. These would be used for students that get nervous while working and those that need to center their energy. Both of these resources will greatly improve the attention of individual students. This project will give students the opportunity to be successful in learning, by helping them to focus their energy. Not every student is the same, so finding resources like these to implement into the classroom are key to helping them in learning. Our class will be equipped with the tools necessary to listen in class, as well as work independently. It is so important for children to fall in love with learning and I believe these resources will help them in that process.

We discovered this past year that our class consisted of students with backgrounds from 6 different countries (Philippines, Madagascar, El Salvador, Mexico, Somalia & the U.S.). We celebrate the various cultures and learn a lot from each other. However, many of my students come from single parent families. Being raised in a single parent home, can put limitations on things we take for granted like financial resources and TIME. Some of my students have parents that don't speak English fluently, so they are limited with the academic support that they can give their child. In spite of these limitations my students come to school everyday ready to put forth their best effort to share what they know and to learn something new. Our school is considered a high poverty/ low income school. Many of my students are behind academically for a variety of reason, including home life, lack of learning tools, etc. Despite these limitations and challenges, my students come to school eager to share and ready to learn. They make me proud!I would love for my students to have a clean and comfortable place to gather together in the classroom. Last year, our custodian gave us a large carpet remnant from old carpeting in our building. While this carpet served its purpose, it wasn't very clean and caused some concerns after rashes appeared on the legs of a student and myself. The custodian replaced it with some carpet squares that she had. She has moved to another building now and taken the square with her. So this year I would love for my students to have a clean and comfortable gathering place in our classroom. We will use the classroom carpet to meet for morning meetings and morning work. It will also be the place for students to sit and listen to reading as well as the place to students to share their ideas and their writing. It'll be a place for math instruction and math games. It will be the central place in our classroom like the kitchen is in our homes.

This year I will be moving to a more non traditional approach called flexible seating. Students will be able to choose where they sit everyday in class. They will have the responsibility of choosing the type of seating where they learn best. I will also lower a few tables so that some students may work sitting on the floor with a wobble cushion and raise a table so that students may also stand to work. Flexible seating benefits include burning more calories, using up excess energy, improving metabolism, increased motivation and engagement, creating a better oxygen flow to the brain, and improving core strength and overall posture. Physical activity is linked to higher academic performance, better health, and improved behavior. It is also great for students with ADD and ADHD.

They wanted all students to have equal opportunities when it came to field trips (not- required trips that cost money), books in classrooms, and other class trips to be available to all. Last year they raised money and bought books for every classroom in the school. They were also able to give small scholarships to their classmates in need so they could all have equal opportunities. Their new big idea is to have a annual walk-a-thon to raise money for projects that students and teachers want to do that are the 'extras'. Along with the possibility of raising funds, the entire school will walk 3 miles with their buddies in October. (The 8th graders are buddies to the 3rd to be mentors and to create a healthy environment between the older and younger students in the building.) Not only will they walk together, but they will talk about the health benefits of walking and see our local neighborhood and the history in the area. They want to establish the walk-a-thon so they can leave a legacy of community building for all grades. Students will be organizing a whole school walk-a-thon to help build community in all grades. They will present the walk-a-thon to classrooms. They will collect pledges from classrooms. They will help classrooms graph and total the percentage of students who have participated as well as how much they have collected in pledges.

We think that to have peace you need to learn to get along with everyone and choose kind even when being kind is not easy. Our school has 9 grades in it. We want to help the younger kids be kind and successful in school. We hope by walking together as a school we can get to know them better so we can be better mentors to the younger students.

The students come from diverse backgrounds and speak a variety of languages. Every student is valued for their unique strengths, culture, and learning style. Kindergarteners are naturally inquisitive about their world. In our integrated curriculum, science, math, art, and literacy are combined during active learning opportunities to provide experiences that are real and relevant to the students. Our classroom is full of learning opportunities! Science, math, technology, art, and literacy skills can all be practiced and directly acquired through STEM activities. This project provides experiences where all of those subjects come together. With literature links of favorite fairy tales, students will actively learn science, technology, math, art, and literacy skills through carefully constructed activities. In addition, science tools will allow students to explore the world around them to gain a deeper understanding. These materials will greatly benefit the students in the classroom!

The students at my school have a love for learning and a great deal of creativity. They are very active, and they are always ready for an opportunity to show their 'colors'. As a teacher at an arts infused school, it allows me to engage and motivate students by emphasizing active learning rather than passive learning.

In this project I am requesting 6 additional stools to add to the 12 already provided by generous donors on this site and from the Pine Street Grant Foundation. The stools are great for students with attention deficit disorders as well as students who just like to wiggle.

My students work hard to grow their brains and to work on relationships. Often, our classroom resources are lacking in diversity when nurturing these relationships. They would love to see more diverse toys and books in their classroom. Students need to be able to see themselves in the things that they read. Books with diverse backgrounds are often not found in classrooms. The books requested will allow my children to picture themselves in the books they read and to recognize the diversity in our society. Children in Pre-K are learning to love books and stories. Having a better selection of diverse stories will motivate them to learn to love reading. You can help my students feel important! Dramatic play is an important part of a Pre-K classroom. The toys in this project will allow the children to create families that reflect their own while practicing social problem solving skills. The Pretend and Play families as well as the career vinyl people encourage children to practice different roles and to dream about different careers. Many of my students are learning English. When the Pretend and Play families are reflective of the diversity of the area students are excited to learn and practice language skills including new vocabulary. Vocabulary volume predicts the ability to read and succeed throughout their school years. My district has over 80% of children living in poverty. It is an extremely diverse community. We work hard to learn to work with all of our cultural differences and appreciate our differences.

These seats will be utilizes at my small group table during which time, learning letters, sounds, and how to read will be a daily stop for all the children in the class. That same small group table will then change to Math concepts and learning numbers, how to count to 100 and solving simple word problems.

The students in my classes want to learn and each student deserves access to what will help them be successful in their future. Currently, the access to technology at my school is a challenge. My school has about 1600 students and teachers are only allowed to reserve the computers for 4 days in each month based on a first-come-first-serve basis. The Chromebooks would give students access to technology in my classroom. It would also allow them to authentically engage in the learning and it creates equity because some students do not have access to technology at home, making it difficult for them to achieve at the same level as their peers. I want to set my students up for success in whatever path they choose for their future.

Let's give them materials to express their creativity! Donating to this project will help the students to be interested in learning! The materials I am requesting, allow the students to practice necessary skills in a fun way! All of the materials I am requesting about life cycles correspond to a specific area of study that the students will learn about. These materials will allow the students to dive deeper into dramatic play roles. For example, a student can become a doctor and use the MRI Scan to show the 'patient' specifically what is wrong with them. The other materials in the cart, will be used in 'have-tos' for the students to practice a specific skill that he/she needs more practice with. To learn more sight words the students will be able to play the sight word fishing game. To get better at phonemic awareness, which will help the student with his/her writing and reading, he/she can play the interactive Smartboard game. In addition, the number puzzle will allow the students to put numbers 0-30 in order. Being able to identify, write, and represent numbers 0-31 is a high priority learning target in Kindergarten. I am trying to make learning come alive in my classroom. I want student's to see school as a fun way to challenge their learning and enhance their skills.

My students are the type of kids which people may not expect much from. When I came to this school is had just received an F, which meant it was a failing school. In my classroom, at least half of my students were one to three grade levels behind. Coming from low socio-economic backgrounds they come to my classroom missing background knowledge and experiences. However, I teach my students to dream and aspire to be more than their current circumstances.I teach my students that no matter what kind of neighborhood you grow up in, they too can leave a great impact on the world. I grew up in the same neighborhood and came back after going to college to make a difference. Many of my students have difficulty focusing and sitting their seat. Brain research shoes that these types of students greatly benefit from alternate seating. This year in my classroom I plan on focusing on the idea of a'Growth Mindset'. Studies show that students who think they can learn something are far more likely to be successful that students who feel they can't. Many of my students suffer from low self esteem and are afraid to take risks. I am going to encourage a growth mindset in my students and the book that were chosen would help me motivate my students. I will spend more time this year talking about what my students CAN do rather than what they haven't learned how to do... YET! I will use these books as read aloud to frame my growth mindset lessons throughout the year. Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you are right. - Harry FordThe books will also be used to help increase literacy skills. I need new books for them to read in order to help them build vocabulary and begin reading on level or above.

Students here face challenges unlike the average child and any comfort not afforded at home, I hope they discover at our school. This project is designed to fill the need for black and white print in the classroom. Along with age appropriate novels like 'Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief' , 'Hatchet' , and others; our class will be diving into these worlds of fiction to analyze structures, characters, themes, and other English and Language Arts standards covered in sixth grade. Incredible journeys and eye-opening experiences are discovered through the process of reading great works of fiction.

Over half of our students are on free or reduced meals. My classroom is filled with energetic, eager to learn, full of life first graders. Their bodies are made to keep moving. The kids in my classroom as shown me over and over again how important it is for them to keep moving to help them digest what they are learning! When their moving bodies and minds work together you get success! Everything I do in my classroom is based on research and best practices for my kids. Redesigning my classroom is not any different. I've found through my research that some of the immediate benefits of flexible seating which includes using Hokki stools, balance balls, and core discs reaps the benefits of burning more calories, using up excess energy, improving metabolism, increase motivation and engagement, creating a better oxygen flow to the brain, and improving core strength and overall posture. It's no surprise that physical activity is linked to higher academic performance, better health, and improved behavior. My goal is to have a classroom environment that is conducive to open collaboration, communication, creativity and critical thinking by providing them with a variety of flexible seating options. By redesigning my classroom and implementing flexible seating, it will increase student motivation, enhance their level of engagement and provide them with the responsibly to choose the best learning space for themselves.

Our school has a 50% free and reduced lunch population, but our progress and goals attainment demonstrate that hard work and a school-wide positive learning environment can overcome obstacles such as poverty. 'Keep your love of nature, for that is the true way to understand art more and more.' Vincent van Gogh Our tight budget has little room for art projects that require specialized materials. The projects though are invaluable. My students rarely have the opportunity to work on art projects, but they are so engaging and important for their expression and educational experience at school. My students deserve these art opportunities because so many will not otherwise be exposed to them. My classroom has formed a partnership with Audubon Dakota and the US Fish and Wildlife Service in order to educate our students on the importance of our prairie lands. Together we work on nature-based learning projects that educate our students on prairie vegetation and wildlife, as well as prairie restoration. In particular, we have been focusing on the monarch butterfly habitats. While a lot of the projects and instruction occur in our school's nature area and the local state wildlife refuge, we also want to make connections back in the classroom. Art is the perfect way to connect the beauty of our prairie land with the expressive creations of my students. 'Great art picks up where nature ends.' Marc Chagall My students will use the art supplies, canvas boards and paint, in order to create nature-based artwork. They will paint butterflies, animals, wildflowers, or landscapes that reflect what they see in our special prairie lands. The artwork will be displayed and rotated in the school's hallways in order to educate the rest of the school (parents, staff, and students) of the beauty found in our local prairie lands.

These particular students are high-energy and have the ability to design and create wonderful things with their academic successes. The obstacle faced, however, is not having the resources needed to support their creativity. Teachers in our district work hard to think 'outside the box' to find ways to meet the students' needs the best we can, but the financial needs are greater than most teachers can work with.A common complaint I hear from my students at our class computer lab is how hard my chairs are. In the past year, my students and I have been working hard to build a classroom mini computer lab that we use during small group rotations. My students LOVE the lab, but find the chairs hard to sit in. This affects the overall learning environment which is the main reason for the lab in our classroom. My students have asked to a student-led project to write a grant for new seating, but they are too young to do this on their own. This project is an answer to their problem.

I teach in a small district that has one building that houses our 450 pre-K to grade twelve students. We are a truly a learning family! My kindergarten students love to move and I love to provide them with equipment and activities so they can develop their gross motor skills and learn to play cooperatively. We often have indoor recess during the winter months when the temperature outside is to cold for safe outdoor play. During a learning activity using recycled catalogs in the classroom, the children saw pictures of play equipment on the pages. They were so excited! They immediately made a list of things they could share at indoor recess and during choice time. I believe my students need intentional opportunities for physical development that will engage them for 60 minutes each day. Body awareness, balance, eye-hand coordination and the social and emotional growth that come with working with a partner and sharing are important skills for my kindergarten learners. We can accomplish this with equipment that challenges and engages them. Young children have so much energy that often adults wish they could bottle it! The equipment that our classroom is requesting for indoor recess will provide the children with ten stations for individual and partner play. By providing my students with these carefully selected learning tools, I can be intentional in fostering the development of physical skills like balance, body awareness and eye-hand coordination while they are engaged and working cooperatively. This equipment can be used daily to keep my students active. Some items can be used at recess and also in our classroom. The bean bags, balance beam, and hopscotch rug are versatile enough that they can be used in our classroom during choice time as well as at recess. The hula hoops, balls and jumpropes can be used inside or outside. Movement can be integrated into our curriculum in so many ways.

They experience instability in their home lives that contributes to their challenges at school. Despite these many challenges, my students are enthusiastic about school. They crave stability and want to be successful. Our program aims to create a safe and supportive community that teaches grade-level content alongside the social skills students need to be successful in school and in life. Students in my classroom need to wiggle and move, which can be difficult to do in a traditional classroom.

Often, these kids are new to our country, have limited English, or limited resources. Their amazing life experience teaches me daily and I love being able to share with them educational experiences as well. My teaching philosophy centers on helping students learn content through many ways, including art. I find that engaging students in art, science, and math in a real way helps them find a passionate drive to learn. I am lucky to set these kids off on their road to education and am proud to have kids leave my walls loving to learn. Students in my classroom thrive when their classroom is a mirror to their own experience, lives, and culture. By engaging families in a welcoming way, using culturally relevant materials and activities, like games and books will be providing easy and comfortable communication tools, I hope to engage all students in my diverse classroom. Projects in this proposal will follow developmental ideals that start with self-identity for kids. Art, like the people-color project and multicultural people-cut outs project will help kids develop a self-concept in race, culture, and learning, that will set them up for success throughout their school year. This engaging and relevant set of projects will not only teach academic concepts, but help students connect their academic space to their home culture and identity. By using multicultural literature, that mirrors the students in my classroom, I can help students see themselves as learners - those who are represented in classroom materials and models. Finally, the guided reading sets chosen are culturally relevant to the population served at Como Park Elementary, and allows for students to read about kids like themselves each and every day, making the classroom an accessible and welcoming place.

Although the community as a whole is poor, it doesn't stop the support we receive from parents, community leaders, churches, businesses, individuals, and others. Education is TREASURED by all stakeholders. The students want to use the drone and fitbit to measure and compare and contrast distances measured by air and land. As a learning facilitator, I will guide students to create paths to a location, travel there using the fitbit and drone, record data, and convert measurement units. Students will reason why the steps and calories vary from person to person and with our backyard including native Indian mounds, students can calculate heart rate and change when climbing to higher elevations. With the drone students will be made aware of possible obstacles in the land travel plans.

This is a description of my class of first graders. While I work at a Title I school with a high poverty rate, the dreams of my students are just as big as those of any other child. This does not diminish, however, some of the obstacles they face when they leave the four walls of our school. It is my hope to provide them with experiences and knowledge that will empower them beyond our classroom and instill in them the confidence and desire to be their best in all they do. In this technological age, I am always looking for new and inventive ways to keep my students motivated and engaged in their learning. With the achievement demands so great in 1st grade, it is imperative that students have a strong foundation in phonemic awareness and phonics. Without these skills, they are at a disadvantage when learning to read and process information. Throughout the day, students rotate through various independent learning stations to reinforce literacy skills and to connect their learning through authentic practice. Through the use of Amazon Fires, I feel the students would be excited about practicing skills they have learned in a different way. Students would have access to numerous apps and activities geared towards strengthening their skills in phonemic awareness, phonics, and reading. In addition to this, exposing students to Listen & Learn Phonemic Awareness activities and Vocabulary Folder Games enables them to learn by doing. These opportunities would be invaluable to my students. With your donation to this project, you are investing in the success of my students and ultimately improving the quality of their educational experiences.

They are highly inquisitive and eager to share their mathematical and scientific thinking. They love any chance for inquiry-based learning, where they can discover connections for themselves. Many scholars are English language learners, and having concrete and visual representations for different concepts in math and science will help them develop their academic vocabulary. Due to the size of my campus playground, my students are not able to have outdoor recess every day. They alternate having indoor recess, but we don't currently have the resources to make this engaging to the scholars. With these games, students will actually enjoy their indoor recess. As a bonus, they will further develop their social and emotional learning by practicing team work and sportsmanship. Most of the games require logic skills as well. One of our goals is to the develop each scholar as a whole being, and the development of social and emotional skills is critical to this. Many of the games also have underlying academic themes as well.

My class is a wonderfully diverse group of Native American, White, Hmong, Mexican, and Black students. Many of these students come from non-English speaking homes (Spanish and Hmong) and are working hard to learn two languages. We are a very happy family in my classroom and have grown close because of this diversity. My students are my kids. I have high standards and they come ready to meet them. They bring joy and courage with them. They persevere and challenge me to be my best because they deserve it. My students have often complained that sitting at their desks all day is tiresome and I completely agree! They have asked for extra recess. They have asked for movement breaks. When I asked them what would help them move and still focus enough to learn, they wanted flexible seating. We brainstormed together what that would look like. They came up with the idea of balance balls and wobble chairs. They believe if they can move, they will be more focused. Knowing that 25 balance balls and wobble chairs was a lot to ask, they agreed to share and to take turns. With the added 20 wobble cushions, every child will have access to movement while they learn. They are excited to move more and learn more.

I have highly motivated and hardworking students that are determined to leave their mark on the world. I am extremely proud to work with these students, and I expect great things out of them. I hope that DonorsChoose.org will help me support their education. Last year, my students began taking an interest in horticulture. We have completed an outside butterfly garden and successfully set up a very small aquaponics set-up in the classroom. The students, however, had to work in very large groups, and there was not enough plant material grown to do anything meaningful with it. The students suggested to me this summer that it would be a more meaningful experience for them if we were able to grow enough produce that we could actually consume it afterwards. I have heard of so many positive experiences from teachers over the years that have been able to promote good nutrition habits simply by allowing the students to be involved in the growing process themselves. I am excited to be able to give my students this opportunity. As this is a STEM class, I have also added an element of experimental design to this project. By requesting standard and LED grow lights, I am now able to allow students to compare growth rates and biomass of their plants along the way and seamlessly integrate STEM and nutrition education. I am excited to share this unique opportunity with my students. My project is requesting an LED grow light and a standard fluorescent grow light. My students asked me, 'Which light will work better for growing the plants?' and I responded with, 'Let's find out!'

They love hands-on learning and love taking their learning out into the community through service learning projects and project based learning. One of our most popular teachers this past school year was a teacher who did yoga with small groups of students. This teacher worked to share calming skills with students who struggled to self-regulate. Students who weren't chosen to go were very jealous of these students. In order to share yoga with more and more students, several teachers attended Yoga Calm training this summer. This training will allow these teachers to share yoga with many different classrooms and students. Whole class yoga will give students a shared language to add movement throughout the day so students can stay energized to learn. The materials that we are requesting are materials that would travel throughout the building and be shared with many classrooms. The books and cards would be used as resources to help introduce yoga to students. The mats offer a way to entice students and excite them to learn movement that might be new or scary.

The students come from areas that do not always allow for programs and clubs, so to help keep them active in the classroom, while also challenging them in the classroom, these items are valuable. Our district is very diverse; in fact, my particular school is the most diverse elementary school in Oakland County, and would benefit from exercise equipment to keep them challenged mentally and physically. My kids attack work and projects vigorously, and will remain better focused with the exercise equipment. My students have long asked for creative ways to exercise at no expense to their learning. They have said, 'It is too long to sit in my desk. Can we move around as long as we still do our Math?' One even said, 'At my old school the teacher let us bounce and wiggle on cushions and a big rubber band while we did our work.' So, they inspired both the investigation into what these items were and this request for items to help the kids sustain focus in the classroom while also staying physically active. Because of our diversity and clientele, the students often can lose focus and let their minds wander. The wobble cushions will engage their core muscles so they exercise while concentrating on their work. The bouncy bands also allow the kids to exercise their feet and legs and stay active while doing desk work. The exercise equipment will be vital to their learning. The students will easily surpass sixty minutes a day of exercise, physically increasing blood flow and cardio as they complete their class work. My especially diverse student population needs to be challenged in the classroom while staying physically active. In doing both at the same time, they will have better attention, learn valuable information, and retain information better throughout the day. This will help the students not only in the classroom, but also at home and in the community. The students will inspire and challenge each other to be more fit, and as they become more fit, their energy and enthusiasm will increase as staff members work with them on the playground and in extra curricular sport activities. They will also challenge each other peer to peer in competition to complete their class work while using the exercise equipment.

Many are learning to speak English for the first time, even as they continue to develop and master their native tongues at home. There are over a dozen languages and dialects represented in our school. This, along with the long hours of school and after school program enrollments, severely limit time available for social interactions and the formation of meaningful friendships outside of school. In every grade, there are students with special needs and all of the children are working hard to meet our newly adopted and rigorous Common Core-based curriculum. What is more amazing than all of this, however, is the dedication these students show day in and day out as they strive to reach all of their personal, social, and academic goals. Physical Education class time is always one of the highlights of my students' day. These fun-filled, high energy periods represent uninterrupted gross motor play and opportunities for moving big muscles.

Movement actually allows for alertness and attention. Wobble Chairs and cushions play an important roll in student focus. In response to the chair's instability, the body instinctively engages its core muscles. Constant movement is required in order to stay seated on the chair, and that movement helps students focus. With wobble chairs and cushions, students feel less fidgety and more relaxed and are better able to concentrate. As we move into different ways of learning along with high expectations, students need choices about how they engage in classroom seating options. They need the best possible physical environment to keep them focused. My students came up with this project after we visited the preschool classroom. Our preschoolers had these chairs and cushions and my first graders fell in love with them and asked me to get them for my classroom.

We are all one 'class,' and teachers share students, and students share teachers interchangeably. Our goal is success for each student. We understand that success looks different for each student, so we focus on personalized learning. Personalized learning lets each student work at their own pace and at their own level. We also focus on preparing students for the 21st century and the future by allowing for extensive opportunities with Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math. The Studio and our STEAM focus allows for more small group and individualized time for students, which benefits everyone. Due to our large Studio, we have many transitions throughout the day from one space to another. Students spend a lot of time doing individualized tasks and independent work, as well as working in small groups with one of their teachers. Specifically, Literacy time is broken down between whole group lesson, independent reading time, and small group time. Each time we transition to a new portion of the Literacy block, students need to bring their reading materials with them to wherever they are going. Having these easily transportable and durable book bins for students to store their books and reading materials in will make transitions easier and therefore allow for more reading time- the ultimate goal! Reading is a special part of a child's development, and working with a group of students who may not have a large selection of books at home, we want to promote the love for reading in our classroom. These book bins will help organize materials and ease transitions which allows for a smooth and enjoyable reading time for each student!

Our students are readers, writers, creators, and dreamers. Our students face challenges both in and out of the classroom, however they continue to be resilient with their academic, social, and emotional well-being. Despite the many challenges they face, we aim to create classrooms that will engage, excite and motivate them to succeed. Our shared goal is to create classrooms that are a reflection of us all. Our students represent the diverse community surrounding our school. They are children of immigrants and children of long-time residents. They speak multiple languages and represent cultures from all over the world. Nearly 80% of them receive free or reduced-price lunch. Many of them will be the first in their families to attend college- ask any of them and they'll tell you that's where they're headed! Our school is a unique and wonderful community of involved families, committed leadership, and passionate teachers. We have our share of challenges, but we support one another and act as a team with one goal in mind- the success of our students. Donations to this project will impact both how our students learn and what they learn. All items on this list were suggested by fifth grade students. With the items donated to our classrooms, our students will enter their classrooms each day to a calming, welcoming, and healthy environment. Having alternative choices for seating will allow students to choose the type of seating that best fits their learning style to maximize their learning engagement and wellness. For example, pedal chairs will help kinesthetic learners move their bodies throughout the day and maintain their focus. The pillows and alternative seats will allow students to be comfortable and focused on their learning. Having water bottles near their desks will encourage students to properly fuel their bodies and brains throughout the day. A mini fridge will enable us to provide healthy snack options especially for students who do not always have access to healthy food options outside of school. Students who are comfortable in their environment will be more excited to be in school and their overall well-being will improve!","My students need flexible seating for sustained focus, water bottles to stay hydrated, and a refrigerator.","Health & Sports, Literacy & Language",Grades 3-5,Supplies,965.2,Fully Funded

There is a definite need for outside support for our students. The free and reduced price lunch population at my school is 62.5 percent. My students will form teams and then together they will research companies, analyze data and make informed decisions about which stocks to purchase. Then they will review data along with current news stories and be able to decide how long to keep this stock. Students will use the internet, news articles, magazines and other resources to help them make their decisions. The Stock Market Game allows my students to use $100,00.00 to learn to trade in a safe environment. In the past, one student asked, 'You mean people do this in real life with real money?'

One hundred percent of my students receive free breakfast and lunch. I serve a unique group of learners with a wide range of abilities, passions, and strengths. Some struggle with learning disabilities, dyslexia, autism, and emotional needs. While my students face a lot of challenges daily, their never-ending desire to learn is inspiring. My students love to investigate, explore, wonder, and discover. Our school's mission is to provide an education that is deeply rooted in the arts (visual art, music, dance, and theater) and which integrates the arts into core subject areas. My students are active and full of energy. They need frequent and regular opportunities to wiggle, move, dance, run, or otherwise add movement to their day. My students are looking for more opportunities to increase their physical activity while learning in the classroom. My summer-school group was in awe when they learned about stand-up desks and how they can increase fitness levels and focus. They have asked for these desks so that they can stand, march in place, or wiggle while they work. My students are setting goals to aim for a minimum of 60 minutes of physical activity each day, and with Alphabetter Stand-Up Desks, they can achieve this goal within the classroom. According to a study performed by Dr. Mercola, '[e]xercise increases the number of connections between your neurons and new neuronal growth in your brain.' Not only can standing desks help students make greater academic gains, but there is evidence that standing desks can increase productivity, improve mood and energy levels, and reduce the risk of certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure. I hope to give each of my students an opportunity to use the standing desks during work time each day. This year we are setting class goals for 60 minutes of physical activity each day, and my students believe that these desks will be beneficial and allow them to move while learning. In our brainstorm session, my students and I discussed the importance of staying hydrated, especially during periods of increased physical activity. We are requesting reusable water bottles so that my students can stay properly hydrated while we work to increase our physical fitness levels. We will use the bottles daily.

Our Middle School students rotate through classes, so I teach two sections of Science and 2 sections of English Language Arts each day. I love teaching 5th grade - my students are independent, creative and they love learning as much I love teaching them! I have been blessed to be able to develop relationships with these kids and impact their lives, creating a positive introduction to their middle school careers. This fall, I will again have a group of 94 lively and wonderful students! They will eagerly be anticipating their experiences now as new middle school students. Our school is in a rural area and has a high poverty level. With decreasing funding for education, it is becoming harder and harder to provide students with the supplies they need and deserve. My classroom is currently set up as a science classroom, with out-of-date lab tables and chairs. I find that some students often lean back in their chairs, because moving helps them concentrate. Other students cannot learn well at all sitting down, so ask to stand up at my counter in order to work more efficiently. While I often allow one student at a time do this, it doesn't work well since the counter is where Science labs or other projects are set up. Kids all have different learning styles and they need the tools to support the way they best learn. Flexible seating options like Stand-Up Desks and Wobble Chairs would be an awesome way to help students find a comfortable way to learn the way they learn best. It will help them also to be more active while learning, which research shows greatly improves student concentration. This project is kid-inspired because on multiple occasions they have come up to me and asked if they can sit or stand in different areas of the classroom, in short, they are asking for flexible seating options! I would love to be able to give them that option - it would both encourage and inspire my kids, helping them concentrate to do their best work.

I am always eager to see how each student contributes to the positive classroom experience. My students continually desire the niceties that are typically found are other high schools. My students are always coming up with new ideas and new innovations that would make their high school experience better. They know how important it is that they remember these four years as time for them to explore new things and join the world as global citizens. Every senior in my high school takes physical education class as part of their graduation requirements. Students often lament that they don't have more options to fill these requirements. At the same time, there is currently a Yoga Club in our school that sees some of the most robust attendance around stressful times such as exams and the holidays. For my students, yoga is a means of relaxing their busy minds and finding 60 minutes of peace and quiet. Many students experience trauma and crisis at home, then are expected to come to school ready to learn. My students would like to take the success of the Yoga Club and bring it to a full year elective that seniors can take in place of physical education. It is my hope that by exposing more students to Yoga, we can begin to bring more peace and relaxation to seniors during a busy time of year. This project will bring in a classroom set of yoga mats, a collection of DVD's and CD's to help facilitate the class, and a set of books for one of our teachers to learn more about Yoga and teach the class.","My students need yoga mats, dvds, and CDs for mind/body relaxation.",Health & Sports,Grades 9-12,Supplies,973.11,Fully Funded

Despite the trauma and poverty they may face outside of school, our room is a safe, welcoming community. Here are the stats: 88% free and reduced lunch, 99% students of color, 64% English Learners. The most important statistic is 95% family satisfaction. Our teachers, scholars, and families have high expectations for themselves and each other. We use a growth mindset, using our failures not as things to be ashamed of but to work through and grow from. With that being said, the school and families have and have had many challenges. I seek to create a classroom environment where every child has differentiated instruction and the resources needed to be successful learners. This project will fund my reading and listening centers. My school's goal is to have all children learn to read by grade 3. Giving the scholars a variety of experiences in reading gives them a greater opportunity to succeed in literacy. Each child comes from different learning styles, interests, and language challenges. I seek to meet the individual instructional needs of all students. Utilizing independent reading through an inviting, interest-based reading center will enhance motivation and encourage lifelong readers. We need a listening center, pillows, and read-along library. The listening center will help scholars to see how the words on the page can come alive in a fluid, expressive way. The center helps the scholars focus on the sounds of words read without interruption and provides a model of fluent reading. Audio books also give them an important introduction to listening which is a skill that the children must master in order to learn to read.

They need to have the opportunity to wiggle during the school day. I am forever trying to find ways to teach all of my students and keep them fully engaged in the learning process. I teach in a Title I, high poverty school. My kindergartners live in a small, rural community. Our school houses pre-kindergarten through 2nd grade. They come to school to have fun and feel valued. My students want to be able to complete their daily work because they want to be responsible and please their teacher and parents. This can be difficult for five and six year old children who need to sit comfortably or wiggle around as they perform daily tasks. Usually, wiggles can be spent during gym time or recess, but that isn't always enough for all students. Young learners find it taxing to be successful sitting in a traditional manner in the classroom all day. My students ask why they need to sit in traditional chairs, and if they can sit in various places in the classroom. They often want to stretch, flex, and move during work times, however, they are limited given our current classroom set up. I would like to give him the opportunity to sit comfortably while strengthening his core and stretching his muscles. This will allow students to attend for longer periods of time and practice healthy habits at the same time during our literacy and math times, which amount to 90 minutes per day.

What would happen if you were furious at work and couldn't stop from lashing out at your colleagues? What would happen if you were nervous at the doctor’s office and couldn't stop crying? Self-regulation is the ability to monitor, evaluate, and modify one's emotional reactions. It is key to being able to function as and adult in the community including post-secondary education and employment. Unfortunately these skills, which may seem easy for you, are very difficult for many teens and adults with disabilities. Due to their disabilities, they are not able to understand their emotions, identify appropriate reactions, and cope on their own. This prevents them from being employed and participating in the community. These are the skills I am trying to target and teach to my students. I am a special education teacher teaching life skill and job skill classes to senior students ages 18 - 22. My students have Intellectual disabilities along with a wide range of other disabilities including Autism, traumatic brain injury, physical disabilities, etc. There are two important programs to teach these key self-regulation skills. One is through the Me Moves DVD. Me Moves is a research based program to help children and adults self-regulate their emotions through movement. The DVD is designed to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, providing the user with an effective tool for self regulation in only a few minutes. Using it for a few minutes in a day day decreases stress, improves mood, and enhances one’s ability to focus. The other research based program is Zones of Self Regulation. The Zones of Self-Regulation posters will help my students learn the key components of self-regulation including monitoring one's own emotions and finding ways to cope.

Many of my students' families will never have additional money to purchase educational materials; therefore, I hope to be able to provide a fun and interesting way of learning so my students can succeed in life. We are very active in our class and my students want a way to be able to get some movement and fitness into their day. I quickly realized that my students enjoy when we take quick brain breaks to stretch or do some yoga breathing activities. I have asked my students what would make them most comfortable while learning and growing together in the classroom. They have expressed the need and want for movement while they work. This project was inspired by my amazing students. I'd like to provide my young learners with hokki stools that allow them to get some fitness, strengthening and help them get their wiggles out so that they can focus on learning.

Here is a chance to give young learners a chance to grab onto literacy and run with it. Who wouldn't want a chance to change the world by learning while having fun and being challenged? Second graders are eager and impressionable learners. They strive to learn more every day. In a class with an average of 30 students, my students deserve one on one time with me, their teacher, as well as opportunities to work independently and with small groups. By donating to my second grade class, you will ultimately be changing the world. The donated materials will allow my students to engage in hands-on and fun games and activities that aid in building a solid foundation for literacy. Nelson Mandela once said, 'Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.' Let's give my students who come from low income homes a chance at a successful future. I will use this project to support my students in learning to read in write during our literacy block. During Daily 5, students are given a choice of activities and games. These materials will allow the class to have fun, challenging, and engaging activities to practice building that important reading foundation. Furthermore, the materials will allow students to work independently, with a partner, in small groups, or with a teacher. By incorporating more opportunities to practice phonics, comprehension, fluency, and vocabulary during our literacy block, my students should improve in all areas of reading. For example the folder games are simple and independent activities that allow for self checking and extra practice in phonics and grammar. The writing tiles will be used in the Work on Writing choice for Daily 5. With these various new materials, students will be given opportunities to work on many aspects of literacy.

Some of my students are homeless and often hungry. They take care of brothers and sisters and act as translators for their parents. However, they almost always turn up at my door ready to learn and with a smile on their face. They all deserve the best I can give them. Our classroom is too small for the 30+ bodies we have. Finding space for students to move around is hard. We spill out into the hallway. We make it work. We laugh a lot. We learn a lot. Sometimes I dance. Sometimes we all dance. We just dance in a really small space. These stools will enable me to move out some of the traditional hard plastic chairs and create more space. They are light enough they can be carried easily, which means the space is more flexible. Different students learn best in different positions, or they need to move in order to stay focused. The stools allow students to do this. Giving students a choice is very important in helping them feel valued.

This coming year, I am so excited to meet my students and see the array of different cultures, abilities, talents, and traits that will highlight my 2nd-grade classroom. Every school year, I begin by making sure my classroom includes 3 important characteristics: safe for all learners, bright and eye-catching (for student engagement), and comfortable. My students should be able to come to class each and every day and be excited to learn, comfortable to expand their minds and think outside the box (environmentally and socially speaking), and feel safe enough to open up and be a creative thinker and sharer. In such a diverse community of learners, I am able to really build our classroom around the students' cultures and backgrounds. I learn so much about others and in turn, I learn about myself through the eyes of each student. Teaching is my passion, but I will always consider learning to be my life.

This year I will have 25 students in my classroom. Our school does not have air conditioning so it is hard to keep the students focused during the hot days back to school. I recently contained my masters in Teaching and Learning, and did my research on Movement in the Classroom. With this research, I concluded that movement while learning is essential for students to be able to stay focus and retain information. Students were less distracted and were less fidgety while learning. I was able to witness a huge change in both my students and my classroom atmosphere. During my research, I implemented different movement breaks every 20 minutes and allowed students to work standing, leaning against tables, laying on the ground, or whatever was comfortable to them. It was the best decision I have made in my five years of teaching. When I first implemented my research ,my students loved the movement they were receiving throughout their lesson. They were no longer sitting in their desk for long periods of time and they were able to stay focused for longer. My students said they saw less distractions in the classroom while learning and they were able to retain information easier. I was so happy with their response to my research and that they were able to notice the same results as me! They also enjoyed being able to learn while moving instead of sitting stationary all the time. Not only did my students notice a change but the parents did also.

My students have requested the tricycles in this project to help them become more active and be able to develop large muscles. My students want to learn how to master riding a tricycle so that they can eventually learn to ride a 2 wheeler. We are requesting these materials so that they can learn to develop larger muscles, balance and coordination.

My students experience a large range of academic needs. One way to meet the needs of all students is to create an environment that promotes collaboration and student choice. My students come from hard working families in a high poverty part of the city. English is spoken as a second language in most families. My students have unlimited enthusiasm and strive to give their best each and every day. I want my students to be engaged by having unique and exciting resources. My students have been requesting for more options when it comes to seating at their desk. With the Hokki stools, students can sway and wiggle on these stools and not disrupt the other students. My students will be able to move around and be comfortable while still remaining focused. These stools will give the most active students the opportunity to be under control yet active during classroom lessons and activities. These Hokki stools are a great way to combine learning and exercise. Students sit for the majority of the day and these stools will help them remain active even while sitting. The convex base allows for movement in all directions. These chairs also help the students build core strength. A classroom should be a comfortable place. My students will be able to stay focused and not worry about getting told to stop rocking the chair because it is not safe. My ultimate goal would be to have a stool for each student in my class. By donating to this project, you will be allowing the students that have difficulty sitting still in class, the chance to move around while still learning.

Our students are readers, writers, creators, and dreamers. Our students face challenges both in and out of the classroom; however, they continue to be resilient with their academic, social, and emotional well-being. Despite the many challenges they face, we aim to create classrooms that will engage, excite, and motivate them to succeed. Our shared goal is to create classrooms that are a reflection of us all. Our students represent the diverse community surrounding our school. They are children of immigrants and children of long-time residents. They speak multiple languages and represent cultures from all over the world. Nearly 80% of them receive free or reduced-price lunch. Many of them will be the first in their families to attend college- ask any of them and they'll tell you that's where they're headed! Our school is a unique and wonderful community of involved families, committed leadership, and passionate teachers. We have our share of challenges, but we support one another and act as a team with one goal in mind- the success of our students. Donations to this project will impact both how our students learn and what they learn. All items on this list were suggested by fifth grade students. With the items donated to our classrooms, our students will enter their classrooms each day to a calming, welcoming, and healthy environment. Having alternative choices for seating will allow students to choose the type of seating that best fits their learning style to maximize their learning engagement and wellness. For example: pedal chairs will help kinesthetic learners move their bodies throughout the day and maintain their focus. The pillows and alternative seats will allow students to be comfortable and focused on their learning. Having water bottles near their desks will encourage students to properly fuel their bodies and brains throughout the day. A large majority of our student population live in trailers behind the school, take vans to and from homeless shelters, or are between homes. Having access to clean, fresh water all day will help them stay hydrated and focused!

They have asked me over and over again when can we ask for some more wiggle stools? The students using the stools are so focused during work time. They move just enough to get the wiggles out but don't distract others. While sitting in the stools, the students muscles are constantly engaged. Students have to keep balanced on the stool, or they'll fall off. They have learned to take responsibility to pass the stools on to their neighbor, and then they have to wait almost two weeks to use it again.

I feel privileged to be their teacher and will do whatever I can to give them the learning environment and experiences they so deserve.I was introduced to the idea of alternative seating last spring. To be honest, my first response was, 'How is it not chaos?', but, I did a trial run with the kids, and was pleasantly surprised to see the collaboration, behavior improvement (less off-task chatting) and focus that occurred. Being able to choose or change seats is such a simple idea to enhance learning and cooperation - yet not the usual option in classrooms. Research, talks with colleagues, and many Pinterest pins have convinced me that this is a no-brainer.

My students want to move as they learn! This project is their way of trying to solve that problem. They have seen other students using ball chairs, wiggle seats, balance boards and standing desks. They have expressed a need and want for those items, as well. They ask, 'Why don't we have those items?' Their solution to the problem is ask for support.

There have been several students that have talked to me about their interest in cooking, and have told me that they would really like to learn how to cook. Our school does not offer home economics so these students have not learned many cooking skills, or information about nutrition. Many of my students do not have healthy eating habits, because they have not been taught how to eat and prepare healthy food.

They will want to feel important and will share their thoughts with anyone who will listen. They will strive to be independent. It is my job as an educator to make sure these students have the very best first school experience!A typical kindergarten classroom does not have desks to organize the student's belongings. My old classroom had a fabulous large cubby for the students to independently manage all of their supplies and learning materials. Unfortunately, my new classroom does not have this wonderful piece of furniture. My current classroom is in need of a large cubby where each student will have their own spot to put items such as their school supply box, reading books, writing journal, whisper phone, math journal, and all their special projects and work. Currently, I have to house all of these items in bins scattered around my classroom. This becomes visual clutter and a management nightmare! The challenging part is the time it takes for me to individually pass out the items every time we need them. If you know anything about kindergarten students, you know they do not have the attention span to wait long. We have to keep things moving!!!If there was a large cubby in my classroom the students could take care of all their own items.

I may not be able to help them with their home lives, however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day. By doing this in a creative and positive way, I am hopeful to inspire even our earliest learners to continue on a path of academic excellence. My kids deserve everything they want and more! They want some fun seating! So I intend to try to get them just that!My kids want some good seating options. They said 'they want Hokki stools and yoga balls.' I thought that yoga balls would be to unsafe until I saw they come with chairs too! How awesome would that be to have these chairs for my kids. They would be so excited to sit in something comfortable for a change. They have asked me several times to get them Hokki stools and balance disks. They have also asked for yoga balls and I was very hesitant but they talked me into it!I want to give my students everything they want and more! They would be so surprised if I showed up with Hokki stools and yoga balls! Having these alternate seating options in my classroom will give my students extra added activity in the classroom, giving them extra movement and core stabilization to focus more on learning.

These students need resources to help them be more active. My students love to move and to be active when they learning! A lot of my students fidget at their seats because they want to be active. I would love to get these under the desk pedals to give them the opportunity to move their legs while they are learning. An in class trampoline would also be a wonderful opportunity for students to be rewarded and it be a healthy reward. In class this year, we have discussed how we can be more active and involve more movement in our learning. I asked the kids for ideas on what they thought would work best to give them the best learning experiences. One of my students said another teacher had a trampoline that they got to jump on when they did something great. Another student said sometimes I just can't keep my feet still. Students also mentioned the need to get up and move sometimes. A healthy and active learning experience will let students excel at whatever they put their mind to! The students being involved in decision making ,such as letting me know what they thought was needed, got me to thinking about how I could get these supplies for my students. My students wanted me to ask for something to keep their feet moving, some learning songs they could dance to, and a trampoline they could jump on. My students will be able to stay on task by getting to be active by moving their legs on the pedals. They will also work on getting recognition for great achievement so that they can have a turn jumping on the trampoline. The students would easily be able to achieve 60 minutes of physical activity in a day by using the under desk pedals and the trampoline, and learning songs that include movement . This project is very important since the students came up with the idea themselves about what they thought would make them more successful. Through this project my students will achieve higher success in their learning as well as be healthier and more active. These will help the students that have a harder time focusing.

They are leaders in their families, and their commitment to education is powerful. Each day, they refine their self-control and deepen their commitment to becoming tomorrow's leaders. A healthy student balances social, academic, and personal goals. The strong commitment my students have to education often increases their stress levels. In several students, this can lead to a mismanagement of anxiety and anger. My students are constantly asking about my own self-care, and several have even requested breath work and body movement as an incentive when class goals are met or as a close of the day process.

We live in a high poverty rural community and are a Title I school where all of the children in our school receive free breakfast and lunch. Many of my students live in households where their families are just barely getting by. Some of them don't have basic necessities. These children are all very deserving and my wish for them is to be successful in all areas of life, despite their circumstances. First graders are full of energy from morning to night! They can't wait for time to go outside to the playground where they can run, jump and climb. But in inclement weather and during the winter months when we can't go outside, they still need a way to get some much needed exercise. Recently on a rainy day at school, my students asked what we were going to do since we couldn't go outside for playtime. Unfortunately we don't have access to equipment that allow children some movement during the day when we have to miss playtime. When I explained that we didn't have anything for active indoor play, my students began asking questions about what we would do in the wintertime when it was too cold to go outside. They started thinking of some things they might be able to use inside and came up with many suggestions. Their ideas included balls, jump ropes, ring toss games, balance ball chairs and balance stepping buckets. In addition to the great health benefits of exercise, children who are active also show improvement in motor skills development. Research shows growing evidence that physical activity and academic achievement go hand-in-hand. I would like to provide my students with the things they asked for, but with limited funding it's not possible.

This unexpected weather storm has given them a setback. Help our students get a fresh start to the school year. This year we are focusing on being more organized since third grade is where they first begin switching classes at my school. We just need help in making the materials easier to keep up with and put back in place. This will enable the students to become more responsible with their supplies, and they will be able to quickly get started in their different areas of focus. The donations to this project will not only help to improve my student's attention and focus, but also build their confidence as mathematicians, inventors, authors, and illustrators. The materials being requested will help the Math Workshop run more effectively in class. Each student will be able to easily find their composition notebooks, pencils, and dry erase markers inside their heavy duty paper trays. The write and wipe pockets will be placed in focus areas, according to the needs of the students. The colors will make it easier for students to find displayed math options. Also, color coding will help them think about what choices to make about the activities, appropriate manipulatives, problem solving strategies, games for fact practice, strategies for solving equations, detailed explanations, inquiry engineering, and different representations. Research shows how math workshop can be used to give numerous opportunities students need to practice effectively listening, speaking, writing, creating, collaborating, and thinking critically. These skills will ensure the students are ready to face the challenges of higher education and the work environment. We need your help to make this a reality.

We are a neighborhood school serving mainstream students as well as many bilingual students who are learning English. Some of our students have recently arrived in the United States and did not have an opportunity to attend school before. About 86% of our students receive free and reduces lunches. Our students come to first grade eager for learning. Music, activity and movement helps our students to be the best learners they can be. They love to dance and jump run in place to the music. A classroom rug is a center for learning and activity in the classroom. My students need a classroom rug so that each child can find a personal space for moving, learning, and building community. We gather there each morning for Morning Meeting. Throughout the day we take breaks to get kids moving and fired up for learning. We run in place, jump, pretend to swim, roll our arms in large circles, and dance to music. Each child needs to find a personal space to move freely without bumping into furniture and other students. The rug our class is requesting is divided into individual squares large enough for each child to be safe and free to move. It is also divided into colors, which helps us turn the activity into a game: “Red squares, run in place! Blue squares, jump on one foot!” The frequent activity breaks for movement provide our students an opportunity for fun and exercise and to release the incredible energy they have inside. Children learn the activity breaks and then 1-2 children lead the activity . Children are taught how these activities help their brain get ready for learning. After a few minutes of activity, our students are ready for reading and math. Each learner finds a square on the carpet for a lesson. The squares help them to find a partner to talk about their learning and ask and answer questions. Socializing, talking, and moving are important for learning in first grade. We also have regular times throughout the day, especially after lunch and recess when students need help calming down. We use yoga calming movements to help our students learn to regulate their high energy to calm themselves. The individual squares on the rug will help our students find a safe personal space.","My students need a new classroom rug that is clean and appealing, so we can gather on it throughout the day in small groups and large groups during learning times.",Literacy & Language,Grades PreK-2,Supplies,607.27,Fully Funded

The vast majority are from Native American families who all reside on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Little Wound strives to affirm Lakota identity and culture in the classroom and also emphasizes the importance of athletics in the community and tribe. The Little Wound middle and high schools both employ Lakota language instructors and work to support students as individuals with unique identities. In the middle school we work as a small staff of about 16 teachers, councilors, supports staff, and administration to ensure our Lakota students have access to an education that will benefit their family, community, and tribe. Kindles will allow students to read independently with this new form of technology that many find more appealing than paperback books. Students that struggle with independent reading need barriers to reading removed while also finding new incentives that offer novelty and fun to the experience. E-readers are popular among kids and adults, and now my students can try one out in the classroom. Plus, Kindles can access more books than could ever fit into my classroom. With a single Kindle and a year of Kindle Unlimited, students can access over 1 million titles right from the classroom and be exposed to a new option for summer reading, when books are less accessible to the community. Kindles are quite inexpensive and students may learn to love using one in the classroom, and seek to acquire a Kindle, and the vast potential it offers, outside of school.","My students need Kindle Fire tablets to read books that are not in our library, and to be introduced to a great way to read during the summers when books are unavailable.",Literacy & Language,Grades 6-8,Technology,264.51,Fully Funded

Their desire to learn and catch up to speed with the grade level requirements is what is moving us into the 21st Century learning. We are a 5th grade room full or energetic, curious learners! We have flexible seating, which makes it possible for each student to find a spot where he or she learns the best. Some like to sit on the floor, some like to stand...

I see student motivation, energy levels and engagement changing for the better, as their bodies are not stiff and tired of sitting the whole day. They will learn better when feeling refreshed and recharged. The ideas came to the students on a cold Chicago winter day - another one with the indoor recess. They returned to the classroom with zero energy for the afternoon. We started a class discussion on how this problem can be solved, and a student suggested having some sports equipment in the classroom. As we eliminated some of the obviously impractical options, a suggestion came through: 'How about a table tennis table? We could have a tournament!' The cheers followed, and then another great idea was heard:'Ms. Madas, if we have Fitbits like you, then we can walk and track our steps. Even when we run in Gym!'. Next, we turned our attention to the good weather and planned for soccer, badminton and volleyball. It was amazing to see what great energy was created in the classroom and feel energized!

We have the privilege of working with students from many different backgrounds, experiences, and interests. Because my students have a variety of preferred learning styles, and are at different levels of academic readiness, it is imperative that I find ways to differentiate in my classroom, not just in my instruction. It is my job to make connections and understand each student and to use this understanding to deliver instruction that honors individual differences. My students deserve an equal opportunity to learn in an environment where they are comfortable and their needs are met. Our school values the individuality and learning styles of each and every Gator. In order to help foster a true love for learning, students need to be empowered to make choices that help them be their best learners, collaborators, and thinkers. That learning, collaborating, and thinking does not always happen while sitting at a desk. In order to engage and empower students to take ownership of their learning, they need the autonomy to choose seating that allows for movement, collaboration, and differentiation. This project will provide my students with the opportunity to select the type of seating that helps them focus and learn best. The pod seats, rugs, stools, lap desks, and foam mats will provide a variety of work space opportunities for students and will move away from the old-school mentality that all students must be instructed at their desks.

Over half of the students in our district receive free and reduced lunch. The students in my room present a wide array of abilities and needs. Many of my students display sensory needs. Although they face many challenges, my nine students are always working to better themselves and their school. They are incredibly hard workers and constantly impress me with their 'can do' attitudes. Functional skills that students can apply to their daily lives are a main focus of our day. My goal is to make everything relevant to them and their needs. Outside of the classroom, the students develop job skills while giving back to their school and community. They volunteer around the school by mentoring elementary students and shadowing the custodians. Once a week, they volunteer in the community, learning job skills at local businesses. My students all have special needs. Many of them exhibit sensory needs that interfere with their learning. Some students can become distracted or anxious by lights, sounds, and smells. They need frequent breaks to move around or go to a quiet, dark area to relax when they become overstimulated by their surroundings. Overhead fluorescent lights contribute to these problems and can cause headaches, eyestrain, and anxiety in students sensitive to sensory input. These light filters cut the glare of fluorescent lights to create a comfortable learning environment for all students. They lessen the harshness of fluorescent lights by filtering them to a softer, blue glow. This minimizes the distraction and discomfort that many students face and allows them to focus on what is really important--learning! Studies have also shown that blue is a calming color.

Our mission is to engage and enrich all students' by developing critical thinking and problem solving skills, and empowering them to achieve their personal, academic, and community goals. Drumming is not only a way for individuals to make music and be creative, but is becoming increasingly popular as a way to manage stress and promote physical and emotional health. Often times, students do not have the tools to deal with the stress and challenges they face at school and in their personal lives and do not know how to be proactive, only reactive. Drumming can help students focus, relieve stress and aggression, express emotions that are hard to articulate verbally and build community among one another. It's fun, convenient, inclusive, and allows students to take on leaderships roles within the group. And like many schools and districts that have done away with art and music due to budget cuts, drumming provides a creative break during the academic day. More from writer Dave Robertson: 'Drumming does not require advanced physical abilities or specialized talents. It does not require participants to read music or understand music theory. Drumming, even a simple pattern, offers benefits to a huge range of people. Drumming is a universal language. It transcends gender, race, age, and nationality. In fact, nearly every culture on earth has some form of drumming tradition. Studies have shown that drumming lowers both blood pressure and stress hormones. The active component of drumming helps reduce stress in a number of ways. Group drumming creates a sense of community and a powerful shared experience. It has been used as a successful team building experience to teach groups to work together, to listen to each other, and to achieve common goals.'

They live within blocks of the school, with usually more than 5 people in their household. We are a tight knit community, in fact I was raised in this neighborhood. My students are very energetic and really enjoy learning. They come in speaking both English and Spanish. As a teacher, I take their knowledge and prior experiences of their dominant language to develop the English language. It's amazing to see how well these little individuals can dominate two languages. They hold such a great power and they don't even know it. Starting kindergarten can be very scary for students and even parents. Therefore, it is important that the teacher creates a warm and welcoming environment for the students. Giving students a carpet will make them feel comfortable and it is inviting to walk into. Some of the most important daily routines will happen on this carpet such as morning message, calendar time, phonemic awareness time, and read-alouds. It is essential to have a carpet because on this carpet is where students develop oral and listening skills. Not to mention, a carpet in the classroom can reduce/cushion slips and falls.

The children really enjoyed learning yoga poses and practicing each pose. The students are always more calm and focused after our mini yoga session. The students would like yoga mats and a yoga for kids DVD so that they can continue to learn new yoga poses and calming strategies.

However, my students come to school each day, excited and ready to learn and work their hardest! My classroom serves a very wide variety of learners! Some of the learners in my classroom have various sensory and movement needs.

I have always allowed students to stand, sit, and lay on the floor if that's how they felt they could accomplish their very best work! However, this past year, many students said they wished they could bounce on a yoga ball. So, naturally, I thought that was an amazing idea, which is why I am requesting the yoga ball chair. Many students told me they like to move and rock in their chairs. I always understand, however it's not safe to rock in their chairs. So after exploring my options, I believe the Learniture Active stools will give my students a safe alternative to move and rock while they work.

I am asking for a rocking/reading chair, engaging 'just right' books, book storage, and big books. My students need engaging books that are culturally relevant and at their reading level to help them develop a love of reading.

From apps to research websites , technology is a key motivator in my speech room. Positive reinforcement, visual models, and auditory prompts are the main aspects to the therapy that I provide. All of these key components can be used along with a laptop to facilitate learning and success. Currently, we have no working computer in the speech therapy room which inhibits my students from learning at their absolute highest potential. Yet, they still come to speech therapy every day, ready to learn! They are very determined in all that they do which is why they are so special to me. This will be my first official full year of being a speech therapist in the DOE and nothing would excite me more than to provide my students with something as motivating as a laptop.I am requesting a MacBook Air for my students who receive speech-language therapy.

Because we were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, many of the computers and desktops that are being used are either outdated or no longer working to their fullest potential. Many of the students that are receiving therapy do not have access to technology such as a computer at home due to the low-income area that they live in.

I had other kids raise their hands and say, I like Peppers in my Salsa, a Hmong student mentioned that he has sweet tomatoes in their own grown salsa. I had a hmong student whose parents do Farmer's Market every saturday say my family could donate some seeds for the garden. The students are loving this idea of having a school grown salsa garden here at school. They can't wait to watch it grown and then share in having a salsa party after the garden grows. My students will develop skills to be able to grown a garden of their own some day. We are teaching them a life long skill to be able to grow vegetables and herbs to make a Salsa garden. A academic skill is stress relieving. We also have team-work and life-long skill of learning how to grow a garden and be able to feed your family through a garden. We will also deal with problem solving on where to put the seeds in the garden, we will need to research how long certain vegetable take to grow and how much sun light they will need. A lot of life-long skills and survival skills are learned in growing a garden. The kids are so excited about a Salsa garden. The goal is to learn how to grow vegetables to then eating what we have grown. We have a diverse population and salsa brings every ethnic group together. We want to grow a garden and reap the rewards. We want to eat our produce. We will make the most by allowing all students to participate in the garden.

In this type of learning environment there are 4 teachers, each with a homebase of about 20 students, as well as an English Language teacher for our large group of English Language Learners. The Studio has only partial walls and a variety of large and small group spaces filled with easily movable furniture--couches, stools, and tables, but no traditional desks--to allow for flexible learning and space for students to learn in the way that works best for them. We are all one 'class,' and teachers share students, and students share teachers interchangeably. Our goal is success for each student. We understand that success looks different for each student, so we focus on personalized learning. Personalized learning lets each student work at their own pace and at their own level. We also focus on preparing students for the 21st century and the future by allowing for extensive opportunities with Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math. The Studio and our STEAM focus allows for more small group and individualized time for students, which benefits everyone. Setting up for a new school year comes with lots of organization and decorating. Throughout the year all this work can be quickly worn down by use- which is exactly what we want! To make the materials last so that students can continue to use them it helps to laminate paper items. With a laminator our supplies will last longer and get used more often! Our Studio also needs anchor charts and other documentation of learning. Post it chart paper is the most convenient way to do this and is a student and teacher favorite!

My students come to school every day eager to learn and put their trust in me. Every student has a unique learning ability, and I want to give each individual the best learning experience by adapting my lessons to meet their individual needs. Incorporating engaging resources and hands-on manipulatives allow my students to work through self-discovery, ultimately leading to abstract reasoning.

Using dry erase boards throughout the day will help ensure that students are on-task and being given multiple opportunities to respond during the learning process. My students can take charge of their learning by immediately seeing if their action met the target and make corrections on their next turn. I can immediately see from their responses the direction my lesson needs to take. I can also see how the student is thinking so I can avoid misconceptions. Even though my students come from a variety of backgrounds, one thing my students all have in common is the need to express themselves, and dry erase boards will help them do so!

The majority of their life experiences come from inside their home and their surrounding community. They do not realize how large and exciting the world is or the possibilities that it offers. I want to bring the real world to my students and make learning come alive by taking them places beyond the classroom and providing experiences not found in our school or textbooks. All students love to get out of the classroom and go on field trips, but they are usually limited to one or two per year. Owl Cardboard Virtual Reality kits will allow my students to go on a multitude of field trips throughout the year without leaving the classroom. We will be bringing the real world to our room. Students can hear from Holocaust survivors at Auschwitz, tour William Shakespeare's school in his home of Stratford-Upon-Avon, explore multiple STEM careers, or connect to real world issues such as the sustainability and technology behind soil science in farming.

The state is constantly saying that we need to improve the reading scores and overall ability of the inner city school students. I am 100% all for that, but to do that we need materials to make that happen. There is a reason that I have 4th graders starting the school year on a 2nd grade reading level. It isn't the teachers shortcomings, but that is what the state says. Little do they know that perhaps that student grew two whole grades last year! That takes patience and dedication from both teacher and student. For students to grow, it is absolutely imperative to have the necessary materials for that to happen. Students are more willing to read a book if they have books of their interest, have a comfortable area with pillows or beanbags to lay, and/or an organized book shelf area to choose their books from. With the help and generosity of other, I am hoping that can happen! Thank you!I know most believe that students will pick up a book at school and read if told or by choice. That is not the case in most circumstances. Research has shown that if students are given books that peak their interest and given a place they feel they can 'escape' to read, they are more likely to enjoy and comprehend what they are reading. Kids that don't have much at home, are going to be thrilled to be able to read in a library corner that they can feel at home in! Inner city students deserve an area where they can read, relax and enjoy a good book.

The area in which these children live is now a disaster zone. Many have lost their homes, as well as clothes, toys, and other belongings. In the heart of the devastation, most of these students have lost their homes, and now, their school. School supplies and materials should be the least of their worries in a time like this. The binders, pencils, writing easel, etc. are all things that were lost in the flood. The new items will provide a sense of normalcy for my students who are returning to school after losing their homes in The Great Flood of 2016. After losing so much, these students deserve a well stocked, normal classroom. With your help, this can be done. The students will have the resources they need to continue their education. I will have the resources to implement a rigorous instruction and reach every child on his or her level. The writing easel will be used for small group instruction. The binders will be distributed to each child so they will have a place to house all of their curriculum resources. The pencils and scissors will also be distributed among the students. These supplies will offer more than material comfort to a community trying to rebuild.","My students need binders, pencils, writing easel, etc. to replenish all of their supplies that were lost in the flood.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Supplies,1317.36,Fully Funded

Our school and community was affected by the 'Great Flood of 2016'. My students nad I have lost all our supplies in the flood. Many students have lost their homes, clothes, and toys. I had three feet of water in my classroom. With the humidity in south Louisiana mold grows very quickly and everything was destroyed either by water or mold. We are currently a displaced school. We have been relocated and merged with another nearby school. After 26 years of teaching I am starting over with nothing. My students had just brought all their supplies to school. We had four days of school before the flood struck us. We lost our school in the recent flood and 50% of my students homes were inundated by flood waters. Our lives have been changed forever. I have included both teacher and student supplies in my request. Funding this project will help my students receive the quality education they deserve in this most difficult situation. The carpet and easel brings us together for times of sharing experiences and allows my first graders to focus on instruction better than sitting at desk. The leveled books are used for small group instruction, allowing me to meet the needs of various learners. During that time the students use reading phones so they can hear themselves and practice reading at their reading rate. The journals allow the students to express themselves through writing and illustrations. We will use the dry erase boards to practice spelling and make associations between sounds and similar words.

They all come to school ready to learn, no matter the challenges they face at home. They are a diverse group of students from low-income backgrounds who speak multiple languages, play sports, have different interests and talents. They have been together as a group since Kindergarten and they treat one another like family because of this. They demonstrate respect for one another and they teach each other something about respect each and every day. These materials will be used to teach students strategies needed to increase their comprehension when reading fiction and non-fiction texts. Students in my building love to read! The problem they face when they are reading is that they lack remembering what they have read. This can make reading frustrating for my students, especially when we have book discussions after our reading time, and they can't remember anything to share. These materials will make learning reading comprehension strategies fun and exciting for students. After teaching students the reading strategies they need to increase comprehension, they will be able to use these materials practice the strategies in a fun and engaging way. Every day we have a 30-minute block built in our schedule for practicing reading skills. The literacy game library will be used during this block. Students will be broken into various groups. I will be working with a group and the other groups will be practicing the skills I have taught them with these games. The close discussion clips will be used during book clubs to facilitate book group discussions and increase academic language being used. Last but not least, the read and respond evidence cards will be used during morning meeting to quickly practice comprehension strategies as a whole group every day.","My students need the reading and writing skills game library, read and respond evidence cards, and last but not least closed reading response clips.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Books,249.01,Fully Funded

Our high school classroom consists of students who have not been successful in a traditional setting, some of them are behind on credits, many of their families are economically disadvantaged, and most of our students are African-Americans. We focus on preparing students to focus on the future, whether that is college, the workforce, or parenting. Over 60% of our students are male and all of our students are talented, independent individuals who want to succeed. If you look at the canon of literature taught in many high school classrooms, it doesn't exactly represent a young, African-American man who grew up in an urban metropolis. Many studies have shown that we're more likely to be engaged in literature if the characters look, sound, and have similar experiences to our own. We need books that represent our students and tell their stories, so they can create their own narrative. 'Yummy: The Last Days of a Southside Shorty' does that and it has won the Corretta Scott King Book Award. By capturing students' attention we can promote engagement the rest of the year.

This student leadership team worked with our outstanding school's digital arts community to assess what technology would be most advantageous for their fellow students and our school's neighboring Keck School of Medicine of USC community. They focused on supporting their fellow students' desire to express themselves in our new 21st century digital environment from a variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds, focusing on creative writing, digital animation design skills, and teamwork. When my students apply for summer internships at organizations and community businesses, they will impress the interviewers when they outline their skills at using Adobe Creative Suite 6 programs such as: After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator, which require a computer memory, headphones and lighting to create at the professional level necessary nowadays to design and create digital artistic projects. Having a fast computer that transfers and manipulates data quickly both within and outside its case will help students build teamwork through real-world digital design and project problem solving. Students will grow socially through the focused teamwork this technology will support. We are students in Mr. P’s Cartoon Animation class, who aspire to use the skills we will learn during the school year to better ourselves and our communities. Our school derives from a multitude of backgrounds, with a goal to provide a promising future for the community. Better computer memory, lighting and a headphone will benefit those who lack a computer at home, increasing the rendering for videos, projects, and photos, which are essential in defining our community. We believe by enhancing our computers, our community and institution will grow stronger. The upgraded technology will immaculately provide us with leadership skills by giving us the opportunities to cooperate with other groups within our community. This advanced technology will give us the chance to collaborate with school clubs by being able to process digital film and art quicker and more efficiently. Overall, the new technology will provide us with many more opportunities. We consider being given the opportunity to be granted this reward will not only enhance our appreciation for visual arts but also innovate our approaches for collaborating on classroom projects with our classmates, bringing greater quality to them.

My students enter my classroom every day full of questions, hugs, stories, and laughter. They are a resilient, hopeful, joyous bunch and I truly believe that they deserve the world. The past two weeks have been an incredible hardship for many communities in southern Louisiana. The Great Flood of 2016 impacted many cities, parishes, homes, businesses, and schools. Unfortunately, our small town was affected by this flooding, and our beautiful school has taken on water. Many of my students' worlds have been turned upside down. They have lost their homes, their clothes, their possessions, and now their school. Our school has been blessed with the opportunity to lease classrooms in a former community college until we can safely return to our school.

They even ate some of the vegetables, such as radishes and greens, we grew. Now that the new school year has begun, I have spoken with my new pre-k students, my former students now in kindergarten, and last year's 4th graders that are now in 5th grade about their experiences and what would inspire them to be life-long gardeners. They want to expand this excellent learning experience by installing more raised beds, filling them with soil, and planting fall and spring vegetable seeds. My older students recommended expanding our garden book collection to encourage literacy and inspire them to be stewards of the environment. Years ago, my pre-k students (now 5th graders) completed a worm farm project, including a PowerPoint that explained how to create the worm farm. They also were able to measure how much worm castings were created each week. These memories inspired them to add a worm composting system to our gardens in order to recycle kitchen scraps. They want to see first hand how worms improve the soil by eating what we throw away. The children want to have an opportunity to see where their food comes from and to gain a fuller understanding of the seed cycle. In addition, they look forward to spending time outdoors getting exercise and fresh air. They are excited at the prospect of being able to taste vegetables they have grown themselves.

Our school is grades 4k through 8th grade in a very small and rural community. 100% of our students receive free breakfast and lunch. And we are a Title One school. Just this past spring, the largest employing industry in the town closed causing a huge loss of employment for our students' families. Many times our students are not able to participate or be offered the same opportunities as their peers in our district because of their low socio-economic background. However, our students and their families did not lose hope and stood behind our band program. We opened the program up to grades 5th through 8th and had almost 100% show interest in participating. However, many had to be turned away because they were unable to rent instruments. The majority of our parents were willing and excited to have their child learn an instrument, but were unable to afford the cost to rent or purchase an instrument. The bell kits will be given to students interested in playing percussion, but that would be unable to participate in band because of their inability to afford the rental fee. Our students have loved the two Pbones we received from DonorsChoose last year and we have one student that is still in need of a Pbone. The reeds are a necessary accessory for our clarinet and saxophone players and need to be replenished each year, especially as our numbers continue to grow. Our band program will continue to grow in numbers and spirit as more and more children are able to participate without the worry of monetary obligations. No student should ever be turned away from the opportunity of learning and participating in the worldwide language of music. Our students deserve to have the same opportunities as all of their peers. And this will allow our school to begin sending students to the high school ready to participate in their band program.",My students need instruments and the corresponding accessories to participate in our new and growing band program.,Music & The Arts,Grades 6-8,Supplies,815.62,Fully Funded

I have students struggling with various things from ADHD to the side effects of shaken baby syndrome. My students come from low income families, and do not have the resources outside of school to help with their focus. Every day they come in to school, sit on hard chairs, and have to focus on situations that any person would find difficult. They struggle to sit still, causing them to be unable to focus, and distracting the other students in the room. Every child in my room has the desire to learn. Now I want to give them the resources they need to be able to learn. My students have different factors that make it difficult for them to remain seated; from ADHD to the effects of shaken baby syndrome. They want to be up and moving around, but when they are they can't focus, and they distract other students in the class as well. By using stability balls, students would be able to wiggle and move freely, within the realistic restrictions of their desk space. This will allow the students to be able to move, wiggle, and get their excess energy out, but also be able to focus at the same time, without having to get up and wander around the classroom.

ef8eca412acb9baeb7de1b7e602e62e7,Student Headphones to Listen and Record on iPads!,"Kindergarten is my favorite grade to teach because it's a year full of so much growth. My students typically come into my classroom with no previous school experience and little to no academic background. By the end of the year, we expect students to be able to read, write, and do math on their own. My students are the reason I love my job. I thrive working in a low income, urban setting with students who can make so much growth throughout the school year. Even though some of my students may come from rough settings where things are difficult at home, I strive to provide a safe and loving learning environment for them while they are in my care. In my classroom, I educate my students knowing that they can all succeed and feel success each and every school day. If my students go home feeling happy, loved, listened to, and educated, then I have done my job for that day. Recently, our district began the rollout of individual iPads for every student. This is a very exciting adventure with 26 kindergartners and we spent last year learning with different apps and working on incorporating them into our daily activities. The students loved being able to create something and then record their voice telling about what they created. However, the students were only able to use the microphone on the iPads to record and it ended up being very loud in the background and hard to hear. I also went through numerous pairs of cheap headphones that I purchased just to make it through the year. The headphones that I'm hoping to get are designed for children, so they are durable, have volume control, and have a microphone for recording. These headphones will make it safe for my students to listen to stories and/or videos and also make it easier to record a story to go along with a creation.","My students need headphones that are durable, created safe for children with volume control, and have microphones so that students can record their own stories to go along with their creations.","Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Technology,494.55,Fully Funded

My students not only learn from me but they learn from each other and themselves. My students are curious and eager to learn! With team work and perseverance they can accomplish anything they set their minds to in my class! Personal dry erase boards will be beneficial to my classroom and students in many ways. First off, having students use dry erase boards for doing work will minimize the amount of paper being used in the classroom. Students will use the boards at their seats and on the rug and will use them for many different purposes. These purposes include: math problems, making tables to help with math, instead of scrap paper during tests, practicing drawing shapes, practicing spelling words, writing sentences, and more. It will also help me as an educator to do informal assessments quickly and efficiently by asking students to write an answer on a board and then quickly showing me. The map will be used for geography purposes. Students throughout the year will be researching where their family originated from; this is important especially for my class because they are so diverse. This map will show students which part of the world they are from. Students will also refer to the map to look for any place if it is brought up in a book or if the student is simply curious.

We are a Title I school with 100% participation in the reduced price/free lunch program. Many of our students have never left the community nor experienced anything outside of the area. All of our students are eager to learn and need experiences that they do not get at home. We do not have much parental involvement at our school and we are looking to change that. We want parents to associate school with love, learning and caring. We would like to change parents' points-of-view from the negative experiences they may have had as a child, to be able to see the positive experiences we provide their children.

When reading is nurtured soon after birth, literacy develops naturally and children can become readers almost miraculously. 'Children are made readers on the laps of their parents.' ~ Emilie Buchwald My school educates a diverse population of approximately 350 students in grades PreK - 4. My school is a nurturing community of dedicated teachers led by a principal committed to literacy and promoting joyful reading experiences. I am a Reading Specialist and work as a Basic Skills Teacher for students that are identified as at-risk or experiencing reading difficulties. My students are eager and enthusiastic. They are hard-working and resilient. The older students are, the more difficult it is to remediate reading difficulties. We work to provide targeted intervention as early as possible. Often my learners come to school in Kindergarten without the necessary literacy experiences. Many families are not aware that the critical time for brain development is birth - age 4 and that the #1 best thing that they can do to support their children's learning is to read to and talk with them at home. This project will make an investment in our future population by supporting our families as soon as their children are welcomed into the world. Many families do not have books at home. I would like to encourage reading at home for our future students. I can do this by supporting the families that have children already enrolled in my school. Creating 'Welcome to Literacy' baskets is my vision for getting this message out to families early. Whenever a student currently enrolled in my school welcomes a sibling to the family, they will be provided with a welcome basket of reading goodies ~ board books, developmental stacking blocks, a baby product, and literature modeling the importance of reading and talking to babies beginning at birth! Research supports the dynamic impact that reading to children can make on literacy development.

They learn and process information differently from their peers. One thing all of my students have in common is their love for music. This is another great way for us to connect with the students and for the students to connect with each other! The opportunity for my students to work with a certified music therapist would allow them another way to get engaged, participate and express themselves. Music is a world within itself, with a language we all understand -Stevie Wonder. Students in my class range from three to five years old. They have delays in 2 or more areas (cognition, motor, communication, social/emotional, and or functional/adaptive) of their development; however, they are still unique and fabulous scholars! They are loving, caring, energetic, and want to learn! With the help of music therapy many of these students are given another opportunity to learn. While we use music in the classroom, the money from this project will give the students an opportunity to work with teaching artists that are also board certified music therapists and have experience working with children with special needs. Donations to this project will help fund Learning Through Music groups for 15 weeks in our classroom. During Learning Through Music, students will learn academic and arts concepts that are embedded into the music activities (instrument play, singing, finger plays, sensory/relaxation, and movement). The students will also have the opportunity to transfer skills practiced and learned during music group to the classroom as the teacher and special education aides will also participate in the learning. In terms of brain development, musical performance is every bit as important educationally as reading and writing --Oliver Sacks.

As a working mom with two children of my own, I often lament my family's loss of reading time to the demands of just making it through the day. Reading, in my opinion, is mistakenly considered a solitary activity. You may take the words in through your own eyes, but I believe so much is lost if you don't share everything that happens after that--the joy, surprise, confusion, frustration and reward of reading good books. I want to create these opportunities in school, for this is what creates lifelong readers. If my project is funded, my students will participate in a genre study of historical fiction. Students will be able to chose an historical novel that interests them and read in small groups of 3-4, while together we will use our selections to examine the genre and its traits. It is important that students are exposed to and immersed in many kinds of print and many types of literature. A genre study is one way to accomplish that. I chose the genre of historical fiction as one way to support history standards. Our past is too vast and complicated to be covered in one history class per year; reading historical fiction not only brings the past to life, but it also exposes children to parts of history that may not be covered adequately in their course of social studies. Additionally, my students will read primary sources and informational texts associated with the time-preiod of their chosen novel, which adds another element of genre exposure (fiction v. non-fiction). Ultimately, a genre study will allow us to not only enjoy historical content, but also to 'compare and contrast a fictional portrayal of a time, place, or character and a historical account of the same period as a means of understanding how authors of fiction use or alter history.'

Private music lessons are very expensive and out of reach for most of our students. The student body is made of mostly minorities. I want to ensure that our students here are receiving just as many opportunities as those who can afford private lessons and go to a school with more money/supplies. Ukuleles will serve to help students learn an instrument closely related to the guitar but that is small enough for all hand sizes. We received a new curriculum for grades K-5 but nothing for 6th grade. The one thing I did find in my new curriculum was a special Ukulele Project. This project will help to capture 6th graders attention and will serve to improve music literacy. Ukuleles are also similar to guitars but much smaller fitting everyone's hands.

My classroom is a mixture of students familiar with U.S. American culture and education and those brand new to the country with varying degrees of formal education. I have students who come to the United States from Asia, Africa and South America, and speak many languages including Karen, Hmong, Somali, and Spanish. Our school population is 80% ELL and 90% free lunch. My students bring a resilient spirit and a growth mindset for learning. All students, at every level of English proficiency, are engaged in deep learning conversations and rigorous activities. It is important to understand that the majority of my students come from collectivist cultures where learning is best done through oral tradition, music, and cooperative activities. The Boomwhacker project would be a way to teach my class how to read and produce music in a cost effective way. We have not had music education for two years due to budget cuts. Over a decade of research has proven that music education is critical to a child's brain development. 'Music, as we know, is one of the most powerful means available to further human development and build great communities and societies. Neuroscience research also now shows us that music education is a very powerful tool for attaining a child's full intellectual, social and creative potential,' said Dr. Peter Simon, President and CEO, The Royal Conservatory of Music.' (The Benefits of Music Education: An Overview of Current Neuroscience Research. May 7, 2014) The Boomwhacker Project would tap into my students' cultural traditions of music and dance, giving them the ability to express themselves authentically, and it would open the door to future music programs in middle and high school. Music is every child's right. Its benefits on brain development, creativity, critical thinking and health are proven. My students do not get formal music education and the opportunities afforded to some for private music lessons. This project would serve to create a more equitable situation that would allow my children the same benefits as those who get formal music education. Because I have music training, I would be able to teach my students how to read and play music with the Boomwhackers. My goal is to provide music education two days a week and private lessons for those who would like more time. This training would also be preparation for performance opportunities that we have school-wide a few times a year. Thank you for considering my project.

No matter the goal of the students, every single child is putting in effort to understand and grasp the content being delivered to them. Many students are nervous to begin their journey of the chemistry curriculum, but together they leave inspired and fascinated. The chemistry classroom is where the students are able to see details of what is happening in and around them. We do several labs and hands on activities where the students faces just light up with energy and fascination. The students are putting work in daily to understand all the different concepts being taught to them. My school and classroom was one of the areas most affected by the flood on August 13th. My classroom alone had over 4 feet of water and destroyed nearly everything including the newly bought school supplies my students purchased. The items needed are everyday classroom items that were once taken for granted but are now desperately needed. Nothing was able to be salvaged from my classroom. The items I have requested are things that are vital to the recovery of my once lively and joyful classroom. Some items include dry erase markers to write on the mini whiteboards that the students love to use for quick practice or the simple supplies such as loose-leaf paper and pens. I also ask for art supplies for my students to use to brighten up their assignments. My students have the option to use tickets to use the coveted classroom microwave or store their lunch in the mini fridge, which was damaged in the flood. Other items such as the drawer organizer will bring normalcy to the classroom as the students store their completed assignments and classroom packets in this area. All these things, both big and small will not only help my students return to normality, after the flood, but for them to learn and love the world around them through chemistry. ","My students need everything possible to make a normal classroom work.

Despite the many challenges they face, I am looking to keep things simple and provide my students with creative and meaningful learning experiences. They like to move, they love to read, and love lots of positive attention. Many of them are being raised in single parent households and receive a free lunch based on their socioeconomic status. These things may prevent them from getting ahead early in life and may not provide them with the life experiences many of us see as 'typical'. From the minute they walk in the door of my classroom I focus on their potential and growth while they are with me. I may not be able to control their home lives, however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day. By doing this in a creative and positive way, I am hopeful to inspire even our earliest learners to continue on a path of academic excellence. Moving from kindergarten to 4th grade has been somewhat difficult. These Science File Folder Games, colored paper, CD/cassette player, and headphones splitter will enable me to spend more time on writing instruction, give my students science centers to help integrate it into our literacy block, and allow my students to listen to books on tape/CD that I already own. By adding these additional supports, my goal is that their test scores will increase significantly because of the materials that they will now have available to them. These supplies will enable my students to have enjoyable and educational centers that they will learn and grow from, from now until the end of the year.","My students need center materials to use during our 60 minute intervention block such as Science File Folder Games, colored paper, a CD/cassette boombox, and headphones splitter.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Supplies,163.42,Fully Funded

My students and I are displaced at another school right now borrowing an empty PE room with limited to no teacher supplies/furniture available.

Due to this, most students refrain from wearing the so-called 'smocks' at all costs, causing them to get paint on their clothes, oops! My students also love to draw, and they are constantly trying to learn how to draw new things. Some love to draw animals, some like cars, and others like cartoon characters.

We've discussed how different seating options will allow them to move while doing their work. These materials will allow movement while they work to keep them active and engaged. They have discussed and voted on what seating options they want to have first. Having a variety of seating options will allow each student to take responsibility in their choices of work space.

Almost 20 years ago, I became one of the luckiest people on Earth when I began my teaching career as an English Language (EL) teacher at a school in St. Paul, Minnesota. This school is not only unique in my district, but it is unique in the nation as it serves an all-immigrant and refugee population of learners ages 14-20. They come from over 30 different countries, and they represent different religions, races, cultures, and experiences. They are truly heroes in my eyes, as they have lived lives most of us could never imagine. They have come to America for one reason or another, but most often it is for reasons of war, displacement, gang warfare, poverty, lack of opportunities in education, no freedom, and they seek asylum, refuge, a sanctuary. They ask for little but give so much. What these students bring with them are their gifts that I always strive to recognize, validate, and celebrate. We create a community in our classroom and each member plays a valuable role, each distinct yet united. They complete me. As a creative/academic writing teacher in a high school of all English learners (ELs), I want a classroom that allows for as much inspiration, creativity, and focus as possible. Table and seating arrangements that allow for flexibility and flow support collaboration in many forms. Students will be able to work in multiple group patterns, individually, and as a whole group with the plan I have proposed. Introducing the balance bar chairs gives some learners the options for kinesthetics while learning to stay focused on writing, while spending energy.

d47b46c49c9ec09daee6b978e1307b58,Supplies for Stellar Students with ASD,"I teach in a high-need, special service school district in New York City. Our 3rd grade class has six amazing students with autism. These children have many challenges ranging from their disability and the economic challenges in their community. Let's give them everything they need to find success in this world. These children learn best when they are provided with multiple sensory enrichment. They love to dance, sing, and play while learning. Teaching a class with autism is challenging and fun. What helps my students learn best are hands-on materials and engaging activities. My focus in the classroom is taking student strengths and expanding on them to help them achieve goals. My students thrive from individual attention and positive praise. My students have many sensory needs everyday. Without an outlet for sensory stimulation they become restless and distracted. Learning is difficult and stress related behaviors begin to occur. This supply list will address the many sensory needs of my students with autism in different ways across the entire school day. Fidget toys will help students remain calm and focused during class time and transitions. Counting, sorting, spelling manipulatives will create a sense of play and engagement to make learning achievable, meaningful and fun for all my students. Dry erase boards will help to make writing more sensory based. They will also make mistakes easy to correct, creating a sense of encouragement and achievement. The classroom rug will assist in creating a reading space for other positions than just sitting in chair. In addition, it will serve as a great place to practice social sharing skills. Trays will help my students keep track of supplies, return supplies independently. Overall, these supplies would help my class become more engaged in the learning process and increase student achievements throughout the school year. Learning should be painless and fun!","My students need fidget toys to keep them calm during school, counting tools to increase number awareness, letter tiles to promote spelling and reading skills and dry erase boards to create engagement for writing.","Math & Science, Special Needs",Grades 3-5,Supplies,319.08,Fully Funded

Reading and talking about science with a friend helps them grow as readers and helps build their interest and knowledge of the world around them. Our school is an urban elementary school in St. Paul. We are a neighborhood school. We have two first grade Language Academy classrooms serving mainstream students as well as many bilingual students who are learning English. Some of our students have recently arrived in the United States and did not have an opportunity to attend school before. They come to school excited to learn. Every day I see first graders working together, playing together, and engaged in learning about math, reading, writing, and science. They are a community of learners that cares about each other. First graders love Partner Reading. With a buzz of excitement, pairs of students select a set of books from our reading cart, which is shared between two classrooms. Having chosen their books, they sit down together and share the books. There will be two copies of each book, so that each child has one in hand. They practice listening to each other read and matching their voice to read at the same pace. They work together to figure out difficult words by looking closely at the word and at the pictures, and thinking about the story. First graders are especially interested in science and in learning about the world around them. They are asking for sets of non-fiction science books for Partner Reading because they love to read about science and talk about the amazing facts they learn. After reading a science book together, the students will help each other retell the important facts they learned and ask each other questions about the book. Our first grade English Language Learners need many different opportunities to read and work together. Partner Reading will help them become better readers. The students will help each other understand challenging science concepts in the books they read. Reading together will help them develop social skills as they learn to work together and listen to each other in a conversation. Talking together will strengthen their oral language skills and vocabulary. Students will be excited to read because reading about science together is fun. They will want to read and learn more.

I am continually surprised at the reaction the students have when they receive the smallest of treats. Our school does not have some of the frills of more fortunate areas, but we find creative ways to provide an exciting environment for the children. We have awesome facilities in our Chem lab, but the one thing that we are short on is storage space. We have text books and supplies in every nook and cranny of our room. It would be nice if we could properly store our stuff in an more organized fashion utilizing a couple of book cases.

While a portion of our students are brand new to the country, others have been in Saint Paul, and even our school, for generations. Our diverse fifth grade classroom includes 25 students, speaking 9 languages in addition to English. Most receive free or reduced lunch. Because of such a diverse group, teachers work hard to meet the needs of individual learners. While some need 'gaps filled' because they may be in school for the first time (yes- in 5th grade), others need enrichment and challenge in order to stay engaged. The magic happens when students work together. They have as much to learn from each other as from me. The fifth grade is in need of funding for transportation to and from Camp St. Croix. This project would help cover a portion of the cost for bus transportation for 80 students and adults. Another teacher has submitted a proposal for another portion of the transportation cost. Last year, when our students were in 4th grade, they were able to attend a one day field trip at Camp St. Croix to help build community and teamwork within their classrooms. As an extension to last year’s field trip, the fifth grade will be going back to Camp St. Croix for an overnight stay. This is the first year our students will be attending an overnight field trip to Camp St. Croix and, for most, will be the first time away from their families overnight. Camp St. Croix would truly be a once in a lifetime experience as many of our students would not be able to provide the funds given their financial status. Throughout the trip, students will learn about the diverse wildlife and ecosystems at Camp St. Croix. They will participate in hands-on nature lessons and will be engaged in activities to strengthen teamwork in small and large groups. The field trip will also integrate part of the 5th grade science state standards as the students will also be learning about erosion and renewable and non-renewable energy found in Minnesota. The educational benefits of this experience are endless. Research shows that sound field trip experience have a highly positive impact on students' science learning. Camp St. Croix would be a lifelong memory for our students as well as open students' eyes both to possibilities in environmental science and their influence on the environment.

Most students do not have access to a variety of instruments at home, but they love making music in the classroom. They are eager to learn every day. They ask thoughtful questions and work together to synergize and make great music! Our classroom currently has a couple very old borrowed music stands. We are looking to gain our own class set of music stands so many students can perform instrumental music at the same time. When music is practiced and performed students discover how learning to play music can be the perfect vehicle for teaching team building, respect, focusing, listening, problem solving, and other important life skills.

I need more books at different levels to continue to hook kids on reading. The more you read, the better reader you become. I need to order leveled books that match my students' independent reading levels. My goal is to improve their reading achievement by increasing the amount of time they read at their independent reading level. Research tells us reading and rereading is recommended for increasing fluency, which also contributes to improved comprehension. There is a direct correlation between the amount of time spent reading and the level of reading achievement students reach. Thus, independent reading needs to occur everyday. You will make it possible for the students to be able to read a variety of books each day at their just right level.

In my class I have students who are new to the United States and are learning to speak English as well as learning to read in English. They need interesting books at an early reading level to take home to read with their families. The books in the Red Rocket Reader series provides beginning readers just what they need to be successful: a simple, repetitive text with beautiful pictures that match the words. The books they are asking for are about animals on a farm, funny monkeys, children visiting grandparents, children playing outdoors, and other familiar topics. This supports the comprehension of early readers. While learning to read even the most beginning books, my students need to be able to talk about the story and retell it. Students will learn to think about what the story is about (characters, setting, and events) and about what happens in the story and why. When students take the books home parents will be empowered to help students retell the story. Parents will know how to talk purposefully with their child about the books. Your support of this project will help our first graders to become readers and thinkers, and help our families to become involved in and support their students' learning to read.

Students will use leveled books during reading time to practice reading independently, with a partner, or in small groups. From the first day of school on, my Kindergarteners read common sight words and use reading strategies to help them secure word knowledge and reading skills. I want to spend time with my students connecting these practices to their reading. In addition, having access to more books means added exposure to different publishing styles- especially fonts, pictures, and genres- which will allow students to transition from one type of book to another with ease.

I want them to continue their artistic dreams. Who knows, maybe I have the next Picasso in my class. My students use colored pencils during math, ELA, scicence and social studies. They are constantly graphing, filling in charts, or checking their rubrics. Needless to say, we go through a lot of colored pencils. I find that when they use markers, they tend to bleed through their papers. I don't want to have their work ruined. My budding little artists are in need of some supplies. They will be able to use these colored pencils almost on a daily basis. The sharpener is also a great tool because they need it to continue their work. Wherever there is a pencil, there will always be a pencil sharpener. The paper is for their recess time. That's when they really let their imagination go wild.

At a young age it is so very important to children to love learning or in this case love reading. I would love to be able to create that space for them here.

The person that reaches the goal gets the large cupcake and everyone else gets a mini cupcake. I looped with my class this year and a lot of my books the students have already read. This has meant that our goal is a little stagnate. I need new books that will make the students reach up in the air like Oliver Twist and plead, 'Please, [Madam], I want some more.'

In a nutshell, Expeditionary Learning provides students with an interdisciplinary education connected to character and community. An integral component of a student’s education at our school is through “Learning Expeditions”, in-depth studies of a compelling topic tied to literacy standards. These Learning Expeditions go hand in hand with field work experiences within our local community to further investigate and explore real world connections. We think our third grade students are extraordinary minds working to solve these real world problems. With 87% minority students, 68% of the students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch, new immigrants from Mexico, Syrian refugees, students in transitional housing, and a multitude of languages spoken, our students bring their insight and diverse background experiences to the problem solving table. We believe that these students are changing the world. Our dream is for our entire third grade to attend an overnight three-day program at the Keystone Science School in the mountains of Colorado. This project will cover a portion of the cost of this field trip. This Spring, our third grade students will be engaging in a three-month long learning expedition to explore our urban watershed and nearby creek’s water quality, and come up with a plan to take action in our community to improve the quality of the Creek that runs along the back of our school. Our creek is part of a larger watershed, one that begins in the mountains and ends in the Gulf of Mexico. By engaging in the learning at the source of our watershed, students will gain the knowledge to understand water on a global scale. Our dream is to have our students work alongside scientists at Keystone Science School to learn the necessary background knowledge and skills to tackle water issues. This three-day experience at Keystone Science School is pivotal to shaping our students into scientists. We will take this content back to the classroom and our nearby creek, making connections between the world around us and our community. Most of our students have never been to the mountains, despite the close proximity. This fieldwork experience will broaden their horizons as scientists and world changers.

Physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited. My students learn best through singing, movement, speech, creating and performing on instruments so increasing the amount of instruments will increase student learning and understanding.I teach 600 students in grades K-5, and they come to me for 45 minutes once a week. My school is a Title I school in a military town. Military families many times will move away due to orders or deployments, but often return 1 to 3 years later. Students at my school are eager to learn and are most excited about performing on instruments and creating and performing their own compositions.I am certified in the Orff approach and use this approach daily as a way for my students to learn. Students learn through exploration and creating. With another soprano glockenspiel, students will be able to improvise melodies (create on the spot), compose melodies, and accompany other students who are singing, moving, speaking or performing on other instruments. The music used in the Orff process is based on folk songs to which students have connections. They will be able to connect with students who are not from America (we have students from Yemen, China, Mexico, Columbia etc), places families have been deployed (Japan, Germany, Africa etc), and, of course, American folk music!While 1 more instrument may seem insignificant, having 1 more Orff instrument (glockenspiel) will allow more students to participate in an activity.

Water is something many people take for granted in day to day life. However at our school, water is a common complaint amongst our students. Many of our students opt to not drink any water during the day rather than drink the warm tinted water that comes from our water fountains. The students at our school come from low-income homes making it hard to fund projects like this even though new water fountains would greatly help all of the students and staff in our school. The students have classes such as Physical Education that involve physical activity and staying hydrated is important. The students at our school spend all day working to ensure that they pass their classes and have a future, yet they are unable to have access to clean none the less cold water. Hydration is essential to life. Sadly, our students don't take the time or have the desire to properly hydrate themselves during school. The reason is simple. Bad water. The students hate drinking the dirty, warm water that our school water fountains provide. The students will have a better understanding of how important water is to their learning and health if they had cold, clean, filtered water at their disposal on a daily basis. The water bottle filler fountains also provide a green, waste free option which will help the environment in which the students live. Understanding how important it is to drink clean water and how important it is to save water, will give our students a better understanding of how they can help others who are in need of clean water and ways they can conserve and waste less. We are trying to get three cold filtered water bottle stations (one on each floor of our school) installed at our school. As members of the School Wellness Council our responsibility is to find ways to make our school and community healthier. Drinking clean, filtered, cold water throughout the school day is one way we want to help our community and school. Plus the water stations are waste free and thus saves our environment in the process. We are planning on selling water bottles for the Parent Teacher Student Association that will help raise funds for the PTSA. We will be responsible for collecting the money and promoting the use of the water bottles in the new water stations. We will also be educating our peers in the importance of staying hydrated throughout the school day. This information will be created and given during a school wide event by us students in the School Wellness Council. We believe that since our peers don't drink the school's water they instead are either drinking the 'sugar' free sodas provided in our school's vending machines or they are drinking nothing at all during the entire school day. We believe that providing water bottle stations that produce clean, filtered, cold water will increase the amount of water our peers will drink. This will keep them healthier and also provides them with a FREE drink option that is better and healthier than what the vending machines provide.

My classroom hosts a games club to get students to interact and participate after school in a safe, fun way that allows them to make friends and gives them a place to spend quality time after school. Their interactions allow them to work on problem solving skills and peer relationships. I have purchased games and my colleagues and friends have donated games but many are in less than good shape. Also, I can always use more games so kids are not waiting for games to play and losing interest in being here. I have students currently come after school to play games as a way to provide a safe and educational experience. Many students go home to empty houses or rarely get to experience the fun of working with peers on a game or puzzle and lose the social skills involved with such activities. Giving kids a place to fit in and have fun with peers is important in helping them shape and develop social skills, as well as provide a safe place to do such things.

Maria Montessori said, “Scientific observation then has established that education is not what the teacher gives; education is a natural process spontaneously carried out by the human individual, and is acquired not by listening to words but by experiences upon the environment.” Our philosophy of education strives to embody this principle, providing our students the opportunity to drive their own learning and explore the world around them.

This process forces them to work 'backwards' to develop their image. It is very challenging and I have witnessed first hand the light bulb moment when they truly understand the process. You see a flash in their eye with an almost immediate, 'I get it now!' response. Your help will ensure that these students get what they need to become better artists and become more well-rounded. These materials and projects are experiences that these students will remember for the rest of their lives. Most (if not all) students will have never used brayers, gelli plates, or scratch foam to create these unique pieces of art. These unique materials open up a whole new world of art to students. Please help us to make this a reality for my students and me.

Almost 20 years ago, I became one of the luckiest people on Earth when I began my teaching career as an English Language (EL) teacher at a school in St. Paul, Minnesota. This school is not only unique in my district, but it is unique in the nation as it serves an all-immigrant and refugee population of learners ages 14-20. They come from over 30 different countries, and they represent different religions, races, cultures, and experiences. They are truly heroes in my eyes, as they have lived lives most of us could never imagine. They have come to America for one reason or another, but most often it is for reasons of war, displacement, gang warfare, poverty, lack of opportunities in education, no freedom, and they seek asylum, refuge, a sanctuary. They ask for little but give so much. What these students bring with them are their gifts that I always strive to recognize, validate, and celebrate. We create a community in our classroom and each member plays a valuable role, each distinct yet united. They complete me. We're almost there! My students, who never ask for anything, were so fortunate to receive tables for our classroom and now we just need the chairs. They are grateful for everything they get, so to have a classroom that feels welcoming and comfortable, means increased creativity and motivation. Chairs will get us to the finish line. As a writing teacher, I know the difference that seating can make for effective and focused writing. These chairs will serve hundreds over many years to come.

Many of our students are on a free and reduced cost lunch program (46% of our population), and we have a high proportion of English language learners on our campus (32%). Despite this, our school has a vibrant campus culture with clubs and activities going on during lunch and recess most days. The rallies and athletic events are well-supported and well-attended. It is my belief that our students deserve the same equipment in their science classrooms that other schools in our district routinely receive from parent donations; however, our science programs are often hampered by limited funding. My project does not have the excitement of many others as I am simply asking for the funding to purchase 1 electronic balance. A single electronic balance does not sound like it will make much of a difference but when you have twelve lab groups and one student from each group responsible for collecting data thats 12 students in line. A single functioning electronic balance added to the room can halve that line to 6, if my other two balances are working the lines drop down to 4.

Several of my students prefer the brightest light possible to see details. All of them benefit from the advances being made in technology for individuals with visual impairments.

Our classroom is full of movement. Students are constantly making up hand gestures, silly sayings, and songs to remember concepts. The kids work so hard, but often their bodies get in the way of their learning. The students in my class do best when they are moving or sitting in a position in which they learn best. Flexible seating invites creativity, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. Many of my students have trouble staying focused. Having multiple options for students to work at, aside from sitting in a basic chair or standing, is one way that helps my students to stay super engaged and on task. My students learn best when they are moving around in a controlled environment. Our class is in desperate need of more seating options to help meet the variety of needs in our classroom. With a shorter amount of time for recess and special areas, like p.e., students need flexible seating to meet the needs of their body. The immediate benefits of flexible seating include burning more calories, using up excess energy, improving metabolism, increased motivation and engagement, creating a better oxygen flow to the brain, and improving core strength and overall posture. Physical activity is linked to higher academic performance, better health, and improved behavior. Stability balls, wobble chairs, and saucer chairs will provide my 25 students the best environment to do their best learning.

In spite of the many hardships that they face as newcomers to the United States, they demonstrate resilience. These children deserve the best education because they are leaders who live with hope, hope for a better life. A child may have witnessed a father's suicide or a mother's death in a war torn country, but the child comes into the classroom with a smile wanting to learn. A child may have experienced neglect having never been spoken to for the first 4 years of his life, but the child comes to the classroom willing to take risks and try learning new words in English. A child may have experienced hunger, but the child advocates for his baby brother and asks to take milk home to him so the baby stops crying from hunger. A child's may be awake all night from bed bugs and lice, but the child can ignore the persistent itch, stay awake, and focus on what the teacher is saying. These students deserve the very best. Young children need to be engaged in positive early learning experiences. For many children, kindergarten is their first school experience. For newcomers, first grade is often their first school experience. In spite of the pressure for children to be reading by the end of kindergarten, learning still needs to encourage curiosity and incite joy. Kids learn best through play. Letter names and sounds can be introduced in creative ways. For example, I can have puppets such as 'Ellie Elephant' introduce objects beginning with the letter e from the soup cans. Children can put them in the play soup bowl, and use the soup spoon to laddle up sounds. As for the book Alligarors All Around, there is a corresponding song by Carole King.

Many of my kiddos were born and raised here in Oakland and unfortunately, most of them come from households that struggle financially. Our school is predominantly students of color and 100% free and reduced lunch. My students' enthusiasm is contagious and their determination is inspiring. They have shown a strong desire to express themselves through the arts and we'd love to provide them with the opportunities to do so. They are such creative individuals who amaze me everyday with their imagination, drive, and excitement for the arts. Their desire to try new experiences is amazing. For the very first time, our school is offering our students the opportunity to participate in the performing arts through the Jungle Book Musical. This amazing experience will allow them to express themselves through a variety of ways that they haven't had before. One such way is through set design. This is where we need your help. I am asking for construction paper and paint to provide our students with the materials necessary to build our Jungle Book set. Currently, they are struggling with imagining what the entire musical will look like. By providing my students with these materials, they will be able to use their imagination and creativity to design their very own musical set. The goal is for our students to be actively involved in every part of the process. We are requesting construction paper to build the actual jungle. This will be used by the students to design their own trees, bushes, and plants. We are also requesting paint for the students to add their own amazing details to our jungle props. Finally, we are requesting face paint for students to wear on the day of their performance. We'd love to make this a possibility for our kiddos. Thank you so much for your support!

I want these kids to know they are special, worthy, and capable of success. I want them to have an experience where they read about people who are similar to themselves, and I want them to fall in love with a book, possibly for the first time in their lives. First, I want my students to see someone actually cares about them. I want them to know they are important enough to have new books picked especially for them. Many of my students have been told by teachers and adults they will never amount to anything and they won't amount to much in this world. I want them to see that someone recognizes the potential in them, enough to put this request out there, and enough to buy books for them. Many of my kids have never finished a single book. Through these titles kids will be empowered, because not only will they be reading a high interest book, they will see their own lives reflected in the stories they are reading. They will see stories riddled by tragedy that are also stories of success. They will see stories of people overcoming hardship and becoming better individuals in the process.

In total, I have over 300 students that take my class each semester. I have four units planned for the remainder of the year. All of the lessons use different materials and are listed below. The first lesson is to design a flag. Students will analyze different flags and come up with their own design. Students will sew or hot glue cut fabrics to complete their design. The second lesson I have planned is block printing. We already have Linoleum blocks, but we are in need of ink in different colors. Students will carve their design into the linoleum and then print on paper. The third lesson will be designing and building a clay mask. Students will look at masks of specific cultures or regions, then create their own design. Students will create an oil pastel landscape of a Minnesota location. They will use multiple layers of oil pastels to recreate a scene that is significant to their lives. My class is often the only place students have the opportunity to learn in a hands-on and independent way.

My students are inquisitive and love to ask questions and look for answers, especially about nature and animals. Later this spring we will begin a science and language arts unit on Amazing Creatures that my students are already anticipating! They love to learn about large animals, scary looking sharks with big teeth, and ask and answer questions about the dinosaurs. With these materials my students will be able to enhance their study of animals. The Animals Magnetic Activity Tin will allow students to sort and classify animals while using new science vocabulary. As they work the puzzles they will use problem solving skills and learn about sea animals and insects. We will use the books in small groups as students practice non-fiction reading strategies. The books will also be available for students to use during self-selected reading and to choose as take-home books for homework. Sharing their new learning with families is exciting and brings families into what we are learning at school, too! I will set up a science station with the model animals and students will be able to 'play' with the animals in their habitats, learning about how the animals find food and water. Another station will have the life cycle models for students to sequence and write about in blank books that I will provide. The 3D models of theses life cycle stages will be much more engaging than the black and white pictures that come with our science curriculum. Kindergartners love to touch, manipulate, and talk about what they are learning about. I try to make as much learning as possible hands-on for my students. Taking science out of a 30 minute whole group lesson into our independent center time and also integrating it into our language arts lessons makes it more exciting and real for the students.

Since December, I have been teaching the YogaCalm curriculum to my K-6th students inside their individual classrooms. My kiddos cannot afford their own yoga mats and neither can our school's limited school counseling and health budgets. We have been forced to either stick with chairs, use small classroom spaces throughout the room, or use the music room where there is old carpeting. The magical and special element of each student have his or her own mat to use during YogaCalm instruction would be such an amazing, positive sensory addition for our yoga work. Having a mat enhances the unique and individualized experience for the children, and I would be able to introduce dried flowers, scented oils, leaves, stones, and other natural elements into my YogaCalm lessons if the kids had provided mats.

Many of our students face challenges that even adults would have difficulty with. Our team works actively to find each student's special talent and guide them toward life success through character building and the 7 habits of highly effective people. As a Leader in Me Lighthouse School we teach students the habits to be successful regardless of circumstance. When you walk into my classroom you will see students using their personal artistic voices, exploring movement, listening, following and creating their own dance movement. Students who have difficulty learning math are suddenly learning mathematics easily through movement. Students having trouble with letter recognition are creating the shapes of letters with their bodies and using the letter sounds to create the music they will perform to. We are using the performing arts to overcome the affects of poverty and empower our students. These books will give low-income students in grades PreK-5 access to reading activities directly connected to their passion, dance. Students will increase literacy as we dance, read and write using these books during our performing arts dance class. Our class will expand literacy while adding to their understanding of what dance is, how we dance and who dances. It will be easier to meet statewide and national standards for education with the proper materials in our classroom that are easily accessible. Students will learn to read through multiple intelligences and cross-curricular learning will be able to occur readily.

Our students learn differently through autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, sanfillipo syndrome along with varying physical and intellectual abilities. We pride ourselves on growing our knowledge through experiences inside the classroom through art, gardening, cooking, and sensory integration and outside of the school through trips and experiences in the community. We learn valuable life-skills and work daily to communicate effectively with our peers and interact with the amazing world around us. My exuberant kiddos can be quite tough on our library and audio equipment and sometimes struggle with the feeling of traditional headphones on their ears. Funds will be used for multiple pairs of headphones with varying durability and features (flexible, headbands, noise-canceling) to meet the needs of the different students in my room, a CD player with easy to use and clear buttons, headphone adapters, a set of audio-books for use in the center as well as some replacement books, and a set of ‘indestructible’ books for students that are waiting for their turn in the audio-book center. My students don't always learn in traditional ways so my goal as their teacher is to provide multiple entry points for my students to connect to learning and create a welcoming and accessible space. There are numerous benefits to having technology available to expand reading experiences and increase independence for reading. Multiple books provide choice and opportunities for choice-making. Improved reading skills, task independence, and reading interest are just some of the expected outcomes for this amazing class. We're so excited to dive into reading!

Many of them have lacked motivation in the past and many have lots of drama in their lives that have contributed to poor success in school. Interesting activities often spark a renewed interest in education that puts them on the right path for a successful life. They really appreciate being able to do special activities that usually only the comprehensive school sites that they came from are able to fund. My students want to take thrown out school food and compost it anaerobically to produce superior worm food. The daphnia and duckweed will all be fed to the fish which are producing waste to feed our plants. This project allows students to experience the rewards of recycling. They will observe how nutrient cycling by micro-organisms benefits higher trophic levels. Their aquaponic set up will now have its own food supply courtesy of the garbage can. The bokashi mix uses yeast and bacteria to ferment food scraps which then get added to the vermiculture to be finished off by red worms. Worm castings are great plant fertilizer and the worms keep the fish happy and healthy. Students will be engaged by this hands-on activity that will not only help them with biology, but also help them to be more thoughtful global citizens.

We need more graphic novel choices to help keep our growing readers reading. I would like high-interest, engaging, graphic novels to promote a culture of literacy among my 6th grade students. Everyday, students read choice-novels in class, and many students choose graphic novels. Reading graphic novels not only improves comprehension but also skills such as inference, memory, and sequencing. The graphic novels in this project span several genres, expanding the options that students will have for independent choice reading. The content in many of the graphic novel series, such as Dork Diaries and Smile, are age and developmentally relevant to my students.

Most of the students are bilingual and don’t start speaking English until they begin Kindergarten. At home they do not have access to many books or technology needed to strive in the twenty first century. Their only exposure to these things is when they are at school or what they bring from school to use at home. Despite all of their hardships and struggles they come to school everyday happy and ready to learn!At the school that I teach at the enrollment hovers around 700 students. Many of the students love to read but aren’t challenged enough. This year a group of teachers decided to change this and brought Battle of the Books to our school. It was a huge success. If you don’t know what that is I’ll explain it for you. Battle of the Books is when the students read books from a list. The books on the list are of various difficulty but picked to challenge students. Teams are formed and they compete in a day of competition answering questions about the books they read. Eventually, it comes down to two teams and a final battle. After the final battle a winner is crowned! It is a fun and exciting event that we hope to continue for years to come. In order for us to continue the competition we need multiple copies of high interest but challenging books for our next competition. One of the awesome things about Battle of the Books is that students can read the books individually or teachers can read them with their class. The book and audiobook (so students can listen to the book and follow along) that I am requesting is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The students at my school love the Harry Potter series but many have not read the books but have seen the movies. We all know the movie version of a book is often very different from the book itself.

Our students are encouraged and supporting in maintaining their home languages as well as English. Our students are special because they grow up in a diverse urban neighborhood. They have a unique perspective on languages and cultures. It is normal for them to encounter others who speak a different language or experience a culture than their own. Our students love to learn how to do somersaults, cartwheels and do back bends. Do you remember learning this as a child in school? The students feel so strong and confident when they can accomplish a cartwheel and round off. These mats will make a difference in our program because the current mats we are using are over 50 years old. They are worn and the stuffing is exposed and they are beginning to break down. The exposed stuffing is hard to clean and new mats would keep the gym clean.

Beyond our doors, they will be entering the workforce without the supports and protection offered by our staff. They will need to be able to fend for themselves. Each student is unique and their needs are all different. Every day they are honored for their abilities and praised for their successes! Our school focuses beyond graduation when it comes to teaching our students to be successful in post-school life. Our school is broken down into 3 'Pathways' to independence. Our Pathway students attend a federal setting 4 special education program to support their needs and get them ready for post-graduation life. Many of the students at our school are diagnosed with severe and profound developmental disabilities including Autism and Severe Multiple Impairments. Our school is filled with committed staff who create a meaningful school experience for all students and their unique needs. Our last project funded a Virtual Reality 360 Maker Space for students and staff to invent, adapt, dream, and overcome disabilities in and outside of class time. Combined with our 3D printer and LEGO Ev3 systems, the new Raspberry Pi systems and VR headsets have made our Maker Space a buzz of excitement at school. It is time to add functional sensors and haptic feedback systems to the Maker Space so that our students can reach their STEM goals through the creation of a fully immersive virtual reality cockpit. With customizable haptic feedback pressure suits paired with our VR 360 camera's footage, the physical limitations of my students will 'virtually' disappear and allow them to experience life beyond a window pane. Some of my students have great anxiety about traveling to new places whether it be in the community or the greater world. Their anxiety can sometimes produce behaviors that can be detrimental to their ability to experience things along with their peers. Students and staff will have the opportunity to record their travels along the same routes and arrive at the destinations using our 360 VR cameras, we can then use the Raspberry Pi systems along with touchscreens and VR Goggles to broadcast the footage to the students having anxiety. If they are able to view the route with 360 degrees of perspective, they may gain familiarity with it and possibly have reduced anxiety when they travel the route in person. The Maker Space will be available outside of normal school hours, as well as on weekends for students and staff to access. Skills in math and science can be taught and learned through coding for the Pi's, creating CAD designs for the 3D printer, and creating / adapting assistive technology.",My students need the technology to to bring our VR 360 Maker Space to the next level!,"Math & Science, Special Needs",Grades 9-12,Technology,676.06,Fully Funded

We do not have textbooks for math so as a teacher I always look for the most engaging ways to introduce these topics. My students will benefit from having interactive math centers, in which they can use mathematical reasoning to apply the skills we learn in class. Mathematical reasoning is not just about solving equations. These operations activity centers allow students to use counters, draw models, or mental math to solve given problems. The place value center will give my students the solid foundation of understanding how the base ten system and place value work, so they can apply this knowledge in all future grades. Lastly, an important skill in kindergarten math is to be able to quickly solve sums of ten. This skill is the crucial prior knowledge needed for regrouping in subtraction, that comes in first grade.

They come to my room for small group instruction in reading, writing, math, and/or social skills. Most of my students are also English language learners. My students rely on consistent routines and access to models and visual examples of the tasks they are completing. They depend on engaging learning experiences that meet them at their individual instructional levels and tap into their personal interests. Most importantly, they depend on having access to the resources that support their individual instructional needs. My biggest challenge as a special education teacher is providing my students with an ever-changing supply of reading materials at their individual reading levels and interests. My school's community is very supportive of all of our learners, but our budget is very tight. While we are fortunate to have a great leveled library, it doesn't have enough breadth for my learners, who take longer to progress from one reading level to another.

I want to set my students up for success by providing them with organization skills in kindergarten that will last them throughout their years in school. My students are from Northeast Houston. They come to school excited to learn and work hard everyday. One of my goals is to show them how to be more organized, in order to help them be more successful throughout school. Most of my students come to kindergarten without ever going to preschool and some have never been away from Mom or Dad. The school environment is new to them and their success depends on keeping all of their materials organized. Organization is a skill they must learn early on in school. In kindergarten students are expected to learn how to read beginner books, fluently complete math facts and write readable stories. All of these tasks require different materials that students need to be able to sort between. These chair sacks will put students on the right path towards becoming autonomous and able to take control of their own learning. Students will use these chair sacks everyday in class to hold books, folders, notebooks, as well as pencils, crayons, and erasers. Students will learn how to keep their materials organized by being responsible for their individual chair sacks. Each day in our classroom we transition between multiple different subjects including phonics, reading, writing and math. Students will be able to make this transition much more smoothly with all of their materials conveniently located on the back of their chair in one of these chair sacks. Transitions take up a lot of time in any elementary classroom. I am hoping to minimize transition time in my classroom with these chair sacks. Shorter transitions means more time actually spent learning. Every minute for my students is precious and the more minutes we can spend learning rather than transitioning will greatly increase their achievement. Donating to this project will make a huge difference in my classroom by saving transition time and helping my students become more organized and self sufficient.

Everyday they are excited to learn new concepts and skills despite their learning and/or physical disabilities. My observant group of students love the opportunities awarded in and outside the classroom and are a pleasure to teach.

After providing standard kid answers: video games, dessert every night, better food in the cafeteria, I clarified my question, 'No, not what do you want? But what do you deserve... as a human being?' The tone in the room changed immediately. Students grew quiet, reflective, thoughtful. As they patiently listened to each other, I was floored by their answers. One of my girls told our community she deserved a dad that was at home with her, not in prison. One boy said he deserved a quiet place to read at home. Another said he deserved neighbors who did not play loud music in the apartment next door so late at night.

Upon arrival, students are whisked back into life in the 1840s on the Oregon Trail. In teams, they role play different aspects of life on the trail. Some of the activities students participate in are making candles, twisting rope, and taking a nature hike. They also get to explore tools, build a log cabin, pack a wagon, knead bread and churn butter. For many of our students, this is truly a once in a life time experience. In addition to the Oregon Trail activities, students also bond as a community. They cook their dinner together outside on handmade stoves, participate in a campfire and dance the Virginia Reel.

I believe using the wobble chairs, rug, balance balls, and stools I have in my project will allow my students to keep their bodies comfortable while working independently and whole group as well as maintaining their stamina their brains need while thinking and learning! Flexible classrooms give students a choice in what kind of learning space works best for them, and helps them to work collaboratively. I spend numerous hours preparing lessons to meet all the diverse needs in my classroom, and I would love to allow my students to be able to choose a flexible setting to succeed to their fullest potential. Students will do their very best in a space where they are comfortable and confident. I love learning from my students, and they make me smile on a daily basis! It is an incredible feeling!

I try to include a read aloud in every subject multiple times a week, and we play lots of games in the classroom to build reading and math skills! To continue the fun at home, I print games monthly to send home for them to play with family. I believe these games are more appropriate than homework and contribute to quality family time.

That is because people don't know how amazing my students are. I teach in a low income/high-poverty school with a high immigrant population. My students often struggle with language and a lack of resources (such as books) at home. Yet they come every day with a thirst for knowledge. As an 8th grade teacher, the key to keeping students engaged is to relate their learning to their own struggles. It matters to them -- if it is about them. I love teaching English, because there are so many engaging, relatable stories written for and about the teenage experience. But my students won't read books at home if I don't provide them. This project will allow me to send home books with my classes for at home reading practice. Many of my middle school students like to tell me that they don't read. But what if they could see themselves in the characters they read about? What if they could relate to the struggles of the characters on the page? Would they change their minds about the importance of books? I know that if provided with the right books to take home, my students will experience a change in attitude about reading. My goal for my students is for them to develop a reading habit through books which they find relatable, engaging, and appealing. I've picked 3 selections to rotate among my classes for nightly take-home reading. The Maze Runner is a dystopian novel where a boy named Thomas finds himself trapped in the center of a maze with no memory of his previous life. It is a compelling adventure story in which the main character must not only survive, but escape. The Giver is a story about a boy, Jonas, who lives in a society where grief and discord have been eliminated and 'sameness' is a virtue. Jonas struggles as he learns the painful truth of individuality and emotion. Last, A Wrinkle in Time is a classic science fiction novel about a girl named Meg, an awkward teen who struggles in school. She must travel across time and space to save her Father and her younger brother from a dark force trying to take over the universe. All of these selections have teenage protagonists who struggle in some way with survival and navigating through the difficult circumstances of life.

Our seating needs to match our collaborative student-centered curriculum. Wobble chairs help improve posture and allow wiggly first grade students a chance to move and learn. The Gaiam Kids Balance Ball Chairs also offer the students an opportunity to choose seating that is comfortable for them. These chairs also improve posture, and the frame that holds the balance balls in place are a more stable option for first grade students. Additionally, I have requested more ergonomically friendly chairs, the Contour School Stack Chairs. These chairs are more of a traditional style seat, but with increased comfort for growing children. Any help is appreciated, thank you for stopping by.","My students need a choice in their classroom seating.

All of my students have one or more disabilities which adversely affect their ability to communicate their wants and needs, thoughts, and ideas. Though communication is not easy for my students, they have a determination to learn like none other! All of my students have one or more disabilities, ranging from speech sound disorders to autism and down syndrome, which negatively affects their ability to effectively communicate their wants and needs, thoughts, and ideas. They come to speech to work on expressing themselves more effectively, as well as their articulation and language skills. My school is phenomenal and always strives to include our students with special needs in all activities school-wide. Though many of my students come from difficult backgrounds, they have a desire to learn and succeed. Many of my students require visual picture reminders to follow a schedule, use good behavior, and answer comprehension questions about what they have been learning. Some of my students have more severe needs, which hinders them from communicating verbally at all. These students rely on using gestures and pictures to communicate with others. My students all have a burning desire to interact with others and express themselves. New books keep the students engaged in learning. Because my students have disabilities that cause them to struggle with attention, we often play board games in speech as a way for my students to continue to work on vocabulary, practice communicating with others and turn-taking, practice social skills such as how to win and lose graciously, and also for short breaks to help them decompress. The board games chosen for our project were carefully selected to go along with our themes throughout the year, so as to be a continuation of the vocabulary words we are targeting. For example, Pop Up Pirate will be used during our Pirate theme week. We'll decorate our classroom with pirate decor, read pirate books, learn pirate vocabulary, and practice talking like pirates. Then, we have a pirate-themed game for reinforcement of their speech goals! Likewise, the selected books such as Pout Pout Fish and Pierre the Penguin, as well as the game Thin Ice, specifically relate to other themes we will be studying, such as the Arctic and ocean! My school's resources are extremely limited. Budgets for new games and books are non-existent at this time. My students look forward to coming to speech to read books and sometimes play games. What may seem like play time to them, is really a carefully designed social skills lesson or communication opportunity. My lessons change as themes and vocabulary change, and as the students' needs change. It is vital for me to continue to provide activities that keep my students engaged in their learning so they can find a voice that they so desperately want.

By the end of third grade, students are expected to master multiplication and division facts to 100. One of the biggest challenges that I face is getting students to meet grade level expectations without the proper supplies to meet their learning needs. Students don’t come in a cookie cutter shape, they are all individuals from different backgrounds and with different types of learning abilities. Let me introduce you to my classroom! I am a third grade math teacher in a low income school. I teach three math periods throughout the day with ninety minute blocks and sixty students transitioning in and out of my classroom. Some of my students are English Language Learners, special education students, and highly capable and gifted students. Student ability levels range anywhere from intensive, strategic, and benchmark. Approximately 48 percent of the students receive free or reduced lunch. Expecting students to sit still in a chair for a ninety-minute block is a big expectation, especially for eight and nine year olds. This is something that students are expected to do on a daily basis. Something as simple as sitting on a chair becomes an enormous task for students that are already at a disadvantage in their education. Students are all expected to meet grade level expectations, no matter what level they were at in the beginning of third grade. It is up to me, their math teacher, to meet every single students' needs. Students don't come in a one size fits all, and their learning styles most definitely does not. My students need more seating options that fit their needs. I am requesting 2 wobble chairs that allow my students to continuously be moving while they are working.

It is incredible to witness how much pride our students have developed caring for the overall Environmental Concerns our school and the world. In order to expand our reach and continue our push to zero waste at 90, the students are in need of more supplies. We need more gloves because right now our 50 member team has to share and they are very time consuming to clean. The trash grabbers would make the students lives easier during recycling collections and during lunch duty. We are currently borrowing recycling bins and rolling dollies and with the purchase of new bins we can collect more and cut down on the time needed to clear a school of 700 people. Hours collecting will turn into minutes. The other supplies will also be used to make recycling the main focus in our school and community. The most important lesson we have learned is that although the work that we do takes much time and planning, it is all worth it when we see the pride that has developed in our students. The students of the green team have spread their knowledge and joy over recycling to their peers, and there has been a paradigm shift within our school because of these students. Although there are limitations with beginning to implement new protocols in a school, when we see the gratification that recycling brings to our students, it is all worth it.

The students I teach come from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds, and many of them speak another language at home. Our 7th Graders are becoming teenangers and facing increased social and acadmic pressure. Additionally, many of my students face hardships outside of school, and over half of them come from low-income households. Each day, we take risks together, learning and growing in preparation for the world beyond our classroom door. We learn empathy, travel the world, and find ourselves through the books we read and the words we write. For many of my students, the only books to which they have access are books at school. By building a diverse classroom library in my first year at the junior high level, my students will be able to seamlessly move from book to book. Unlimited access to a large volume of appropriate text will help my students to grow as readers and have experiences they may not have had otherwise. In books, we can find both windows to the world and mirrors of our lives. With your help, our library will expose students to both classic middle grade texts, like The Hobbit, as well as modern best sellers like Everything, Everything by Nicola Yoon. Many of the books on this list have been specifically requested by students or recommended by librarians. Some of these books are even my favorites from when I was in middle school, like The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series. I will be putting each of these books in a 'spotlight' throughout the year by promoting the book to students at the beginning of class through a book talk, which is like a movie preview.

Every school year our district is faced with making cuts, and this often comes down to necessary resources and materials for my students. They face challenges outside of the school, and have to deal with limited resources in school. These supplies are the basic materials that the children need to complete all of their work. All of these supplies will help improve the children's fine motor skills. The children will use the pencils and crayons to create beautiful illustrations, and then become writers. The journals will be used daily to see if children understand story elements. The children will eventually write words, sentences, and stories with these supplies. The glue sticks will help students with independent practice of key concepts that require cut and paste.

Technology is a must have tool to help implement such skills to the students.  Integrating technology to young students is nothing new. Kids are becoming more tech savvy than most adults.

We are located in the East Rogers Park area of the City of Chicago. 95% of the students population receives free or reduced lunch. Because of this, money is spent on the necessities and not on technology. This means my students do not have the same access to technology in the classroom as other schools and other students. My middle school students are eager to learn and excited to share what they have already learned. Technology in the classroom provides us with endless opportunities to both share what we have learned and to continue to learn. My goal is to prepare my middle school students for what comes after they leave my classroom and this school. In order to do that I must provide them with the tools and the opportunities to use technology on a regular basis. Ensuring that supplies such as pens, pencils, erasers, paper, and textbooks are readily available for my students is a constant battle. There are never enough of the most important things we need in order to produce our best work. Luckily enough, there is a solution to this pesky problem. We would like to make our classroom green, how will we do this? By becoming a Google Classroom, classroom!

Long gone are desks in my room. They've been replaced with tables and stools. I'm asking for two more cafe tables and tall stools to make my class complete. My students love to move around the classroom. These cafe tables and chairs allow them to relax and have deeper conversations to understand each other better. I've listened to more cooperative discussions at these tables. They'll use them to sit at during class lessons, working on projects, wordprocessing on their Chromebooks.

My students come from a variety of backgrounds, and together we create a wonderful second grade family! This will be the first year I am teaching math! I am eager to put my little mathematicians to work with engaging and hands-on materials to practice second grade math skills. My students need multiplication and subtraction flash cards, dice, decks of cards for math games, color counting chips, and timers as tools to enhance their mathematical understanding during independent centers. Additionally, I would like to have a hundreds chart posted in the room for students to use as reference throughout the year. Lastly, I am requesting a Lego storage container to store math building materials and a pocket chart to make rotating weekly student jobs a breeze. We can't wait to get started learning math!

My students are racially, ethnically, and economically diverse--30% African American, 30% Asian/Pacific Islander, 25% Caucasian, and 15% Hispanic. Free and reduced-price lunch students make up 78% of our total population, 24% of students receive Special Education services and 31% are Multi-Language Learners. My students' family backgrounds are also varied. There are many single-parent households, lower-income families, homeless families, abusive family dynamics, mental health issues, as well as some students with very little trauma in their home lives. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages at home, many of my students struggle with academics. That is one of the reasons that I am so grateful to share this time with them and to support their growth and independence. We work together to learn, play, grow, and create a community of hope and respect in our classroom. Access to technology is a critical component of classroom learning because 80% of the lessons and 90% of the class work is posted on Schoology. We are a one-to-one iPad classroom, using apps like: Schoology, IXL, Buzzmath, Quizlet, etc. Students are learning to be responsible for their iPads, but they need access to a charging station, stylus', and a document camera to foster a more interactive learning experience. These tools will allow them to more readily explain their reasoning and share the logic behind their problem solving with their peers. Students succeed best at mathematics when they can observe how to set up an interactive math notebook, take Cornell notes, and use notes to complete their class work and study for tests. The document camera will make it easier to model how to do these things, as well as helping students prepare for quizzes and tests. These additional tools will allow easy access to technology while creating a positive and collaborative classroom learning environment where all function equally as students, explorers, and teachers to grow as a math learners.","My students need access to the following technologies to foster a more interactive classroom learning environment where they can share their work: iPad charging station, iPad stylus' and a document camera.",Math & Science,Grades 6-8,Technology,923.05,Fully Funded

They love learning new concepts in science, and they love talking about the world around them. Especially when it comes to issues that hit home with them, from race politics to school lunches. Our school is in a poor urban neighborhood, so students don't have a lot of reading material at home, and internet access is spotty, usually on a tiny cellphone. Most of them don't have the opportunity to take many vacations beyond the borders of our state, so we have to rely on books, magazines and the internet to broaden their understanding of the world. My students spend hours on the internet without necessarily thinking critically about what they read, see, and hear. They have many misconceptions about science and current events, and we are able to use Scholastic News magazine to tackle some of these misconceptions, as well as hone reading comprehension skills. We are requesting a class subscription to Scholastic News. Scholastic News does an excellent job of factual journalism for kids. Having this print resource is invaluable in our fifth grade classroom to keep up with what's really going on in the world. The teacher lesson plans and reading comprehension questions that come along with the magazine provide a standards-aligned starting point.

I find myself going 'the extra mile' for my students. I want to make learning fun for them because they bring so much joy to my heart! My students need pre-packaged snacks for the first week of school and reusable water bottles to use throughout the school year. What's worse than being hot, hungry, and unhappy on those LONG days during the first week of school? Most of my Kindergartners will be experiencing a full day of school for the first time - in the August heat! Many of them will come to school without breakfast and lunch. Luckily, the school provides that! But come late afternoon, my poor Kindergartners are going to be tired, cranky, and hungry! In addition, they come back to school in mid-August - at the peak of Cleveland heat! Unfortunately, we don't have air conditioning in the building, so we try to tough it out by staying hydrated! With this project, not only will my Kindergartners have full bellies, they will also get their very own reusable water bottle to stay hydrated through the school year! The snacks will ensure that every student has a snack. In addition, I'll be able to send home granola bars to students to have as a snack over teh weekend. I'm not sure which students will be getting a full meal for dinner when they get home, so I want to make sure I'm able to have something to give them. In addition, the water bottles will ensure that all of my students are in class, learning, and bonding with their classmates - not going to the other side of the building for a drink of water!

My hope is for these games to be fun, encourage cooperative play/movement, and also connect with my scholars interests! Movement throughout the day is so important for all children. I know that if I have an area in my room for scholars to visit if they are needing extra movement, it will help them learn. A trampoline will be perfect for the scholars to get some jumping in inside of the classroom. I plan to use the basketball hoop in several ways. I look forward to encouraging my scholars to make a basket everyday, and teach about the importance or team work, good sportsmanship, and taking turns. It is not very often you see a basketball hoop INSIDE the classroom. I can't wait to see the reaction of my scholars. The indoor football target and beanbag toss will also be a great addition to the movement area in the room. The scholars will have several choices.

My students come from diverse backgrounds, however, they all have one thing in common- their creativity and conscientious attitude in the classroom. I teach a group of academically advanced 2nd graders which means they are working above their current grade level. With my students' minds working at such a fast pace, it is evident that their bodies want to do the same. They all have such unique personalities and bring so much life to our classroom. My students' minds amaze me each and every day. They are such creative thinkers and are constantly thinking outside the box. However, their little bodies need to be moving. They need to be comfortable. I have been researching the idea of flexible seating and am ready to implement it into my classroom. The idea scared me at first but if my students can think outside the box, so can I! Throughout this past year, I continued to notice how much the students wanted and needed to be moving around while they are working. They loved sitting around the room over sitting in their chairs. Students showed so much more on task behavior and creativity in their work- I was amazed! This would give them the opportunity to work in a more comfortable and conducive environment to showcase their work. Currently, we have enough flexible seating for four students along with carpet squares. The stools that I'm requesting will help with my fidgety students who like to move while they work due to the wobbling ability of the stool. The comfy floor seat gives students who still want to sit in a traditional chair a more comfortable way of doing so while still completing their work on clipboards. We also do a lot of collaborative work and each of the groups need to spread out in order to have enough space to work cooperatively. The soft seats will allow the groups who are on the floor a space to complete their group work.

The materials I requested will enhance student learning and build social skills as they work together on different activities. Rory’s Story Cubes have pictures with different themes like verbs, ways to move, places to visit. The students will roll 2-3 of the cubes and using the pictures along with their imagination they will combine them into a story. The Magna-Tiles are sized just right for little hands and easy to use to create a design on a flat surface or building in 3-D. Magna-Tiles develops patterning, shape recognition, building, and motor skills. The WonderFoam Dominos will be used for number tile matching games, sorting, counting, addition, and subtraction practice. I think the AGARE Brain Flakes will be a favorite. This is a set of interlocking snowflake shaped plastic disks. Students can build and learn. My students are excited about starting their day with these activities.

When I came to this school it had just received an F, which meant it was a failing school. In my classroom, at least half of my students were one to three grade levels behind. Coming from low socio-economic backgrounds they come to my classroom missing background knowledge and experiences. However, I teach my students to dream and aspire to be more than their current circumstances.I teach my students that no matter what kind of neighborhood you grow up in, they too can leave a great impact on the world. I grew up in the same neighborhood and came back after going to college to make a difference. Many of my students have difficulty focusing and sitting their seat. Brain research shows that these types of students greatly benefit from alternate seating. I want to provide each one of my students with their very own bouncy band. Bouncy bands allow students to move while completing their work. Students will stay focused in class better when they have a way to get some relief when they feel hyperactive, anxious, stressed or frustrated. Using up excess energy improves metabolism, increases motivation and engagement, creating a better oxygen flow to the brain. Physical activity is linked to higher academic performance, better health, and improved behavior. It is also great for students with ADD and ADHD. I believe the bouncy bands will create a better learning environment for my students.

We have great community supports and partnerships as well. In our classroom, we have 23 students who weave a colorful fabric of different languages, racial and economic diversity, as well as athletic and artistic talents. My students bring to the classroom a wealth of cultural, linguistic, racial, religious, socioeconomic and academic differences. It is therefor important for these students to not only be able to identify with characters in the books they are reading but expose themselves to the differences in others. I want to empower my students with knowledge as well as compassion and advocacy for others.

Most citizens can describe the traditional 'American Dream' as the right and ability to carve out any life you choose. Unfortunately, for children, not all opportunities are equal. My students are the picture of America. They come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and vastly varied, socioeconomic lifestyles. Each child comes with their own life experiences, strengths, and weaknesses. They all want to feel safe and successful, and every one of them brings the need and desire to be loved. My students are curious, humorous, and zealous. They enjoy learning with their eyes, ears, and hands. As a classroom family, students work together, learn from each other, and strive for personal goals of personal best. Often times, students believe that reading is restricted to books. This can be overwhelming for students who lack confidence. This project will bring a bit of liberty to the classroom. Reading is reading. Building literacy requires more than an accomplished list of book titles. When time, stamina, or even interest is limited, many students simply choose not to read. My hope is that adding a fresh supply of kid friendly magazines will remove some of that pressure. Perhaps a novel full of chapters seems too daunting. Start with an article! Maybe sports heroes are more motivational that fantasy characters! So they can read Sports Illustrated Kids. Why not start your animal research with some fun facts from a sidebar in Zoobooks?

The reason DCS is so small is because we are, in essence, a modern-day, one-room schoolhouse. Our students are taught every subject in mixed-grade classes. We find, with the right amount of differentiating the material for the older and younger students, the students mentor one another, find role models, observe what struggle and humility look like. Our students are on a constant search to nurture and satisfy their sense of intellectual curiosity. To them and their families, education is the first priority in life. Because of the economic hardships many of our families face, they understand the connection between receiving a high-quality education and achieving success in life. We consider our school's curriculum to be extremely rigorous, and our expectations of our students are high. Our school represents the rich ethnic and racial spectrum of the city of Newark. Our students and staff are African-American, Caribbean, Caucasian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern: Muslim, Protestant, Jewish and Catholic. There are students whose families have been in Newark for decades, and students whose families have just arrived here from abroad: all-in-all our school community represents over 30 countries from around the world.DCS kicks off the coming school year with a school-wide, interdisciplinary unit of study on our city: Newark, NJ. The title of the unit is 'Newark: Revolution, Rebellion and Rebirth'. One of the periods we will focus on in-depth is the Newark Riots of 1967, also known as the Newark Rebellion. I am seeking literature to teach in English Language Arts which will enrich the students' knowledge of that period in American history, specifically as it relates to the African-American's struggle for civil rights in the 1960s. The 'March' Trilogy is a perfect vehicle to teach my students one man's real-life account of social rebellion in the 1960s, written in a format to which they can relate easily. 'March' is a graphic novel, presented in three parts, the story of the life of Rep. John Lewis. The format of a graphic novel will gain critical buy-in from my students and give them an immediate feeling that the material is in an accessible format. The use of 'comic book' conventions, will naturally convey the urgency and drama of the events. I am positive that the combination of the powerful content of John Lewis' story and the inviting design of the graphic novel will give my students a vivid context through which to view what happened in Newark in July of 1967: how it could happen in America and why it had to happen.","My students need to study the 'March' trilogy, so they may analyze the trajectory of a life steeped in the social activism and racial turmoil of 1960s America.","History & Civics, Literacy & Language",Grades 6-8,Books,1017.21,Fully Funded

We provide special education, academic intervention, Title I, and ESL services. As a fifth grade educator, I have observed many success stories of students who challenge themselves, raising their expectations to higher levels, take on more responsibility, and become independent students. My goal is to prepare my students for middle school, leaving them with a passion, excitement for learning, and confidence. My diverse fifth grade classroom molds together 28 unique students, many of who come from bilingual households and receive free and reduced-price breakfast and lunch. My students come to school every day eager to learn and put their trust in me. Every student has a unique learning ability, and I want to give each individual the best learning experience by adapting my lessons to meet their individual needs. Incorporating engaging resources and hands-on manipulatives allows my students to work through self-discovery, ultimately leading to abstract reasoning. This educational philosophy, I believe, will promote not only good decision-making in the classroom, but also establish a fundamental lifelong skill. Our classroom is in need of reading materials to help our daily guided reading groups become more successful and engaging. The materials listed are examples of high-interest literature, which leads to confident and enthusiastic readers. Students will have a variety of genres to choose from while practicing state standard fiction and non-fiction reading skills. Students will be practicing skills such as cause and effect, close reading, comparing and contrasting texts, context clues, identifying theme and main idea, sequencing, reading for details, and making inferences. All of these materials will be used as an extension from our whole class mini lesson, and many of the resources also offer an interactive piece allowing students to complete a graphic organizer and other hands-on approaches for those visual learners.

I have watched my students use the few blocks we have to create skyscrapers, airports, race tracks, homes, castles, parking garages, ramps, towers, train stations, and even a zoo! Block building has been a powerful motivator for my bilingual students to learn to communicate with their peers, and it has allowed my special needs students to play successfully alongside their classmates. The most significant work the children do as they play, is learn to share ideas, and collaborate to complete their vision. Even students with limited vocabulary can communicate ideas, and participate in block play. My current wooden block collection is small, so only a small group of children can play with them. I would love to see many small groups using blocks to build toward a common goal. For example, if one group is building an airport, another group might build a parking garage or restaurant that would support the airport. Blocks can compliment any curriculum theme. I believe that vocabulary is a predictor of academic success. If a child can imagine it, build it, and talk about it, later that same child will be able to write about it, and share reasons for his or her own ideas and experiences. I love the statement, 'good writing is good thinking.' It is my belief, that by creating a classroom full of 'Block Heads', my students will think better, and in time, they will be able to write better, calculate better, reason better, and create better. Be a 'Block Head'.","My students need good old fashioned wooden building blocks to build vocabulary and foster cooperation, collaboration and creativity.",Math & Science,Grades PreK-2,Supplies,554.69,Fully Funded

There are chairs with cracked seats and missing slides, a mish-mash of other furniture, desks of all sizes in similar condition. It is simply an uncomfortable environment to learn in. My students deserve better. My students have special needs. It is more important than ever that they have safe, comfortable chairs to sit in in order to focus and learn. Currently, my classroom is furnished with left-overs. Some of the chairs have cracked seats and missing slides. They are made from various materials and are various sizes (some which don't fit the desks we use). There is not enough seating to allow for mainstreaming with other classes. Now, imagine a comfortably furnished classroom with enough seating for 15 to 20 students.

They represent a variety of social, cultural, and economic backgrounds, but all have one thing in common – a desire to learn. Upon entering my classroom, they are exposed to many opportunities to explore the world through structured and unstructured play. Through play, my students have the opportunity to develop their social skills through interacting with one another, practice and refine their understanding of language and number concepts, and learn to express themselves creatively. It is my goal, as their teacher, to foster a love of learning that they can carry forth into their elementary and secondary school years. Block play is recognized as a valuable tool in supporting the cognitive development of young learners. Block play can support children's emerging understandings of mathematical concepts, such as categorization, magnitude (bigger versus smaller), numbers, pattern & shape, spatial relations, and part-whole relationships. Given the benefits of block play I am requesting funds to purchase the following materials for use in my classroom: (a)Hardwood community vehicles set, (b) Lakeshore Community Garages, (c) Block play traffic signs, and (d) Block play home builder. I have several intended uses of these materials. First, the materials will be utilized by my students in the Block Play Center in my classroom, where they have opportunities to engage in (a) unstructured play and (b) teacher prompted activities involving constructive or dramatic play. Second, I will utilize thesematerials during the year when I provide direct small- and large-group instruction on the topics of Community Helpers and Transportation (both are units I cover), as well as mathematical concepts such as shape, size (absolute and relative), and number.

I want my students to enjoy their classroom and be engaged. These materials will help students be comfortable when sitting in the classroom, while continuing to concentrate on their school work. The seat discs allow physical movement, while mental motivation is still open for new information in the learning environment.

After already spending a year with my students in first grade, I know their strengths, weaknesses, and individual needs. Towards the end of first grade, I started offering students the option to sit on the carpet with clipboards, spread out across the rooms, lay down for writing, etc. I could not BELIEVE how much more engaged my students were and how much more work they were able to produce in a short amount of time. After just a couple weeks of introducing seating options to my students, I knew I had to move to a flexible seating classroom!My little scholars love to have choice and freedom; I am learning to let go (some), because of the responsibility and accountability that coincides with choice. I have already received the blessing to ditch my desks for tables, now I just need a variety of seats that will help optimize student learning and attention.

Our school is populated with the majority of students living below the poverty level, but that doesn't stop them from having high goals and expectations. I want to provide for them a friendly, colorful environment in which they can learn without being tied down to a desk! I began thinking about alternative seating as I sat in on the millionth teacher meeting. It started with me moving in my chair because I just could not get comfortable. Then I stood up. Then it was all I could think about. Then the light bulb went off as I said to myself,'If I am this uncomfortable sitting in a regular chair, my mind wandering, how in the world do my elementary school students feel?' This is when I knew I had to make a change. I have always been a teacher that did not care if students needed to move or fidget, as long as they did not disturb anyone else. By providing alternative seating arrangements, I hope to provide all of my students with the choice of a seat that will help them to better concentrate in the school setting and free them from the traditional 'sit and get' mentality that school can have. I am requesting Kids Stay and Play balance balls for each student that can be easily moved around the room and give students the ability to 'get the wiggles out'. Along with the balance balls, students will also have a choice of using wobble cushions on the floor or in a traditional chair, 2 larger 'balloon seats' and a class set of 'fidgets' that are used for kids that just need that something to do with their hands.

First graders are wiggly and inquisitive! I've taught first grade for the last three years and know that every group is very different. I am so excited to meet my new group of kiddos and to set up an exciting and welcoming classroom. Flexible seating is not only a trend in education, it provides life lessons in choice and problem solving. Tolerance us the ability or willingness to tolerate something, in particular the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with. Teachers and students alike practice tolerance each day when they make choices for both themselves and others. Flexible seating including bouncy bands and wiggle seats, and working with building materials are two examples of when students must tolerate each other and share. Students with choice have a sense of ownership and students who want to use the same materials must learn to problem solve and find compromise. Kayla Delzer, a pioneer in flexible seating says, 'I've found that some of the immediate benefits of flexible seating include burning more calories...increased motivation and engagement, creating a better oxygen flow to the brain, and improving core strength for over all posture.' If it's good for kids, it's good for classrooms. My project also includes some creative exploration items such as magnetic tiles and building blocks. So much of what we do in the classroom is academically focused that it is easy to forget that creativity and building challenges and exercises the brain in important ways as well.

While the students have an assortment of obstacles they face everyday, I also say that they are hard-working and intelligent individuals. It is my job to ensure that when they graduate; my students are prepared to be functioning citizens in society. As a teacher in a Title 1 school district, I observe that many of my student lack the basic necessities for school. I want my students to be successful in everything that they do. Many of my students come from low income families. They have to endure many difficulties that is too unbelievable to even fathom. School is often times their safe haven except for the hot months of May, June, September, and October. How can students possibly stay focused in class when their sweat is dripping down their faces and they are on the verge of fainting? My students attend a high school that is almost a hundred year old. All of the classrooms except for the main office have no AC and very little ventilation. During the hot months, some of my students fainted in the hallway. School is just too unbearable for these young learners when they have to deal with solving equations, breaking down formulas, and fanning themselves ferociously. Attendance in my classroom drop significantly during the hot months, because students don't want to stay in my hot classroom.

As the school begins, my students will make many new friends and will learn how the school day runs. I cannot wait to see what the rest of the school year brings as they grow and develop. Reading independently is a major goal for the students in my class. To achieve this goal, my students are in need of sight word and reading activities to help them recognize simple words to help them be able to read independently. Having activities readily available in the classroom is essential for allowing the students to learn and grow in different ways.

Meeting our scholars, you would describe them as open-minded inquirers ready to take on new challenges. Our students are here because they choose to take on the challenge of an International Baccalaureate (IB) program that will effectively prepare them for college, a goal they might be the first in their families to achieve. These supplies will allow our scholars to learn without the distraction of needing basic materials. Funding of this project will allow me to better outfit my classroom with needed supplies while ensuring students have what they need to succeed. Students need composition books, pens, and pencils to annotate readings, interpret information, and draft essays that will be important to their success. Basic organization and classroom tools like baskets and an X-ACTO electric pencil sharpener will allow us all to complete our tasks more efficiently. We also need Kleenex tissues, Bounty towels, and Lysol Disinfecting Wipes to keep clean. While students in my classes will be studying government, economics, and psychology, they will be practicing important life skills like research, analysis, interview, and presentation.

My students are 4-5 years old and we sometimes have students that push into our classroom from the self-contained preschool classroom which is across the hall! Our district has been very fortunate to expand from 1/2 day to full day preschool. Our preschool uses a curriculum called 'Creative Curriculum'. This curriculum encourages students' interests and free choice in the classroom. That is why, this year I would like to incorporate students free choice of 'flexible seating' where students can read, journal write, play, and learn how they want. I have included a variety of materials where students can choose how they would like to sit when learning in the classroom or even taking these materials outside the classroom. We need flexible seating in the classroom! For example, students can take a carpet square, a yoga mat, a desk tray, or a sit spot with them when reading a book in the library or outside, when sitting on the carpet and using the environmental print to write in their journals, or however else they would like!

Some of my students come from educational supportive families that help with their homework, read with them, and give them educational experiences. Some come from broken, much less supportive families. These families may just struggle to meet the students' basic needs, with little support towards their education. Many times, school is their refuge, their safe haven. The students that do not have educational support do not do their homework. The majority of their education happens in school. The school then, has the obstacle of providing all of the educational materials needed to meet my students' needs. Right now our classroom has ordinary chairs. They are mismatched and cannot be stacked. They do not work well with my students. I will use this order to slowly replace the seating in our classroom to be more inviting and suitable for my students to make an environment conducive to learning. The students will get great joy out of learning while using these new seating options. They will also meet the needs of students that need more movement during the day, reducing poor behaviors.

I see students who would not 'fit in' in a public school, students who benefit from a small school size, and students who live in an undesirable school district. My third graders are comprised of 29 students, many of whom are from bilingual households and receive free and reduced lunch. With my students facing these challenges, I want to provide them with the best learning environment that I can. I want them to feel safe, loved, listened to, fed, and I want them to know that I am there to help them learn and experience as much as possible. My school offers the basic desk and chair choice for the students. I want to offer my students more flexible seating options, i.e. exercise balls, wobble cushions, inflatable chairs, rocking chairs, and wobble stools. These options will allow my students to be able to choose how they would like to spend the day learning the material. Flexible seating is a very student-centered approach to learning. It gives the students ownership over the classroom and their seating options. More classroom ownership equals more engagement from the students. The donations to this project will empower my students in choosing a seating option that is comfortable for them and is conducive to their learning. Comfortable students equal more engagement in the material. Student empowerment over the choices that they get to make equals more engagement, also. The students' comfort is important to me.

Having taught in other 4K programs, I know first hand how how distracting a circle time rug can be as students will notice a speck of paper or piece of tape and become distracted from a great learning opportunity. I'm requesting one large circle time carpet for my students as their current circle time carpet is severely stained and left with tape residue from years of use. This carpet is where most of our learning will occur such as morning meeting, large group learning, small group literacy and math, and center time blocks. In my classroom, we practice listening and speaking daily using cooperative learning strategies. The addition of a nice clean rug would give my students a much needed boost of practice in the areas of listening and speaking as they will feel less distracted by stains and sticky tape residue and become more engaged in activities that promote their learning. Students who are not distracted learn to self-regulate and engage in their own learning.",My students need a new circle time rug to replace the old worn and stained rug in our classroom.,Applied Learning,Grades PreK-2,Supplies,647.0,Fully Funded

89e294aaacc5936096482e07ea8e98b7,Flexible Seating For Our Future,"Jefferson Elementary is located in the heart of Fargo, ND. We have the opportunity to foster growth and guide students who love to learn. We have a very diverse group of learners. Some of our families have been in the Fargo area for years. However, Jefferson is a school to many new Americans and their families. Our classroom is full of many different languages. There are students who can speak fluent English and those who have only a few words. Those students who do not know the common language not only have to learn conversational English but also academic English. They are very bright young people with joy in their hearts who are excited to be in school. The flexible seating that I am asking for are items that I would not be able to personally give to my students as a first-year teacher. Flexible seating provides a choice to the students and gives them a true 21st century learning environment. Studies have shown that children do not all learn the same and need various sensory inputs to be successful. I believe that with these items my students will provide the appropriate stimulation they need to be successful socially and academically throughout the day. I have chosen five different flexible seating options keeping in mind students I will have this year and for many years to come. Wobble Chairs are a great resource to have in the classroom for busy bodies. First grade is an academically heavy year. As teachers, we guide our children to grow six or more reading levels in Fountas and Pinnell. How can we ask them to sit still? With a Wobble Chair, my students will be more focused on learning because of the subtle movements. The Balance Ball chairs can serve all students by increasing muscle strength in the abdominal region. I have seen Bouncy Bands used in classrooms that help students who have autism focus through a constant sensory input. The Soft Seats allow for comfortable floor seating that can be inviting for many first graders who may not learn best in desks (like myself). Finally, the stacked stools are portable and are great seats to have to promote collaboration anywhere in the classroom. Flexible seating makes a classroom an inviting place where students feel safe, comfortable, and excited to learn. As a teacher in a Title I school, I know it is one way that we can meet the needs of many students before instruction is given. Thank you.","My students need Wobble Chairs, Balance Ball Chairs, Bouncy Bands for Elementary School Chairs, Soft Seats and Plastic Stack Stools to have a choice in where and how they learn in order to be the best they can be.","Literacy & Language, Special Needs",Grades PreK-2,Supplies,834.93,Fully Funded

Many of my students struggle with issues of poverty and access to academic experiences. Fortunately, bilingual education is one of the best ways to close the achievement gap and to break down barriers of racism and socioeconomics!

As a physical education teacher, I strive for my students to be 'well' as a whole, not just physically. I believe learning begins with movement, and I want our staff and students to have a better chance to experience this belief firsthand. That's why I promote incorporating movement as much as possible throughout our students' regular school day at Titusville Middle School. It is essential for students to sit as little as possible throughout their school day in order to reach their maximum academic potential. Over the last three decades, many school districts have eliminated physical education requirements or reduced recess opportunities. This correlates with a tripling of the childhood obesity rate as two out of three kids today don’t get recommended levels of activity. Active learning styles can help reduce childhood obesity: Standing provides clear health benefits as it increases heart rate, maintains insulin effectiveness and burns more calories. Maintaining low-level physical activity—such as standing in the classroom—results in greater student attention. Increased blood circulation and oxygenation leads to alert students. “Standing actually improved attention, on-task behavior, alertness and classroom engagement.”Sustained healthy metabolism leads to better focus, which has a positive effect on test scores. “Children who are more active performed better on standardized tests, and showed greater attention and faster thinking skills than did children who are less active.”Stand-biased desks in classrooms are an effective way of reducing sedentary behavior (prolonged sitting) in a diverse sample of children.",My students need adjustable laptop stands in order to reach their full potential in the traditional classroom setting.,Health & Sports,Grades 6-8,Supplies,1978.32,Fully Funded

This dramatic play center will allow students to learn about community helpers, role play, practice math skills through measuring and counting, problem solve, practice writing through making lists and taking orders, and have meaningful conversations while expanding speaking and listening skills. This center will also help students learn more about cultural diversity and food from around the world. It will give students the materials needed to help them learn through play.

This year I teach freshman world history and two sheltered versions of history for English language learners. Some of my students have just moved to the United States and are beginning to learn English. In my class, my students will learn about the world and other cultures. In my history classes and at our school we engage students in community building restorative justice circles. In these circles we discuss current events, equity, race, and justice. Assumptions and stereotypes are challenged. Tolerance and empathy are promoted. It is essential that success be possible for all students, including those from the bottom of the social scale as well as those in the middle and top. Regular and routine use of restorative justice circles helps create a healthy school community. Circles support individual learning and growth while at the same time supporting a healthy class or school community. I want to engage my students in restorative justice circles to promote social justice, diversity, and acceptance. In my social studies courses (government, economics, and world history) I choose units that promote tolerance.

While our district stresses the importance of writing, and opportunities for writing abound in our curriculum, technology to assist in publishing, adding graphics, and color printing are either scarce or shared between many classes in the building. On many occasions, I have found myself bringing students' work home to print on my color printer or going to a local office supply store to get things printed. With the supplies I've requested, I will be able to set up a dedicated writing center in my classroom. It will allow the students to feel like authors...to be able to use proofing and editing tools, add illustrations, and print their finished work on the spot...and in color, not from a black and white copier! Your help in funding my project would mean a great deal to some wonderful kids who would truly benefit from the motivation provided by an opportunity to publish like a pro!

About 85% percent of students at my school qualify for Free and Reduced Lunch/Meals. Donations to this project will help fund Learning Through Music groups for 15 weeks in our classroom. During Learning Through Music, students will learn academic and arts concepts that are embedded into the music activities (instrument play, singing, finger plays, sensory/relaxation, and movement). The students will also have the opportunity to transfer skills practiced and learned during music group to the classroom as the teacher and special education aides will also participate in the learning. I have welcomed Music Therapists from this organization into my classroom for the past 2 year and I have witnessed the great gains that my students have made in communication skills as well as learning general content knowledge.

These materials make all the difference in my students' learning about the environment around them because it makes them want to learn and even better--not even realize that they're also receiving cross-curricula, standards-based instruction. While learning about communities, we will investigate ant farms and how an ant colony is built by different colony members doing different jobs. This will be impactful in that the students can transfer what they are seeing our little ant colonies doing to what some of the people do in their own community. The students also learn about butterfly life cycles and with the butterfly farm they will get to transform the read alouds and paper-based activities to a real world context as they witness first hand the process of a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. They'll have grubby hands and engaged brains! Brains processing all the weird, funky, fun facts about the various living things serving as the catalyst for schematic development, and an exuberant love for science in their environment.

Despite the many challenges they face, I am looking to keep things relevant and provide my students with meaningful learning experiences that will prepare them for exciting careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math)! Our school has a high minority population, a high proportion of ELL students, and a majority of student who live in poverty--these are the students who are typically underrepresented in STEM careers. That doesn't mean that they aren't bright, talented, and eager to learn. Daily, I see my students engage and deepen their understanding of core science, engineering, and math standards in my class. Daily, I see my students engage in inquiry and critical thinking. They deserve to see themselves as future scientists, engineers, and tinkerers. We live in an area of the country where companies often hire immigrants to fill high-tech jobs because there are not enough young people going into STEM careers. I want to make sure that my amazing students have every opportunity to experience STEM in the classroom so we can reverse this trend. Recently, I attended a conference session where the presenter offered up a basic question: would you rather look at a black and white handout with just text, or an engaging, full-color handout with graphics, pictures, and less text? The answer was obvious, and this has some pretty drastic consequences for our students, many of whom struggle when asked to read instructions on lab handouts. Students who struggle with reading, or are learning English, or who have learning disabilities often can't meaningfully interact with text. This creates a challenge during labs where students need to refer to written instructions. Having a color printer would allow me to redesign our lab handouts so that they would be colorful and immediately engaging to all students. More graphics and less text would also allow our students to have visual cues on the page and find information easier. Finally, research shows that color helps increase memory, engagement, and increases participation--all factors that can improve in any class!

The additional stories, AUGIE AND ME, THREE WONDER STORIES, will enhance WONDER, help children make connections across texts, and highlight acceptance of differences as opposed to bullying and ostracism. The stories enable children to connect literacy and personal experiences in a realistic manner that will support positive change in our lives.

Seventy percent of my school's student body qualifies for free or reduced price lunch. Simply stated, that means that many of my students come from households at or near the poverty line.

As a trained mental health professional I assist with mental health concerns, behavioral concerns, positive behavioral support, academic and classroom support, consultation with teachers, parents and administrators as well as provide individual and group counseling/therapy. My school is a high poverty school in New York City. All of our students receive free lunch. Ninety-seven percent of our student population is Black or Latino; many are first generation Americans. Our students are faced with many challenges inside and outside the classroom. They struggle personally and academically. Thirty percent of our students receive Special Education services. Despite the challenges they face daily, my students are happy and motivated to learn. Working with the children and families has truly been a highlight of my career. A few months ago, I began a personal mindfulness and yoga practice which allowed me a glimpse of the joyful and free person I could be. This joy was a result of my increased ability to be present and respond to my environment, which included my students, parents and co-workers. My sessions became more calm and productive as I learned to really be present for my students. Since then, I’ve tried to facilitate a mindfulness practice for my students, but I would love the opportunity to be trained in how to do this more effectively.I have been accepted to attend teacher training via Breathe For Change. The Breathe For Change values give educators a framework to lead with love in their lives, relationships and communities. Breathe For Change training draws upon the growing body of research linking mind-body wellness practices such as mindfulness and yoga to stress reduction, enhanced executive function, and increased emotional regulation. Executive function, which encompasses working memory and higher order thinking tasks, can be disrupted due to emotional dysregulation. Mindfulness promotes our ability to regulate emotion, which is key to coming back into control when strong emotions arise. In situations where children are stressed or experiencing anxiety, learning is difficult, if not impossible. Participation in this training will allow me the opportunity to earn the RYT 200 certification so I can safely support the social emotional needs of students who might not otherwise have access to mindfulness and yoga.

I want my students to develop a deep love of learning. My school serves almost all low-income students, with many students speaking English as their second language.

However, this requires resources that go beyond my teacher's income. I love my scholars and they deserve the best! One of the most critical academic pieces that I teach my PreK scholars is letter recognition. Children must be able to recognize letters (upper and lower case) as it enables pre-readers to make the connection between words on paper (text) and our verbal communication. Children need to see letters in a variety of contexts to internalize their individual shape, name and sound. All of the materials that I put on my wish list will help me teach my scholars letter recognition in a hands-on and motivating way! The letter tubs will help children see the connection between letters and their individual sounds by seeing different objects that start with the letter. They will be able to touch and play with the objects while repeating the letter name and sound. I also put on my wish list letter cards that the children can use expo markers to practice writing letters and can easily wipe off and begin again. My scholars love play-doh and when I saw the play-doh letter cards I knew that my young scholars would want to practice making letters all day long with these cards and play-doh!

Each and every day they come with excitement to learn and grow. I'm requesting Original Judy Clocks, digital timers, and Time Timers. Students need to learn foundational skills such as telling time to be able to fill out planners and for time management alongside their peers. The students also need Numeracy Building Fraction Fluency and Magnet Beginning Fractions kits. We'll use the Power Practice Pre-Algebra, Algebra Puzzles, and math flash cards to practice mental math. With these types of materials math facts can become automatic and develop foundational skills. Students are able to take materials and work with other students without having a teacher directly with them in a cooperative learning situation at the same time of practicing speaking. These supplies can also be used by EL teachers in different classrooms to reach the needs of our varying student needs. Materials will be able to be passed between classrooms and to be used in future years.

This “magical” carpet will be the focal point of our classroom. It will be where the children can read independently, listen to engaging stories, collaborate with a writing partner, solve math problems, conduct science experiments. The list is endless!!!

Science is everywhere in the world around us, while technology is continuously expanding into most areas of our lives. Engineering is the basic design of roads, dams & bridges, but also tackles the challenges of reaching farther into space and using solar energy. Mathematics is essential for most occupations. By exposing students to STEM learning and giving them opportunities to explore STEM-related concepts, they will hopefully develop a passion for it while they are young that will carry into their adult lives. STEM education creates critical thinkers, increases science literacy, and enables the next generation of innovators.STEM activities provide hands-on and minds-on lessons for the student.

Each student has unique interests and abilities to develop and share, so I want to give them all an opportunity to shine in front of their peers.

In order to see the world through various perspectives, it is imperative to read stories whose authors see the world through different lenses. I am determined to expose my students to a world that is much more vast than their everyday experiences. A wide variety of literature will provide the students with new ways to resolve conflict, embrace diversity, and adapt a new perspective of the world around them.

These small humans are amazing, and despite the climate of America right now, they always come to school with smiles and stories to share. They are proud of where they come from and they know that learning is a way to do something important and help others. My classroom is 100% students of color, and a lot of our books don't have characters of color. Books are expensive, and really important in 1st grade! It's important for students of color to be able to see characters that look like them, especially in books about important people doing amazing things. Being able to be inspired and have the courage to grow up and change the world has to start somewhere; and I hope it can start in my first grade classroom.

There are six different languages spoken in the classroom. More than half of my students' parents need an interpreter to communicate with me. Most of my students are receive free or reduced-price lunch. We are a trauma-informed school, which means we understand that many of our students come to school with traumatic childhood experiences, and we do whatever we can allow them to be kids at school. Regardless of our adversities and situations, what makes us laugh is Elephant and Piggie! We love the simple and humorous Piggie and Elephant series. We have read, 'I Got a New Toy' and 'I’m Invited to a Party' over and over again, yet it is still so funny! Story time is brings all of us together on the rug to just laugh off our worries and be silly. Students will read if they find books that interest them. Since I introduced these books to them, my students have been looking for them in our small, outdated library. Many times, these books are not available to them because other students also love the books. These fun and easy-to-read books will build reading confidence in many of my low readers. They will enjoy them over and over again. The copies that I have in my room are well-loved. As a reading teacher, I know that these books will help my students love reading.

We are a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse school. Our demographic breakdown is about 30% African American, 30% Asian/Pacific Islander, 25% Caucasian, and 15% Hispanic. Our free and reduced price lunch students make up 78% of our total population, with another 24% of students receiving Special Education services, and 31% being Multi-Language Learners. My students come from backgrounds as diverse as their demographics: single-parent households, lower-income, homeless, abuse, mental health issues, and others come with very little trauma to face. Honestly, many of my students struggle, some with previously mentioned issues, many with academics. I am grateful to be able to share this time with them and to support their growth and independence. Together, we work together to learn, play, grow, and create a community of hope and respect in the classroom. Our school has had overenrollment by 89 students, which is excellent, yet challenging. As a result, we are short on space, materials and resources. Moving forward, we are focusing on a collaborative learning environment that is inclusive, positive, respectful and engaging for all students. Having stacking stools in class will take up little space and have an immense impact on how students will come together to be a team. It would have great impact on how they will work with each other. The card stock allows me to provide materials needed for students to complete their projects, themes, and cycles without having to ask their parents for them. The decks of cards are not just cards, they will become math activities that teach teamwork, group work and math concepts such as integers and number sense.","My students need stacking stools to work in a small groups, bright white card stock for themes and cycles, and decks of cards for math activities.","Math & Science, Special Needs",Grades 6-8,Flexible Seating,192.98,Fully Funded

We provide special education, academic intervention, Title I, and ESL services. As a fifth grade educator, I have observed many success stories of students who challenge themselves, raising their expectations to higher levels, take on more responsibility, and become independent students. My goal is to prepare my students for middle school, leaving them with a passion, excitement for learning, and confidence. My diverse fifth grade classroom molds together 28 unique students, many of who come from bilingual households and receive free and reduced-price breakfast and lunch. My students come to school every day eager to learn and put their trust in me. Every student has a unique learning ability, and I want to give each individual the best learning experience by adapting my lessons to meet their individual needs. Incorporating engaging resources and hands-on manipulatives allows my students to work through self-discovery, ultimately leading to abstract reasoning. This educational philosophy, I believe, will promote not only good decision-making in the classroom, but also establish a fundamental lifelong skill. The fifth grade is in need of funding for a field trip to Camp St. Croix. This project would help cover a portion of camp fees for 84 students and 12 adult chaperones. Another fifth grade teacher has already submitted a portion of our funding. Our students attended Camp St. Croix in fourth grade for a day field trip to help build community and teamwork within their classrooms. As a scaffold to last year’s field trip, the fifth grade will be going back to Camp St. Croix for an overnight stay. This will be the first time away from their families overnight for many of our students. Camp St Croix would truly be a once in a lifetime experience as many of our students would not be able to provide the funds given their financial status. Camp St. Croix would truly be a once in a lifetime experience as many of our students would not be able to provide the funds given their financial status. Throughout the trip, students will learn about the diverse wildlife and ecosystems at Camp St. Croix. They will participate in hands-on nature lessons and will be engaged in activities to strengthen teamwork in small and large groups. The field trip will also integrate part of the 5th grade science state standards as the students will also be learning about erosion and renewable and non-renewable energy found in Minnesota. The educational benefits of this experience are endless. Research shows that sound field trip experiences have a highly positive impact on students' science learning. Camp St. Croix would be a lifelong memory for our students as well as open students' eyes both to possibilities in environmental science and their influence on the environment.","My students need funds to help support them to go on a two day field trip to learn environmental science standards, learn to work collaboratively, and experience staying in a cabin overnight with peers.","Applied Learning, Math & Science",Grades 3-5,Trips,512.94,Fully Funded

We have 20 girls (yes, 20 girls) and 8 boys, so the boys are greatly outnumbered, but we are making a great amount of progress this year. At our school, 99% of the students come from socio-economically disadvantaged families. They all have different goals, dreams, desires, and skills; but they all one common hope for this year: to be further along than where they were at the end of last year. It is no secret: in order to succeed in schooling, one must be able to read and comprehend a wide variety of texts. Too often, students do not have access to books that they truly enjoy reading. Instead, they are expected to be glued to a book that they do not have the slightest bit of interest in. This disinterest in reading leads to a lack of motivation across the board, which results in students reading less, as well as putting forth less effort, culminating in lower student achievement. If students do not hold the necessary skills for literacy, then they are in severe danger of falling behind in school. But, if students are reading books that they find compelling, they are more likely to develop both skills and an enjoyment of reading. This is especially true of students from low-income backgrounds: The most successful way to improve the reading achievement of low-income children is to increase their access to print. That is what the purpose of this project is: to get high quality books in the hands of my 28 students. The addition of high quality, popular texts in my classroom will almost certainly increase student enjoyment of reading.

Students are preparing for their IB exams, writing their extended essays, and doing community service. They are busy kids! As an IB teacher, I need to make sure my instruction is tailored to their needs, and that my classroom has the materials needed to help students succeed.I am requesting desk caddies for my students to use. In my classroom, students sit in groups of four to facilitate collaboration. Our class uses interactive notebooks every day, which require the use of scissors and glue. My students also frequently use highlighters, sticky notes, and dry erase markers for assessment activities. Having students get up to retrieve these items each day causes my class to lose valuable instructional time. By using desk caddies, my students will be able to efficiently transition between activities and gain more time for learning. In this project, each group will receive a desk caddy to organize their highlighters, sticky notes, and other tools needed for routine classroom activities.

OWL is a credentialed member of the national network of Expeditionary Learning Schools, which promote rigorous and engaging curriculum; active, inquiry-based pedagogy; and a school culture that demands and fosters compassion, collaboration, and good citizenship. Our curriculum is designed around Learning Expeditions—projects that allow students to investigate issues and affect change in our school, community, and the world. The study of big ideas enables us to weave work across subject areas. Students dive deep into important issues and develop projects with authentic audiences to showcase their learning. Our “small school” learning environment inspires students to go big!Reading for pleasure is one of the most important activities a child can do to improve their literacy skills, especially in a foreign language classroom. If we are serious about my students learning Spanish, they need a chance to read at their own pace with literature at their acquisition level. Not only will they be able to read at their own pace, we will also read together as a class and discuss what we are reading to check comprehension, make connections, and tell parallel stories, all in Spanish! The reading and discussing of novels is a very important development step in the scope and sequence of a beginning level foreign language classroom. Such reading and discussing of a beginning level novel should start in the last third of the first year of study, after many other language building activities that happen throughout the first 2/3 of the year. My students will be ready to read and discuss in Spanish when the time comes. But we need the books. Stephen Krashen, well know linguist, pleasure reading advocate, and researcher of second language acquisition, said, 'We do not just want reading that is interesting, we want reading that is so interesting that the rest of the world disappears.' Yes, we want our students so engaged in what they are reading; analyzing, making connections, re-reading passages, silently asking questions, etc., that the rest of their world disappears.

When they read about the resilience of fellow humans, their empathy increases and their world-view changes. These stories open their eyes to the suffering of people around the world and allow them to build empathy and understanding.

The AVID program offers a structured curriculum that provides opportunities for under-served students to avoid the 'achievement gap' by taking part in coursework that pushes them to reach their fullest potential. These students are full of potential and are voluntarily taking part in the rigorous AVID curriculum with the belief that it will better prepare them to face the challenges of both the 21st century and 21st century college and career readiness. AVID students are bright, young minds focused on developing a strong academic identity and better understanding the pivotal role he/she can have within the community. AVID students have committed themselves to outstanding achievement in all classes and to model respect and citizenship inside and outside of the school. While AVID students are quite diverse in terms of their cultural backgrounds, all of these students share a common desire to reach their fullest potential. The AVID class helps them realize their potential through a support system that helps them to overcome obstacles. The AVID elective class takes students that are likely to fall into the achievement gap and gives them the tools that will help to catapult them into the successful futures they deserve. WICOR strategies provide the framework for the AVID curriculum. Each letter in this acronym comprises one of the tools we commit to teaching the AVID students. The 'O' in the WICOR acronym focuses on the need for organization in order to be successful at anything we aspire to. The AVID elective, therefore, requires students to be highly organized and carry a large binder with them to all of their classes that maintains organization for all of their core academic classes. The AVID binder is often our students' most prized possession, and they are proud to show how hard they have worked to establish, maintain, and commit to organization as a reflection of their commitment to their futures. This binder is the heart of the AVID organizational system and is checked weekly for consistent organization of materials. However, many students struggle to purchase these binders and/or have their binders fall apart from wear and tear.

By supplying students with books and encouraging them to continue to read, I hope that they will see that there are not limits when you truly put your mind to something.

Most are students of color and come from homes where the primary language used is not English. Our school is located in the inner city and many families are low income or at the poverty level. Many of our students have low levels of expressive language (either signed or spoken) and/or delayed social emotional development. Over half of our students have an additional disability. Despite their hearing loss, they all love songs, chants, and exploring musical instruments/toys. While we use music in the classroom, this project will give the students an opportunity to work with teaching artists that are also board certified music therapists and have experience working with children with special needs. Donations to this project will help fund Learning Through Music groups for 15 weeks in our classroom. During Learning Through Music, students will learn academic and art concepts that are embedded into the music activities (instrument play, singing, finger plays, sensory/relaxation, and movement). The students will also have the opportunity to transfer skills practiced and learned during music group to the classroom as the teacher and special education aides will also participate in the learning. In past school years, we have loved to see our students' faces light up when they're told that we're having music today. The sessions with our music teacher are engaging and fun.

Many of my students come from low income families and lack the resources needed to extend their knowledge at home. Despite so many hardships, my students come to school ready to do their best and learn all they can so they can be successful. The flexible seats and math resources I have requested can be used in a variety of ways to ensure that each and every child has their choice on how they want to learn. The class sits together on exercise medicine balls during cooperative learning in both reading and math, and all lessons in content areas such as science, social studies, art, music, and even writing. These flexible seats will allow my class to be student-centered. This will be in a way where they show responsibility for their own work and decision making. Having flexible seating is an important community-building experience that is the center of learning most of the school day. Having such an inviting, well-marked seating arrangement will ensure all students feel they have an equal stake in their daily learning experiences, as well as a comfy place to work as a team to complete task.","My students need exercise balls, emoji pillows, bean bag chair, focus toys, math learning resources to help take charge on how they choose to learn and work in class.","Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Flexible Seating,417.95,Fully Funded
15e8fa645d24bfd3596de7d844990131,My 'Special' Class 'Needs' Resources to Help Them Be Successful ,"My students need a variety of resources to enhance their academic growth as developing learners in the classroom. My Special Education students are full of energy, love, and a hunger for knowledge. Most of their attention spans are very short, so they are constantly moving. Their attention gets drawn away from what they are doing easily, so keeping them working is a challenge. Although these students struggle in Math and Reading, most of them are very eager to learn. They love to stand up and do their work. They are constantly out of their chairs and leaning over table to do their work. Therefore, standing bed desk would be perfect for them to be able to get comfortable while working. As a teacher in a Title I school, my students are faced with several challenges both in and out of the classroom. Despite the many challenges they face, I am looking to make things fun and enjoyable and provide my students with creative and meaningful learning experiences. The materials and supplies I am asking for are 'special' resources for the Special Needs students in my school. Most of these supplies are only needed in the Special Ed room, not a regular classroom. Keeping the students on task and focused is challenging. As a Special Education teacher I get to work one on one with the students. This helps me to be able to assess their needs. Things like the stand up bed desk, timers, pencil grips, noise cancelling headphones, and See-N-Read tools are things I can use with the students who need them. Some of my students have ADHD. It is hard for them to stay still while working. The stand up bed desk, will allow the students to stand will doing their work, they seem to work better if they have the option of sitting or standing. Timers are a great way for them to see how much time they have remaining so they can stay on task. The pencil grips help the students that have problems with fine motor skills. It helps them hold their pencils correctly, so their writing improves. The noise cancelling headphones helps students with ADHD to keep the outside noises from distracting them. The See-N-Read tools will help keep the students focused on what they are reading, one line at a time. It also reduces distractions on the page as the students are reading. It can help increase their reading skills. The dry erase easel is ideal for small group instruction. The students can easily see the easel and even use it to work out their math problems. The easel chart paper is great for making reference charts with definitions or examples of problems to hang up in the classroom for reference.","My students need stand up bed desk, timers, pencil grips, noise cancelling headphones, and See-N-Read tools to help them feel successful in reading, math, and writing.",Special Needs,Grades 3-5,Classroom Basics,908.56,Fully Funded

Our school is a strong ally of our community and is heavily embedded in the community, working diligently to aggressively fight against our odds. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. When we get our students in 9th grade, the majority have not had an art class since they were very young. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school, my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to be extremely empathetic to others, and we pride ourselves on being heavily involved in our community! Many of my students also come from poverty stricken areas and households as we are about 89% free and reduced price lunches. We have been creating original puppets and performing puppet theater for the past 3 years with the help of our community, school and donors like you. This year, we would like to step up our quality of puppet making and set creation into a professional style theater company which allows our students to gain real world experience within theater and puppetry. Going from paper mache to silicone rubber and foam is one of the many ways we intend to bring our high school puppet theatre to the next level.

I graduated from university in 2016. I teach at GJBL Elementary School in Maine. This school has a very diverse student body. The students consist of over 60% English Language Learners and 99% of the students come from low-income families. My students deserve every opportunity to help them become the successful adults I know they will become someday. Many of my students are very behind and are not on level, especially in Literacy. Some of them are more than a grade level behind. Allowing my students a comfortable space to learn in will help them reach the goals they need to meet by the end of the year. Many of my third-grade students come from poverty-stricken homes. For many of them, my classroom is their happy place. It is my goal to provide them with an environment that will motivate them to work harder and push themselves to do their best. Having these materials in my classroom will not only allow my students flexible seating, but it will help improve their focus, engagement, and overall success in my classroom. It is my job to provide them with a comfortable and homey environment to learn in. If my students are comfortable when they are learning, they become even more excited about what they are doing. At the moment, we have 2 crates with cushions on them in our reading area. My students love these two seating options and always want to sit on them when completing work and/or reading. When I see my students using these seats they are fully engaged with their work. You can see them getting lost in their academics and it's an amazing thing to witness. All students should have the opportunity to complete their work in a comfortable/student-centered space. It is a proven fact that movement helps children focus. These materials will immensely help those students who have ADHD as well. The resources to help these students focus in the classroom are scarce at my school. It is my hope that having these materials will enhance their educational experience this year, as well as the rest of my other students.

Our project is two-fold: provide clothing for students with a need; provide leadership training for all students. 'The Exchange' will be a clothing closet for students to access resources and to learn how to manage a program. We will provide a safe place for students to gain access to clothes and hygiene products in order for them to come to school ready to learn - rather than be consumed with embarrassment, or miss school days because they are ill from lack of weather appropriate clothing and footwear - or unprepared to venture outside when winter is upon us. Additionally, 'The Exchange' will be a way for students to give back to their school and community through the student-led management of this resource. We have students who arrive at school with clothes that are too small, too big, inappropriate for their age or for the weather, or saturated with the odor of tobacco or pet urine. Our youth must have these basic needs met to fully engage in learning. Not having clean and presentable clothing is also a barrier to students' social and emotional growth - often experiencing exclusion that is damaging to their self-esteem. These middle grades are an especially vulnerable age for students developing their sense of worthiness and social connections. Seeing themselves as EXCHANGERS - taking a resource and giving their time and talents in return - is a healthy way to develop as a contributing member of society.

Students often struggle understanding the concept of molecular makeup and atomic structure. If students are able to build models of these difficult concepts they will gain a better understanding of these benchmarks. The chemistry kits will allow a hands-on approach that will greatly benefit kinesthetic learners and visual learners alike. Students learn by doing and these kits allow students to create molecular structures and atomic models. The added use of these kits has the ability to create a great cornerstone middle school and high school chemistry. Every year my students create science videos of the benchmarks they learn in seventh grade. The students will be able to use the iPad for these videos and they can video other science demonstrations. Students will be able to peer teach each other by videoing demonstrations and science labs. Students will also help out their classmates by videoing important classroom lessons for future reference. All of these videos can be added to our Google classroom to be used as learning aids. The added technology will also be used for research in the classroom. Students will be able to have a reference aid right at their fingertips for research on science topics we cover throughout the year.","My students need concrete examples of abstract science concepts such as atomic and molecular models, plus an iPad and case to aid in research and video.",Math & Science,Grades 6-8,Computers & Tablets,765.99,Fully Funded

Students will spend the year focused on math and science, a topic that is both enchanting and challenging to them. They are excited to explore the world of multiplication and division, as well as the complexities of the scientific method. Best of all, they take pride in their efforts and are willing to challenge their minds for the sake of learning. While 100% of the school qualifies for food assistance and 98% are minority scholars, they are working hard to overcome their circumstances and get college ready. This year has been rough as I try to make multiplication and division sound interesting and connected to my student's lives. I've had some success with posters, physical manipulatives, and other visual aids, but it hasn't been enough. Being able to project my daily lessons onto the front board would change my lessons dramatically. Differentiation is always a necessary challenge in a classroom. Being able to project math word problems on a board would not only serve visual learners, but would connect the class as we explore continually complex mathematical concepts. Knowing that my students and I were all following along on the same material would connect us and, I think, allow my students to be more free connections for themselves.

My students come from a wide range of different cultures, backgrounds, and even different languages. Regardless of what language they speak at home, music is a language in which everyone can communicate and share. 'Music is the universal language of mankind.' Henry Wadsworth Longfellow could not have put it more accurately. Music allows me to communicate with all students. It does not matter what language they speak, what culture they are from, if they have a disability, etc. Music speaks to all, and through music, I can speak to all. The Orff-Schulwerk approach (or Orff approach) is a philosophy of teaching music. It is designed around what kids do best: play. In an Orff classroom, children move, sing, dramatize, play instruments, and more. This developmental approach to teaching music encourages students to explore, collaborate, and express themselves through music. The Orff approach helps students find the joy in performing, without feeling judged by their classmates or their teacher. Everyone is treated as equals, even in regards to solos. This encourages the students to enjoy making music alone and in groups. In order for me to become a certified Orff teacher, I have to take a two week long course during the summer. There are three levels of certification, and I will be doing my first level.

While breakfast is available free of charge to every student at my school, many are unwilling or unable to take advantage. Dietary needs, picky eating, arriving late due to bus and traffic mishaps... It just isn't possible for all of them to get school breakfast. Additionally, school starts at 8:40 and lunch isn't until 12:20, which is a long time to go without eating when you're ten! The P.E. coaches sell healthy snacks like the ones I've requested during morning recess, but not every family has the funds to send their kids to school with a little pocket money. Learning should be challenging, but it should also be rewarding and achievable, and it's tough to focus on equivalent fractions or complex nonfiction when your stomach is growling. Sometimes all a kid needs is a granola bar in order to get back into the game. It's much easier to focus on your teacher's instructions or your group members' ideas when you're well-nourished.

Another tool I am eager to implement in my classroom is Math Tool Boxes. In my math block I encourage my students to solve problems in multiple ways. Each individual child has a unique thinking and problem solving process. The math tool boxes I plan to build will contain a variety of manipulatives such as counters, tens frames, snap cubes, number lines, number bond mats and much more. The pencil boxes will be use to house all of these materials and allow the students to have the freedom to chose the math manipulatives that will work for them to solve various problems. This will foster their mathematical thinking and allow them to explore math concepts instead of learning a one size fits all process to solving problems.

As English Learners from diverse cultural backgrounds, they bring a wealth of experiences and learning to our school that I try to tap into on a daily basis. One highly engaging approach is the use of culturally relevant texts that appeal to their interests and mirror their experiences...yet I have no budget with which to purchase these books. My students identify as Somali, Hmong, Karen, Muslim, and Latino, to name just a few of their cultural identities that are not commonly reflected in the textbooks found in schools. They are urban kids with ambitions and drive who are not satisfied with the status quo, and they will make a difference in the world. I want to help raise their academic performance by engaging them more fully as readers via books that speak to their lives. Why does having culturally relevant texts matter so much? Imagine being a student of color and one whose family speaks a language other than English...now imagine how powerful it would be if the books your teacher read to you and that were available to you in your school were about people who looked like you...lived in a neighborhood like yours...spoke languages other than English...and was set in a contemporary time? Too often students do not see themselves in the text, and this is critical to academic achievement and self-worth. Current research is crystal clear on the impact of culturally relevant books that provide 'windows' and 'mirrors' for students who might not otherwise engage and focus on a text. I will be able to reach students and connect them with these texts in a way that I cannot with my current book sets. Their reading comprehension will grow, but even more importantly, their interest in reading will expand as well when they see that there are books out there that are meaningful to their lives.","My students need sets of contemporary, culturally relevant books that reflect their diverse experiences and cultures, as well as wobbly chairs to stay active and comfortable as we read and discuss great literature.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Books,500.32,Fully Funded

Our manga collection is one of the most heavily utilized areas of the library collection, but these series are expensive to maintain.

Students have many hands-on opportunities for learning through the Inquiry Zone, hydroponics lab, iPad initiative, and outdoor gardening areas. Our students are active, inquisitive children desperately in need of resources due to multiple years of school district budget cuts. This is the library so we read...a LOT! When younger students come in to the library they head to the reading area and wander around the space, struggling to find the right place to sit. There is nothing to define the seating area, so students often end up sitting too close to the person next to them, inadvertently blocking another person's view, or pick a spot too far away from the reader. We have to take several valuable minutes from the already short library class time to figure out seating so everyone is comfortable. We need a cozy place to read stories together, and for students to cuddle up with a book on their own.

Many of them have had interrupted schooling and need extra help to graduate high school. The National Honors Society would like to start an after school Homework Hub for ELL students. We would like to create a welcoming space that students feel comfortable in to gain language and life skills. Here they can get help with their homework, organizing their schoolwork and get supplies they may lack at home. Often the student that are focused on here are the IB students; we believe that every student at this school deserves an opportunity to learn and thrive in their environment. Having the space would be the perfect opportunity to make our ELL kids feel more involved and to break barriers. This leadership opportunity is not going to only be about myself as an NHS officer, but instead this will allow many different students across the whole honors' society, and even other students who are willing, to hone in their people, communication, and leadership skills which are crucial for their futures. The library is not currently equipped with spaces to meet this need, so we are asking for supplies for a Homework Help Station. After interviewing ELL and content area teachers, we create a list of supplies to help tutor such as unifix cubes and white boards to help with math and science. Students in this demographic also lack schools supplies to complete their assignments such as posters, markers, highlighters and organizational tools.

The students' enthusiasm for school and life is so infectious and makes teaching them a joyful experience. Even after our 1st day of school was pushed backed 2 weeks to due Hurricane Harvey, students came to school each day with huge smiles on their faces and ready to learn. Our school is a Title 1 school, meaning our school has high numbers of children from low-income families. Some of the conditions the children face are high mobility rates, unsafe communities and poor health. The children often fall behind in school and require additional resources to catch up and stay on track. The best way to become a better reader is to read, read, read! My students were struggling reading on grade level at the start of the school year. However they have shown growth of their reading level in the 1st semester of 1st grade. Now that we are entering the 2nd semester we want to keep the momentum going with reading more and more books. The best way to become a better reader is to read the right kind of book. In 1st grade, students are expected to grow 7 levels. The leveled readers will be used in our classroom library for the kids to check out to take home. The leveled readers would be perfect because the books will not be too hard or too easy. They would be just right for them.

While our classroom does have many barred instruments, we are lacking drums. Due to not having enough drums, physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited. My students learn best through singing, movement, speech, creating and performing on instruments so increasing the amount of instruments will increase student learning and understanding.I teach 600 students in grades K-5, and they come to me for 45 minutes once a week. My school is a Title I school in a military town. Military families many times will move away due to orders or deployments, but often return 1 to 3 years later.

Students learn through exploration and creating. Our classroom is lacking in drums, specially world drums to allow for students to explore, learn and create. Tubano drums are similar in tone to both an African Kpanlogo drum and a Conga drum. All of which my students have not had access to playing. Having these drums would open up the ability to teach and for the students to learn about the music and culture of areas that have been missing from our classroom: Latin America and Africa.

Last week, I found myself saying, “When your desks are touching the wall, you know you’ve gone too far!” My classroom is filled with first grade students who are energetic, enthusiastic, and eager to learn! Currently, students are seated at desks, which are old, wobbly, and difficult to keep organized. No matter how hard we try, throughout the school day, the desks seem to shift across the classroom. This results in our community supplies and math manipulatives falling off of the desk! There is not enough space to do most projects, and the students are not able to effectively work as a team.

Our 1st grade students are eager and thoughtful learners- ready with the foundation they gained in kindergarten to fully launch into becoming readers, writers, mathematicians, and scientists. They have gracious hearts, resilient spirits, and limitless curiosities. We are lucky to be their 1st grade teachers. Our neighborhood is known to be one of the most diverse in the country and every classroom in our school reflects that gift. In addition to the richness that such diversity brings, we also recognize that different opportunities and experiences in early childhood can create inequitable beginnings for children in school. As a school community, we know without a doubt that all of our students are highly capable and work with determination to ensure that every student has the resources, instruction, and support necessary to achieve success. First grade is a time of tremendous growth for students. They launch from the building blocks of kindergarten to delve further into more complex thinking. In reading, they move from working with the alphabet and decoding words to making meaning of texts by making connections, comparing and contrasting characters, making inferences, and more. In math, they move from working on counting and using models like fingers and drawings to add and subtract to using a variety of strategies to mentally solve problems with greater and greater quantities. This rigorous work demands fluency both in reading words and in math facts. Our first grade classes use various computer programs to help our students develop this fluency. Of the 12 computers that are shared among our 3 first grade classrooms, half don't have usable headphones. Many of the headphones are low-quality- with only one side still emitting sound. Others are missing the foam cushioning or are even taped together. The remaining are adult-sized, so go past the ears of our first graders and frequently slip off of their heads. The 10 headphones donated from this project will replace our old, broken, ill-fitted pairs so that students can productively engage in their learning without being interrupted with headphone issues. By successfully focusing on developing their reading and math fluency, our students can better tackle the complex work of making meaning and problem solving in first grade and beyond!","My students need 10 pairs of high-quality, child-sized headphones to share among our 3 first grade classrooms.","Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Instructional Technology,210.39,Fully Funded

Their parents don't speak English which makes it difficult to communicate with them or have home support. The students receive free breakfast and lunch. I have students who live in shelters and others that come from broken homes. They have seen more things than I could have imagined at their age. I realize that no matter what their lives are like at home, my students always feel safe at school. They are eager to learn but lack the supplies that would further enhance their learning. I am very passionate about my job. I would like to provide more for my students; however, we have limited supplies. I purchase many supplies out of my own pocket, but this becomes expensive. Most of my students come to school improperly dressed for the weather or without needed school supplies. It would be great to have some assistance for my classroom to give the students a better education. These Chromebooks will enable my students to use technology to enhance their learning. They need to be familiar with 21st century skills. We will be using the Chromebooks on a daily basis for both math and reading skills. We use softschools.com, starfall.com and razkids.com as well as youtube video to help us learn key materials to help us learn the necessary information to grow. My students will be able to access educational websites that will help them become better readers, mathematicians, and scientists. Being in a high poverty school district with a large number of ESL and ELL students, many of them do not have access to technology outside of school.I want to create challenging and fun learning experiences to build on their skills. As a teacher in a low income, high poverty area many of my students are faced with multiple challenges both inside and outside the classroom. Technology is a great way to foster learning goals at a higher level. It allows them access to technology which they do not all have access to in their homes. Many families are just making ends meet and having a computer at home is not a priority.

The students are highly motivated to learn but they have a wide range of learning needs. This school year, I worked primarily with small groups of 5th grade learners from El Salvador, Thailand, Sudan, Mexico, Ethiopia, Somalia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. My students need assistance in developing their phonics and decoding skills and this project is in hopes to do just that. My morning meeting groups consists of fifth-grade students who are all new to the country. Many of which, have had little or no exposure of the English language. As educator know, phonics is a foundational skill that students are required to have in order to succeed academically. The books and tools I am requesting will be used during 30 minute 'morning meeting' time that focuses on foundational phonics, decoding, and fluency building skills. Because my students are entering middle school with limited English language exposure, this project essential to their future success. We will work closely with books that focus on sight words.

By discovering creative solutions to problems in art, my students will acquire the skills needed to solve the problems they may face in their every day lives. My goal is to provide my students with the tools they need to 'think outside the box' so they can become competent, successful adults. Students in my school celebrate diversity by studying various ethnic groups and traditions. This year, the entire school will be focusing on the cultures, traditions, and people of Africa. Each of my art classes will be creating and displaying artwork based on a country in Africa. This year, as a culminating project, the students in my school will be performing 'Lion King, Jr.' Your generous donation will help my art students create the scenery and props that will make our play come alive! They will be using the canvas drop cloths and paints to create background scenery and banners. They will also create a giant 'Tree of Life' featured in every scene. They will be using cement as a support base and plastic poultry mesh to create a tree trunk, covered in butcher paper. Dowels will be used to create the supports for leaves, which we will make using green construction paper. Students will also create giant animal puppets, held by the long square dowels. Student artwork will be attached to the walls and ceilings using the double sided tape, creating a jungle atmosphere throughout the school.","My students need art supplies like paint, Drop Cloth Tarps, and Kraft Paper, to create scenery and props for a school-wide production of 'Lion King, Jr.'",Music & The Arts,Grades 6-8,Art Supplies,524.04,Fully Funded

They enjoy the safety of the community we have built. Young children need regular active play to develop and grow properly. Active play strengthens the brain and establishes connections on how to work with others as part of a team. Active play is crucial for one's emotional well-being. With the materials, I have requested my students can learn how to take turns, work together, and learn how to be a good sport.

It is my goal to provide those books so that more reading conversations can take place! If kids don't have adults who are showing them reading, they won't read and this helps. Having multiple students reading the same books gives them a chance to engage with their books in ways that they don't usually get to engage. Kids need engaging material but we need it in multiple students' hands in order to foster conversations about reading. These books will foster conversations about topics in books that kids enjoy and get kids talking about reading and off of their phones. When kids see other kids reading books that are recommended, they ask for those books and this project will make those books available to more kids to get them reading and talking.

I told them to end bullying, they had to help create a more positive, unified and respectful school environment. As a result, we decided to create a friendship club where our motto is, 'Kindness is Cool!' As a result of their passion and desire to be part of the solution not the problem, a kindness movement was born! At the center of the 'Kindness is Cool' movement is the simple belief that kindness builds stronger communities. We also believe that as an action is repeated, a habit is formed. As kindness becomes a habit, peace becomes possible. The Friendship Club is a student-initiated, proactive and positive approach to bullying prevention. This club will improve school climate and increase student engagement. These t-shirts will be given to students who are part of the Friendship Club and who commit to choosing kindness in a world where they are confronted by many unkind experiences.

Many of these students live challenging lives at such a young age. Some do not know where their next meal may come from or where they may be staying on any given night. No matter what their lives may bring, they ALL need to learn from hands-on activities that focus on team building, communication, working with younger students, responsibility, collaboration, and cooperation. Our focus in building upon 21 Century Skills. These skills will take them away from their deficits and make them successful in life in the 'real world.' Students have worked all year on leadership skills that can be applied out in the real world. This trip will give them an opportunity to use those skills in a real-life setting. Activities will involve 1. Scavenger hunt, being tied together (forcing students to work together for a common goal (this always brings out the true leaders) 2. Working in small groups building a shelter with limited supplies. 3. Proper fire building and fire safety for cooking their own lunch. Mapping out property (using some math skills) then using their map (learning how to read a map scale) to find their way around. 4. Several cooperative/problem-solving group activities giving students an opportunity work on skills that they will be able to use back in their school setting.

Additionally, the 4-H students partnered with Trees of Acadiana to plant trees all throughout our community and foster preservation and conservation in Louisiana. Finally, these students partnered with local farmers in agribusiness to promote and sell locally sourced produce and commodities. Due to our students living in poverty with limited resources, they lack exposure outside of their community. Our students have worked so hard to give back to the school and local community and we would like to provide them with some hands-on experiences.

Their situations at home often weighs heavily on them though out the day and they have a hard time focusing on school work. However, some find their niche in our program and they shine. Our students have worked hard on this project and this team of four has earned a place in the final competition. First, they researched and wrote a paper about microgravity and processing food for space. Then they found recipes that they felt could be processed for the International Space Station. After finding these recipes they modified them to meet the strict dietary requirements for Astronauts. After doing this, they conducted a taste test to find the top recipe. The team then competed in the NASA preliminary contest at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, where they received the highest score. They are currently creating a short video of their journey and writing a final paper to submit to NASA. This project has been and continues to be a positive force in their lives. Our DHS Culinary team has made it to the top 10 in the NASA Astronaut Culinary Challenge where they develop food for the Astronauts aboard the International Space Station. They have created a dish taking into account food processing procedures and nutritional requirements so that their dish will meet the standards of the NASA Johnson Space Center Food Lab. This competition is showing these culinary students how research into space isn’t limited to only STEM fields, as well as educating them in researching and presenting their work in a professional environment to a NASA team. The winning entree will be processed by the Johnson Space Center Food Lab and sent up to the station for the astronauts to enjoy. I am looking forward to seeing how this incredible experience will make an impact in their lives.

Many of our students receive special services:70% of our students qualify for free or reduced lunch. Almost 30% of our students are English Language Learners. About 10% of students receive Special Education Services. We are comprised of 2 separate schools with different programs: Montessori and Science. Students have many hands-on opportunities for learning through the Inquiry Zone, hydroponics lab, iPad initiative, and outdoor gardening areas. Our students are active, inquisitive children desperately in need of resources due to multiple years of school district budget cuts. My students love reading a lot and need a reading bench.. As a librarian my goal is to encourage them to become lifelong readers. Beyond giving them books that interest them the best thing I can do is to give them space for reading. Our seating right now is less than kid-friendly. My goal is to create a comfortable space where students can just relax with a book they want to read. There is nothing better than curling up with a great book. These benches will give my students the perfect place to peruse picture books and share stories. In addition to providing a comfy space these benches also allow me to highlight different collections of books with the display/storage boxes. I can fill the bench with books to celebrate Black History month in February or Women's history in March. I can feature new books to the library. I can let students pick the book topic and select their favorite titles to get them more involved in the library displays. I can make a reluctant reader bench for those students who just can't find a book no matter how hard I try and pack it full of lego, graphic novels, and nonfiction page turners. The possibilities are endless!

The supplies will be replacing the current brushes; which are falling apart and were of poor quality to begin with. With these high quality art materials, students' will receive the message that they are worthy of the best and their art is worth it. My hope is that students will be motivated to slow down and really appreciate their art. They will also learn how to properly take care of these supplies. My students will use these materials to experiment with art materials and create their own work to express their creativity. They will be able to learn about specific styles of artwork including works by Edgar Degas, who famously used pastels in his collection of work. We'll use watercolor paints with our brushes and paper to create works of art while studying Georgia O'Keeffe.

We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives.I teach math daily and the students will use these materials in small groups to review concepts that they've learned in class. These games and materials such as 4 way Countdown, and the binders which I will fill with fun practice pages, will be very interesting to the children, and will help them gain valuable math skills. My students come with a variety of math skills, and these materials will allow me to differentiate work stations, and give me more time with students who need help in small groups. As a teacher, it is my job to make sure my students are learning everything they need to know. It is also my job as a teacher to make learning fun and meaningful. These games and materials will allow the children to have fun while reviewing taught skills, thus building their number sense and their math knowledge.","My students need dry erase makers and erasers, binders, clipboards, and page protectors.",Math & Science,Grades PreK-2,Classroom Basics,317.32,Live

They will have to earn different amounts of cash for different amounts of time and experiences at the zoo. The times will have a range of 5 minutes to 15 minutes and the experiences will be observing at the zoo, cleaning the zoo, tending to the plants, and feeding our zoo (insects) creatures. With a group of busy first graders, it is important for me to have interesting lessons for them to learn such an important skill, as financial literacy.

The Montessori philosophy encourages students to work at their pace and level while exploring areas in the classroom: Sensorial, Language, Mathematics, Science, Cultural and Practical Life.

Work is not work when you love what you do!“Since the beginning of time, children have not liked to study. They would much rather play, and if you have their interests at heart, you will let them learn while they play; they will find that what they have mastered is child’s play.” – Carl Orff The Orff approach teaches children through experiences in music, speech, and movement. Feelings precede theoretical knowledge. Students develop understandings from discovery. Their early music education often begins with experiencing rhythm through childhood chants and children’s’ rhymes. Children go on to explore music and movement in ways similar to “real life” musicians and dancers. Learning is structured so success is immediate. For example, children might play a steady beat drone on barred instruments to accompany a pentatonic song. These first harmonies echo the traditional instrument drones that historically have accompanied folk songs and tunes from nearly all cultures around the world. While very simple or elemental, these accompaniments are effective. As children accompany a song, improvise a melody, create a dance or work with musical forms, they are engaged in real-life tasks. Through joyful music making, movement and words children learn through child’s play. This professional development will increase my knowledge in this teaching method. It will allow me the skills to implement it in my Magnet Creative Arts School. I believe the students will benefit just as the founder stated, learning through singing, saying, dancing, and playing.

Within this project that will take several weeks to complete, I have created a STEM lesson where my students will be presented with the problem of creating a balloon butterfly that will really fly using baking soda, vinegar and a 2 liter bottle. They will also design a butterfly habitat with a plastic butterfly counter, and a butterfly craft project that will recycle used crayons. The Elmer's 1680 crayon sharpener will be used to make crayon shavings for the craft butterfly activity. The books in this project including, Ultimate Bugopedia, My-Oh My-A Butterfly, National Geographic Caterpillar to Butterfly, as well as other books, will offer real information about caterpillars and other insects, that the students can record in their science journals as they make connections. The Hungry Caterpillar book and the Life Cycle sequencing kit will be used as an attention grabber and wrap up to the project. I know my students will learn so much from project because they will be observing live insects and have a hands-on experience that they cannot get in their daily lives outside of school.

The students here come from a wide range of communities that represent the city the school is located in very well. The school feels very welcoming, I know I felt that the first day I entered the building and many families, visitors, & students say their experience is similar. Our neighborhood community supports our school in many ways from financial to volunteering. Many parents are very involved with their students academic, athletic, and social interests of the school. As a department, we do our best to try and make science come alive by building partnership, offering unique curriculum, and supporting student inquiry. Our school has two lego league teams, composed of 20-26 6th-8th grade students in total each season. The components we are asking for will improve our ability to be equitable with resources and expand solutions. The Lego Education Pneumatic Kits will expand the possibilities when my students are looking to solve their First Lego League Robotics missions. FIRST Lego League requires students to use their STEM skills in robot design and programming. The color sensors, gyro, extra cables, ball/socket, and other components will help with making sure each team is not limited by the resources they can get their hands on.","My students need these LEGO components to improve their STEM skills; like creativity, problem-solving, engineering, and design.","Math & Science, Applied Learning",Grades 6-8,Educational Kits & Games,607.67,Live

Every morning they walk through the door looking forward to the special time we set aside to practice skills through hands-on activities. They love to build, explore, write and create. My students come to me from many different backgrounds - some are ready to learn, and many come to school to be loved. I am always looking for ways to reach all of my students. Some need to be challenged, others need a safe environment and new experiences! Kindergarteners must be engaged! They love the novelty of new center activities, or a captivating new read aloud. I am always looking for new, meaningful activities and strategies to challenge these learners! This conference would be an AMAZING opportunity for professional growth. Since it is kindergarten specific, I would be able to bring back fresh strategies and share with my kindergarten team. Teachers that are excited about teaching create students that are excited about learning! This event provides sessions that would apply to so many aspects of kindergarten learning: Early Literacy, Play-Based Learning, Classroom Environment, and Higher Order Thinking!

My kindergarten class is made up of 26 diverse 5 & 6-year-olds in a southern Arizona urban Title I STEAM (science, technology, engineer, art, math) school. Ninety-nine percent of the students are on the free and reduced lunch program. The student population in my class is composed of English Language Learners (ELLs) of Hispanic, Burmese, Nepalese, Arabic descent, and Africans, many are refugees. The majority of these students are from low-income households, living in neighborhood apartments and trailer parks. Many of them are being raised in single-parent households. My parents have limited or no understanding of robotics to provide their children the opportunity that I can with these programmable robots. Kindergarten is no longer just for social and emotional development. My students spend most of their day doing activities to prepare them to think, problem solve, and succeed in our future world. They're expected to to sit a large part of their day learning academic material, and have little time for active 'exploration' at school and home. It's important that they have classroom opportunities to explore robotics to develop STEM skills to problem solve and make real world connections. Botley The Coding Robot & Action Challenge Accessory Pack will make a difference with my ELL kindergartners because they need engineering technology experiences that their parents are unable to provide for them. I want my students to learn how to use technology to program a Botley. The Botley Robots will provide my students this opportunity. The Botley Robot is developmental appropriate for my kinders because it is perfect for younger students who are just beginning to show an interest in coding and computer science. Botley is the first classroom-appropriate early coding robot to be STEM Approved™ by STEM.org™.. Coding is a complex topic that would be easy to teach with this robot. Botley will teach students the basic functions of robotics, moving to more advance functions as my students’ skills develop. I can incorporate geometry into my students’ coding functions by asking them to draw black lines in squares, rectangle, circles, and triangles for Botley to follow. The Botley’s Action Challenge Accessory Set’s chain-reaction challenges will build problem solving skills and develop social and emotional interactions as students work together to and solve puzzles, build with the set’s falling dominoes, swinging hammer and rotating gate using Code cards. Botley Robots will provide fun and engaging engineering opportunities early in kindergarten that can set my kinders on a path writing code for more complex situations.",My students need 4 Botley The Coding Robot & Action Challenge Accessory Pack to learn how to code a robot that will grow with their age and skills and have fun doing it!,Math & Science,Grades PreK-2,Books,559.01,Fully Funded

The school is a bit spread out and differing building styles but it seems to match the culturally diverse student body of the school. In addition to the cultural diversity over 68% are socioeconomically disadvantaged, over 38% are English language learners, and over 70% of them receives free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch. Despite the hardships that they face, they come to school ready to work hard and eager to learn. My hard working students love to learn through play. My goal is to provide learning materials that are fun and benefit all students. They enjoy working together with classmates, discussing choices and evaluating their next steps. This is the most effective way for them to learn. It is so exciting to watch them learn together and support each other. These students are also incredibly kind, creative, thoughtful, and open to new experiences, everything a little mind should be. They are the most amazing children. They work hard each day to live 'The Maple Way,' which means being kind, safe, and responsible.I have chosen a laminator and laminating supplies to allow me to create activities, word and number cards that will give longevity to these learning materials. My students love to play games and make words or patterns and they learn best this way. I will now be able to make high quality, colorful and fun games and cards that will last for many students to use them for many years. When text materials are laminated the students can write on them with dry erase markers. They love using dry erase markers!! This project will create a fun and motivating way to encourage students with quality learning materials. It will help them stay motivated and work with materials that are fun and challenging.

I teach in a smaller school in which 96% of students receive free and reduced lunch and the majority are ELL. Because we are a smaller school, we often lack funding for learning tools. These students are resilient and come to school every day to learn new things. They work hard and want to learn skills that will help them reach their hopes and dreams for a bright future. These students are also filled with enthusiastic energy. They are kind, friendly, and are excited to be at school. There are currently 23 students in my class. My students come mainly from Thailand, Burma, Somalia, and Mexico. This group of students are inquisitive and love to learn using technology and hands-on activities. We are working on learning skills for their future.  The Spot Dot Rug will give us a place where we can gather comfortably with borders for our own spaces and a way to easily make a circle for meeting and sharing our work. We gather on the rug for lessons in math, reading, writing, social skills, social studies, and much more. This rug will be used many times daily in our gathering place. These students need some guidance in finding their space. This rug will provide that. When students are called to the rug they will know exactly where to go and sit. The rug will provide them the space they need at this age. We sit in a group during instruction and in a circle during our morning meeting. We also use the rug when sharing what we did during that work time.

Most of my class is made up of students that are labeled as 'migrant.' This means that they travel with their families as the crops change throughout the season. These students are always moving and normally spend their afternoons working with their parents and doing their homework alone because their parents do not speak any English. The other half of my students come from broken homes and currently live with one parent who tries their best to juggle life’s responsibilities. My students are overcomers and they WANT to learn. Currently, everyone in our county has free lunch and breakfast due to the overwhelming poverty rates and we receive government-funded snacks as well. Despite the odds, all of my students come to class every day with the determination to beat the cards that they have been dealt. When I work, I want to be comfortable and sometimes it is not at a desk. The same goes for the students that are in my classroom. This Flex-Space floor collaboration bundle will provide the students with a different option than a normal desk. Many students also have attention problems, being able to move and change seating can eliminate the behavior issues that may arise. The Flex-Space bundle will allow students to get on the floor comfortably together as they are collaborating in all subject areas. Students spend MOST of their school day in the classroom so their seating options need to fit their sensory needs. That may be having a chair that allows them to move, a classroom that they can collaborate, and even a spot where they can work in peace. These students are learning that a classroom is not just within the four walls of a classroom. It doesn't have to be a place that is orderly and uncomfortable.

My students are in first grade. We enjoy learning in a nontraditional environment and using technology to explore the world around us. My students are excited and love the opportunity to explore the world around them. They have been learning to work collaboratively and how to find solutions to real-world problems. This project is to teach my students about the importance of taking care of the Earth. In our classroom, we do all we can to help the environment including recycling and reusing. My students always look at things before they put them in the trash and ask if we really need to throw them away. They are the future and if they are empowered to take care of Earth, they will share their knowledge with others. There are three parts to this project that will enhance my student's learning of the importance of being responsible. They might be little, but they have great power. The first part is to help stock our Creation Station area in our classroom. In the Creation Station, students create projects out of materials that would have been thrown away. Currently, students sit in the floor, but wobble stools will allow them to have a place to sit as they reuse materials. We have a bits box where we place all leftover paper from any cutting projects we do in class as well as old magazines and newspapers.

My students enjoy participating in hands on/minds on learning, and we are always looking for ways to make science connect with the world around us. I believe that meaningful, inclusive, and thought-provoking experiences and activities will encourage my students to be both local and global thinkers and citizens. I want to equip my students with valuable life skills, and I want instill in them the drive and passion of being lifelong learners. I love giving my students opportunities to solve problems, and to think outside of the box both literally and figuratively. My students love completing challenges in the classroom, and I think that it is healthy to promote activities that allow for fun competition within the classroom because I believe that this helps students to grow and persevere in all that they do. My students need lock boxes, locks, spy kits, and puzzles for their breakout boxes because these materials will allow them to race against the clock to solve complex science problems that have to do with the periodic table, types of energy, forces and motion, engineering, astronomy, and so much more. The locks, puzzles, and spy kits that I am requesting will allow my students to dive deeper into science concepts by allowing them hands on practice with their problem solving, critical thinking, and collaboration skills. Student groups of 3-4 students will work together to solve the puzzles and to break the codes that will open each of their locks, and each student will bring unique skills to each challenge. Student groups will then combine their 'breakout' findings from each of their lock boxes to solve a larger class challenge that will emphasize science concepts, engineering skills, and ask students to use their higher order thinking skills. These breakout boxes will allow me to differentiate within my classroom by providing a variety of puzzles, mazes, riddles, challenges etc., and they will allow for active participation and an active learning environment. Students will be given the opportunity to 'break out' of their ordinary science routines by exercising their imagination, curiosity, critical thinking skills, and science content knowledge, and hopefully these experiences will stay with them for many years to come. I want to go beyond the expectations of everyday experiences by allowing my students to make real world connections, and by opening their minds to developing their own pathways of learning.
