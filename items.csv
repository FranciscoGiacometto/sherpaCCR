079c3b787c79338e9ae879a752470a2c,Literary Elements Through Picture Books,"Critical thinking skills are at an all time low. My students struggle to understand the deeper meaning behind texts. After doing a little searching, I came across a resource that recommended using picture books to introduce deeper thinking. I did a trial run which was a HUGE success! My students live in a small town. They are wonderful kids that are always full of energy. They always keep me on my toes and I love it. Our school is the newest building in the district, but despite the new walls and floors, we have some very dated reading materials. One of the copyrights on my text books is 1991. Because of the dated images, students often think there is nothing 'good' to be found in the text book which sends me on a quest for newer material to keep their interest levels up. These books that I've requested will help to teach a variety of literary elements in a non-threatening way. Most of the stories are historical fiction which allows me to pair a non-fiction text with the historical fiction story. The idea is to get text-to-text connections between the historical and non-fiction. As a result of high-stakes testing, students have been taught very little History and Science in the past several years. It's a disservice to our students. I hope to remedy at least part of that while incorporating my own subject area (ELA). Donations to this project will make a difference by deepening students' historical knowledge base while developing analytical skills. It will provide students with independent practice that will both challenge them and encourage them to read something out of their comfort zone. ","My students need multiple copies of 8 books, to make text-to-text connections. As a result of standards-based testing, it is a difficult concept for them.

f20e27bbfb6507e596cc6a405589ca93,Engineers Are Designers,"Students need to be creators not consumers in the classroom. Bamboo Pen Tablets will allow my students to produce drawings and diagrams of their ideas digitally then display them on their ePortfolio websites. These devices will be used to construct sketches and plans in our STEM Engineering class. Fewer students in the United States are pursuing careers in engineering. This concerns me because engineers are the designers and innovators in our society. If we want to strengthen our economy we need to invest in our future and inspire students toward careers in engineering design. The new common core Next Generation Science Standards emphasize engineering and design thinking. This is an important shift in education from standardized teaching toward problem based learning. In response, I have created an engineering class which focuses on design thinking and problem solving. It is very exciting for our school, which is in Central California. We are a low income community and many students are disadvantaged financially. Many of my students have never been out of the city. They do not have many opportunities. This year has been the hardest for us. Our district is facing big budget cuts. Our spending has been frozen and reduced, which is why I am seeking funding outside of the school. The new Common Core is inspiring a shift from a focus on 'correct answers' to developing student ideas. Students come to the classroom with an entire belief system in their heads. It's important for teachers to find out what students think, uncover any misconceptions in that thinking, then challenge those misconceptions with activities and projects. An important piece in this strategy is to ask students to create explanations of their thinking. One way students do this is by drawing diagrams and writing about how systems like the carbon cycle work. With Bamboo tablets, students will be able to draw these diagrams on the computer and post them to their ePortfolio websites. Posting their work publicly on the web gives students more accountability for their learning. Also, students will use these devices to do art and 3D CAD design. This will allow us to move away from using paper which is more earth-friendly. And student work will be online for parents and the public to view! Newspapers tell us we have many high tech jobs available in the US but we don't have the skilled employees to fill them. Students do not have the thinking and collaborative skills that industry wants. I've created an elective class to focus students on these skills. We must develop student creativity and innovation if we want inventors and designers which will lead our nation in the world economy. We must give them tools like Bamboo tablets to inspire them to explore their creative talent.

No matter how many times or ways your teacher explained it, it just didn't make sense. My students have encountered this same problem. Learning games provide an engaging way to help those concepts develop and stick. My students live in a small rural area. They attend a small school that is home to PK-5th. Class sizes vary from 15-26 depending on the grade level. Currently they are in a class of 16. They are all eager to learn new things. Like all third graders, they enjoy playing games. They are a very close group who support and encourage each other. Most of them have attended the same school since PK. I am requesting board games to help with difficult concepts in reading. I have found that my students struggle with things like main idea. I chose sets of bingo and literacy games that I could use as a whole class or small group activity to help the students make meaningful and engaging connections to the concepts that they struggle with. I also requested math games and books that will help introduce new topics and give students hands on engagement with the new ideas. I also chose a set of timers to help assist in game play and keeping up with transition times between centers or games. Donations to my request will make a huge impact in my students' day to day learning experiences. I am a first year teacher who has few resources outside of the traditional textbook. These games will make it possible to reach my students who learn in nontraditional ways. It will help them make meaningful connections with the concepts and keep them engaged.

The math manipulative's that I want for my students will provide an excellent opportunity of learning for my students. With Common Core Curriculum being the new testing requirement for our students, hands on opportunities will be a perfect fit for every child. Each student will be able to explore the math concepts on their own and be able to describe how they have come to the answer. By being able to express how they have come to an answer helps them have a greater understanding for the math concept. Also, it fits to every child learning style. All students learn differently so these activities help differentiate instruction and allow for enrichment activities for the students. As an added bonus, the students love hands on activities. This makes them motivated to learn and to love math. They provide positive peer interaction and an overall exciting atmosphere for our students. Please help me provide more opportunities for hands on learning for my students. Education is so important for young learners and they will benefit tremendously from the use of manipulative's.

Our middle school has a specific program called the Target program. The Target program supports students with emotional disorders. Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life.

82dc79b35d3a4f28173c8f84b65cfb9c,Theater: Creating the Jungle Book,"I have the privilege of working with the students of Fruitvale neighborhood here in Oakland. Many of my kiddos were born and raised here in Oakland and unfortunately, most of them come from households that struggle financially. Our school is predominantly students of color and 100% free and reduced lunch. My students' enthusiasm is contagious and their determination is inspiring. They have shown a strong desire to express themselves through the arts and we'd love to provide them with the opportunities to do so. They are such creative individuals who amaze me everyday with their imagination, drive, and excitement for the arts. Their desire to try new experiences is amazing. For the very first time, our school is offering our students the opportunity to participate in the performing arts through the Jungle Book Musical. This amazing experience will allow them to express themselves through a variety of ways that they haven't had before. One such way is through set design. This is where we need your help. I am asking for construction paper and paint to provide our students with the materials necessary to build our Jungle Book set. Currently, they are struggling with imagining what the entire musical will look like. By providing my students with these materials, they will be able to use their imagination and creativity to design their very own musical set. The goal is for our students to be actively involved in every part of the process. We are requesting construction paper to build the actual jungle. This will be used by the students to design their own trees, bushes, and plants. We are also requesting paint for the students to add their own amazing details to our jungle props. Finally, we are requesting face paint for students to wear on the day of their performance. We'd love to make this a possibility for our kiddos. Thank you so much for your support!

5b393bfcaf38593afd617666ec8e7a4d,Writers in the Making,"I teach in a Title I school with a large population of Hispanic students. 100% of my students receive free lunches and come from low-income families. My students come to me with little to no English. They are experiencing learning in a public setting for the first time and sometimes come to class without the skills needed for academic success. Since many of my students do not speak English, they need to build up their communication skills and their vocabulary. My students also are building other communication skills through writing. My pre-k students as well as the second pre-k classroom will benefit from the use of these writing journals. The two classrooms have 40 students who will each receive their very own write and draw journals. My school district is facing a $12 million cut in funding to our schools. With these cuts, our school is unable to purchase the writing journals our students need in order to enhance their learning and their writing skills. Each student will use both the two different types of 'My First Journal' books in both as a writing journal and as a science journal for when we do our STEM time with our students. The students will work in their journals each day to record their findings during STEM time and also in practicing their writing skills.","My students need two class sets of 40+ my first journals, 40+ draw and write journals and 40+ softcover books.","Math & Science, Literacy & Language",Grades PreK-2,Books,512.4,Fully Funded

These little lovelies are so full of life and excitement I love receiving hugs and good mornings when they walk in. Head Start services children with disabilities as well as under privilaged children. 80% or more of our students come from homes that qualify for financial aid of some sort and will qualify for free and reduced lunches upon entering the public school system. They come to us for a little boost in social emotional skills, exposure to literacy and math skills, extra exposure to laguage and speech, and many other things on a daily basis. We love our students dearly and want to provide them with the background knowledge and skills that will help them to succeed in public school and beyond.I teach 3 and 4 year olds in a Head Start. They come to me already behind in many areas of their gross and fine motor, academic, and cognitive developments. The materials requested will expand their experiences in building, counting, 1-1 correspondence, sorting, classifying, and so much more. By using these manipulatives during whole group, small group, and independently; my students will begin to build their number awareness which is a critical foundation for mathematics.

I have many students who are from foster care parents and/or 1 parent families. My students and parents care about their education and we all work together to make their student's education a positive experience. My students love to do hands-on projects and get up moving out of their seats! I want to do more community building activities and want this to become a daily part of our classroom routine. I think when students feel safe, valued, and know that learning can be fun; then, students feel empowered and know they can achieve anything!This rug will make a huge difference for my students as we love to get up out of our seats and do movement activities as well as all sit together to do community building time. My students currently have to sit on really old linoleum tile that is usually not the cleanest in our room. This rug will make it so much easier to get on the floor and do some cool hands-on projects as well allow for a clean and comfortable place for reading! My students become my family during the school year and I want to make them feel safe and have a fun and comfortable area to go for our class to have carpet time! I plan on incorporating community building projects to help foster my relationships with my students so they know that everyone in our class has a purpose and is cared and valued by everyone!!

Most of all they want to learn and do their best. Our students are encouraged to questions, imagine possibilities, work collaboratively, create innovative solutions and always look for ways to improve. We are a STEAM based charter school in Wake Forest, North Carolina. We believe in hands-on, real world, problem-based learning. Students in middle school are given a concept or scenario and are asked to become engineers, using the engineering design process, to tackle the problem with creative solutions, while learning the required Common Core Standards. I love being able to give my students choice in their learning. Giving them the option of choosing which seating style helps them learn best will make them feel motivated and confident to learn all throughout the school day. My students would love having wobble chairs and wobble cushions as an alternative seating method, so they can move around while they are working without distracting their classmates. These have been very popular in my classroom because it allows students the ability to stay engaged in learning while moving and not distracting their peers. Not all students learn the same way, so we cannot expect all students to sit the same way. A comfortable learning environment is crucial to making students feel comfortable in the classroom. My students would benefit greatly from having flexible seating options, and I know it will make a great difference in their learning.

The majority of my students' home language is Spanish and are learning English in school. Everyday they come to school eager to learn and full of questions. This year I am teaching a group of very bright first graders. I would love to challenge this group by doing projects. Many of my students do not have access to computers at home. Doing projects and learning computer skills is very difficult to complete in class with the limited amount of computers my school provides. In a world that relies so much on technology it is important to teach students how to use it. We use it everyday as adults to answer questions we have. Imagine all the questions my students will answer by the use of this technology! By having four laptops in my room students will be able to learn how to type and research their questions. They will be using these laptops during reading and math small groups. Students will be completing projects that they need to research and create presentations that they will share with the class.

We are located in an area where the socioeconomic status of many residents is low. Many students have parents who are out of work. Our school relies heavily on state funding and this year, we are struggling once again due to the state not coming through with that funding. Programs and teachers are being cut and our students are feeling the brunt. Our students are creative and kind and they strive to reach their goals no matter what obstacles they face. They continue to achieve successfully despite more challenges and fewer resources. They forge ahead without complaints. Although funds are low, our students' passion for books hasn't dulled one bit. Please help keep this thirst for literature alive by supporting our school. Strong literacy skills help students excel in every aspect of their personal and professional lives. Providing fresh fiction and nonfiction books in our library will help spark students' interest in reading, thus encouraging them to become strong, lifelong readers. Our educators work harder every year to strengthen our sustained silent reading program and encouraging students to read in their free time. The more resources we have in our library, the more likely the kids will be to embrace this program and not only find something that meets their reading needs, but also helps them embrace being a reader for life.

We serve a very diverse population of students: they come from all over Charleston with varying backgrounds and experiences. Each year the teaching staff is charged with collaborating to produce a project-based learning unit of study where students can immerse themselves in the experience of inquiry and problem solving. This year we are delving into event planning for a sporting event. My team is quite large and our students will produce a mini-World Cup, complete with a half-time Battle Bots show and media production for the event. My specialized group is charged with producing the media that will market the event and for filming the game day. My students have broken into production teams, but now we need the filming equipment to make our project come to life. My students have little to no experience with filming, so this project will literally bring the world of film and media to their fingertips. I've already seen some of their leadership skills take off. I'm excited to offer them the opportunity to use real equipment in an authentic way. My students are ready to film and put into action what we've learned about media production, but we don't have the equipment. We've studied shots and angles, lighting, and make-up. What my students need now is the camera equipment to take their learning to the next level. We're using what we already have in our pockets: iPhones, and we're looking to improve the quality of our shots and video by using equipment specifically made to shoot with the iPhone camera. My students will use the equipment to film professional looking commercials and our sporting event action. I'm requesting a microphone, camera lenses, a gimbal for stability and movement, and a spotlight for effects. My students will have to market our mini-World Cup event, they will have to interview the student coaches, and film the action of our Battle Bots half-time show. We need equipment that will allow my students to film and produce action shots easily and that will capture sound and dialogue to enhance our audio. This media and filming project will bring the film world to life for my students who otherwise have no other opportunity for this experience.

Students will spend the year focused on math and science, a topic that is both enchanting and challenging to them. They are excited to explore the world of multiplication and division, as well as the complexities of the scientific method. Best of all, they take pride in their efforts and are willing to challenge their minds for the sake of learning. While 100% of the school qualifies for food assistance and 98% are minority scholars, they are working hard to overcome their circumstances and get college ready. This year has been rough as I try to make multiplication and division sound interesting and connected to my student's lives. I've had some success with posters, physical manipulatives, and other visual aids, but it hasn't been enough. Being able to project my daily lessons onto the front board would change my lessons dramatically. Differentiation is always a necessary challenge in a classroom. Being able to project math word problems on a board would not only serve visual learners, but would connect the class as we explore continually complex mathematical concepts. Knowing that my students and I were all following along on the same material would connect us and, I think, allow my students to be more free connections for themselves.

8ad40ddc64dcbb3aba031718fd46b957,Yoga Workshop for Teachers,"My students are in the 4th grade and many come from homes where Spanish is the native language. Students have many responsibilities at home that make life hard at times at school. One hundred percent of the students in our school receive free breakfast and lunch. This can sometimes be the only meals students eat. Our school is in a high poverty area and parents work very hard to make ends meet. Students struggle with anger issues and low self-esteem. This has a huge impact on how they learn in class. These issues also affect how students react to others. Many students continue to struggle and have no basic skills on how to cope with their problems. I am an educator at Tulsa Public Schools. I have been teaching for 12 years. My life is my job. I strive to be the best I can be and model this behavior for my students. This past summer I was excited to receive a grant from Donors Choose for yoga mats for an after-school yoga club.I have been working hard on my health and have really felt the advantages of taking yoga. I want to share this with students. So many studies have been done on behavior and how meditation in yoga benefits students. Teaching in a high-poverty school, I see how stress affects students. Having skills to deal with that stress will help so much. Teaching these skills correctly is very important. Breathe for Change is a 200-hour professional development for educators to become yoga instructors and learn how to implement strategies to teach students in school. I am very excited to be accepted for the summer of 2018 workshop. The program costs 2,895 dollars, but I was granted a 1,000 dollar scholarship and 1,200 funded project from Donors Choose. This leaves my balance at $695. Any donations go to Breathe for Change to pay for my tuition. I am traveling out of state to Los Angeles. I have family in California so that will help with lodging expenses. I will be at this workshop for one month. Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated!
