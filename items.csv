Try reading a well-designed comic! And while you're at it, learn how to use quotation marks in your writing!Our city school serves children from all socio-economic levels in its Montessori, Designed Instruction, and regular classrooms. My students all struggle with reading, writing, and mathematics because they have a learning, health, or other disability. They are the best kids in the world, and I love to find ways to make their hard work pay off quicker and in multiple ways. Reading today's Comic-Style books has so many benefits. The words are leveled, the graphics are designed to teach emotional response ('read that with expression' just became easier) and strong story lines show all the elements of a good story. And BONUS! We can use them to understand just what goes into those pesky quotation marks classroom teachers demand third graders to use. With these Comic-style books, my students will also learn how to analyze plot, storyline, and problem/solution. This will make sense as they learn to plan their own writing.I've seen my students learn to read, and many use the stories we've read to provide a basis for their own writing. This is GOOD! Now my classroom needs books that will enable them to do this at a lower level. The TOON books, several of which have won awards, will make that easier.

Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

We learn how to read, write, and do science and math! We learn about different places in the world and celebrate each other's languages and cultures. We are the best we can My five and six-year olds come from a variety of backgrounds. They speak Spanish, English, or both! Sometimes my students speak other languages as well. 80% of my students receive free or reduced-price lunches. My school is a Spanish Immersion school in Minneapolis , so we really celebrate both language and ethnic diversity! As you can see in my photo, my carpet is faded. I currently use one-sided velcro to assign seating. This summer, though, I'm teaching in a classroom that has the rug I'm asking for! The kids LOVE taking turns walking on the numbers while the rest of the class counts out loud. I envision assigning seating by letter, color, etc. to get kids sitting with different peers each day! We could also each sit on a letter and then play ABC games. Students love MOVING to learn, and this rug makes that possible. The learning opportunities are endless!

b9c058d4923f04e9cf4138f3f5960e70,Helping Students Focus and Achieve,"We do all we can to use technology in our curriculum, though many of our students cannot afford a set of headphones. When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

My students and I have decided to do a monthly service project to give to those in need. I want to give back to my class by having this project fully funded this month. I teach 27 fourth graders in a fabulous school. Our mission statement states, 'We are building stronger minds, bodies, and spirits together.' I think this applies to everything we do. Each year our school makes donations to Make-a-Wish, Pennies for Patients, Animal Shelters, Zoos, and many other organizations. We are a hard working, dedicated, and caring community striving to make the world a better place one act of kindness at a time. We know that our actions will ripple throughout the community. Please bring some joy to your life and join us in our efforts! This project would allow us to create sign ups, share our community service pictures, and find more organizations in need. Thus far we have planned, blanket and food donations around the holidays, animal shelter donations, visits to a local nursing home, treats for our local heroes (police, firefighters, military), and care packages overseas. In order to complete all of these tasks, we are going to need this project fully funded. You could be a part of our ripple of kindness. We have requested items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, granola bars, and soap to make care packages to donate to homeless shelters. We have requested pre-made care packages with snacks for our heroes in our local community (police, firefighters, etc) and for our heroes overseas (our American soldiers fighting for our freedoms). We are truly grateful to have the resources to be able to provide these service projects to make our world a better place and bring a smile. There's no better feeling in the world! We believe that bullying doesn't exist when students are working together to better the lives of those around them. Each act of kindness is a small reminder of how we are working as a team to build a stronger community. And we do have to work together for this to succeed.

'Show me, I forget, tell me, I remember, involve me, I understand'~Carl Orff. We are rebuilding a program and starting from ZERO and need ways to INVOLVE our students in music making! My students are K through 6th grade at an inner-city school in Minneapolis with a diverse population including Hispanic, African American, and Somali students. We are an Open School where students are taught to be critical thinkers and give their own voice to each project they embark on. Hard working, enthusiastic, and extremely joyful, they devour all arts opportunities presented to them. They LOVE to create and perform and jump at the chance to share their creations. 'Orff Instruments' (in this project, xylophones) are specifically designed for elementary and middle school use. Students not only use them to learn and accompany known songs and pieces, but more importantly to create their own arrangements, compositions, and solos. They are a fabulously accessible instrument that allows all students to participate in music making. They also help dramatically in differentiation- students and the teacher can tailor learning to the needs of each student by making the music as simple or complex as appropriate. Students will perform large pieces in an ensemble, accompany songs in the classroom, and create their own arrangements and compositions. The general music program at our school is being rebuilt from the ground up- we started the year with an empty room. With extremely limited funds we are not able to purchase these, or many other, instruments and classroom supplies. Ideally, someday we will have one instrument for each student in the class. Contributing to this project will help get us started rebuilding this program and support 500+ kids in an inner city setting!

My resource room pulls students with disabilities from behavior, designed instruction, and regular classrooms. What we do to help students has to be quick, thorough, deep, and practical.

(Bickart, Jablon, & Dodge 1999). This quote shows the importance and value of center/stations in the classroom. My students are excited to learn. They have great attendance and love coming to school! At school they are safe, encouraged, and supported. Sadly, our inner city school has been labeled high priority by our state. Our test scores are just not good enough. We also have over 90% free and reduced lunch and many homeless and highly mobile students. But, my students are eager to succeed in learning and life! To keep my students engaged and excited about learning we do stations. During stations, small groups of students spend time working on a specific skill, like phonics. Twenty minutes later, we rotate to a new station to practice another skill, vocabulary. The same is true for math, students rotate from working on money, to telling time, to using numbers. Stations allow students to practice multiple skills, and work cooperatively with others. Using stations, I am able to meet with smaller groups of students or even one on one to reach students who need extra support in a given area. Stations provide a predictable routine for students, with embedded cooperative learning skills, and academic challenge. My students love stations! They love the easy rotation structure and routine in the classroom. One thing they are missing is a little more fun! The student are kind and act like they don't mind my old dice, or different worksheets, but I know they would love some more engaging activities.

They are passionate about discovering what they don't know and learning more about what they already understand. Please help make this a reality for them! My classroom is comprised entirely of students with severe behavior issues across 3 grade levels. Included in my classroom are a number of students with severe ADHD and other behaviors that have greatly impacted their learning. These students do not respond to traditional pencil and paper learning. I teach in a self-contained classroom, my students come to me from around my district after they have struggled in their home school. The school that I am at has a staggeringly high poverty rate, and my entire room is comprised of high poverty students. Many of my students feel like they have been written off by every adult in their lives. They all desperately desire to learn, though, and are hungry for a chance to read. Throughout their lives they've been made to feel like learning is something that they never will be able to achieve, but they are passionate to prove those naysayers wrong. My hope with this project is to continue using an alternative way to engage my students in learning. Throughout my building, teachers are experimenting with technology as a way to reach some of our most reluctant learners, including students with severe ADHD. We are seeing tremendous success with unique forms of technology that students in our building have no opportunity to see at home. In our room we have 3 NOOKS and they are always being used. Students are always clamoring to use them, and I simply can't keep up with demand. Students who previously refused to read are reading entire novels and novel series. These NOOKS have been game changers for us. The iPad mini will be a great teaching tool to help differentiate learning and continue to get students reading.

Just think how amazing the library will be in the future, with robots and electronics.' -Third Grade Student My students are based in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of Western North Carolina. We are a very small (140 students K-5) and very close knit public school. Grandparents and parents of our current students attended our school. We are steeped in mountain tradition. Three major industries in our area closed down over ten years ago but the families remain loyal to our school and area. We are over 70% below the national poverty level. My students are eager, capable, and willing to try new things but because of our location and the lack of industry in our area, are limited in resources needed to keep them on a level playing field with their peers in more affluent communities. Our 21st century students will be designing and programming all kind of robots from residential service robots to commercial robots in their lifetimes. The hands on learning robotics and technology materials requested here will be made available to all students at Maker Space Centers in the library. These stations will allow students to directly interact with coding and robotics and newer technologies. Our students will learn analytical thinking, critical problem solving, computer programming, math and engineering skills all while being creative. These hands-on STEM materials will be essential to Create, Build, Learn, Explore and Play utilizing the core components of STEM.Our students love anything that they can work 'hands-on' with and that is technology based. Having a place in the library where groups or individuals can collaborate together or work independently is what I hope to accomplish by this Full STEM Ahead project. This will help spur the interest in new technologies and robotics as well as prepare our students for these ever changing 21st Century skills that they will need to ensure a brighter future for their college and career choices.

I work in a Title 1 School that has a wonderful group of dedicated staff believing every child can learn. The majority of students are coming from a financially challenging backgrounds. The students, even though they have challenges at home, are happy to come to school and determined to participate in learning. In today's technology, fast paced, standards-based driven educational world, the demands on students as learners is higher than ever. However, in my particular classroom (and many other classrooms in my building), the students are knowledge hungry and not afraid to struggle to improve their learning. The students in my room need to read a variety of complex texts for multiple purposes. The students also need to find evidence to support their learning. Having the evidence kits will help my students read nonfiction and fiction text while being able to find key details, compare and contrast, summarize,discuss vocabulary and find the theme for multiple grade level texts. During the school day, we will use white boards for multiple reasons and in multiple subject areas. With the white boards the students can practice their work and show their thinking. Students also hold up white boards in whole group lessons so the teacher can get a snapshot of learning and understanding to provide more intense intervention/small group time when needed. Currently, my school does not have a traditional literacy program. As teachers, we are finding our own materials that increase rigor and engagement in the classroom. The materials I chose will be able to increase my instruction with grade level text focusing on the area of strength I would like my students to achieve.

We are housed in a K-12 alternative school in a rural low income community. More than 80% of our school is on free and reduced lunches so we qualify for Community Program which allows all of our students to receive free breakfast and lunch. All the students that have been placed in my classroom are in the Exceptional Children's Program and have many behavioral issues. The students have many diagnosed disorders that include but are not limited to Autism, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Anxiety, Depression etc. They are great kids that have many unique needs. Several times a day we work specifically on social/behavioral skills. These skills are practiced and reinforced throughout the day. The books and games will allow us to have more options for ways to share social and behavioral norms with the students. The games and tablets will help reinforce social skills such as sharing, teamwork, cooperation, patience, learning new skills and learning how to lose, and managing frustrations and disappointments. My students need multiple opportunities to learn and practice in our classroom environment so they can use these skills outside of our classroom. If the students in my class can learn some of the skills from these books and games, they will have a better chance of transitioning back into the regular classroom.

As content grows more demanding for students, I have noticed an increased need from students for more movement. These Hokki stools allow students to stay seated while they rock back and forth (subtle movements) assisting their need to move during those longer necessary periods of teaching time. The Hokki stools will be used for students who struggle with impulsivity and focus. They will be used to support self-regulation to stay focused and complete their learning tasks.

This is a great problem to have, but even after years of generous donations by countless individuals, finding affordable used instruments, and borrowing/trading with other schools, we still don't have enough instruments for every student who wants to be in band. These trumpets would mean three students who can't otherwise afford an instrument will be able to participate in band. These instruments will not only give the students that play them an enriching opportunity to learn the trumpet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing one of these trumpets could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music. This project will bring three trumpets into my classroom and into the hands of students who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford this experience. Please help me create an amazing experience for my students!",My students need trumpets in order to support a growing band program.,Music & The Arts,Grades 3-5,Musical Instruments,465.14,Fully Funded
b91e748754fc8cd1a41d06dd242ccf8a,Quality Tech for Quality Students,"We are a Title 1 school. In my class we have a Somali refugee, 4 students from the Marshall Islands, 2 students with Individual Learning Plans, 4 Native Americans, 1 displaced, 3 African Americans, 17 girls and 10 boys. But those are just numbers. They don't capture who we are or what we do. We are mathematicians, artists, readers, writers, poets, scientists, programmers, and athletes. We build bridges out of nothing but toothpicks and glue and then calculate the efficiency of each toothpicks load capacity. We send weather balloons to the very edge of space to see the world from another perspective. We design our own science experiments because we have questions that we want answers to. This is my class. A wide range of students from all walks of life, who come from all over the world. We celebrate learning. My students are hard working, inspired, and hungry to be the best they can be. However, they often don't have access to quality technology. These students are technology native, they have never known a world that doesn't ave the internet, fast computers, and information readily available. But they lack the hardware to engage with this powerful tool. The iPads provide a texture and richness to how students can engage with content in a contemporary way. The tablets can be used to: learn mathematical concepts, test a scientific hypothesis, research projects, write, read books, and create art. The tablets can be useful tool to help differentiate for a wider variety of student needs. My project will make a difference because, as I said before, these students are the digital natives. Our classrooms are not yet at the level technologically to meet their needs as learners. This grant will help to close that gap just a little bit more.",My students need access to high quality technology to help close the achievement gap.,"Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades 3-5,Computers & Tablets,1319.34,Fully Funded
977faa20837851e39393d5befa9982a9,Family Fun Night,"I am the art/recreational therapist at our school. As a member of an incredible staff, I work to include the benefits of liberal arts into each area of studies for our students. On a daily basis, students come to the art room for art projects that are designed just for their needs. Our student population is pulled from nine school districts in Northwest Indiana (with an average of 100-125 students).We provide a full day of services for students who are physically, emotionally and developmentally challenged. Art is such a great process for our students to express themselves. This year we are hosting a 'Family Fun Night.' Hosting students and their families helps bring a sense of belonging. We will be sharing a meal, dancing and have the main event. BOWL MAKING! Students will help their parents/guardians make two bowls from clay. Students become the instructors during a 3-hour event of artistic expression. Students and staff work hard on a daily basis developing our skills as artists at our school. With this event, the students will be able to show/share with others (parents and siblings) what they work on at school during art class. What an amazing opportunity for this joint adventure to be shared. A piece of art that both students and families will have forever. A follow-up activity will be organized, and the bowls will be used during an ice cream social.

248ef49bca01b6d7dfc71c5ffa1bff0c,Vlogging for Struggling Readers and Creative Minds,"Our 6th through 12th grade students are redefining possible at our charter school in Texas. Many come from low-income families and struggle with a variety of issues before they even walk into the classroom. As a Reading Interventionist and the school’s librarian, I’ve seen all of our students embrace a whatever-it-takes attitude to ensure their personal literary growth. Our students are hard-working, determined individuals with a desire to attend college; many would be the first to do so in their family. Our goal as a school is to provide rigorous curriculum, build meaningful student relationships, and provide experiences outside of the classroom as we prepare them for college and beyond. My students don't yet believe they can fall in love with reading, but I am out to prove them wrong! In my reading intervention class, students are anywhere between 1 - 3 grade levels behind in reading, and also struggle with their academic self-confidence knowing they are not as successful in this area. With this video equipment, students will be given a fun, interactive platform that excites them after finishing a short story, a poem, or a full novel. Students will have an opportunity to vlog about their thoughts from the reading material they dive in, summarize the text, or make connections to previous reads. These vlogs are alternative means to current homework that involves writing book reports. Ultimately, this equipment will also be used to start a vlogging club, piloted by my students and supervised by myself as our school's librarian. ","My students need camcorders, tripods, and video equipment to begin vlogging as alternative homework assignments!","Applied Learning, Literacy & Language",Grades 6-8,Instructional Technology,826.41,Fully Funded

Our school culture of perseverance and hard work provides our large student body with the tools and resources to succeed on a daily basis. All of our students, including students with special needs and ESL, are provided with daily instruction using a variety of hands-on, experiential learning opportunities. In addition to classroom instruction, students are provided with a variety of specialties in physical education, visual arts, technology, and music. As the music teacher, I have witnessed a natural passion and enthusiasm, in all of our students, for creating music. They are always ready and eager to fully engage themselves in daily music education. With your help, we can enhance their music education to help them achieve their personal musical goals and dreams!It is well known that music is extremely beneficial to childhood development. Learning to play an instrument, such as the ukulele, provides students with many benefits, which are applied inside and outside of the music classroom. When students learn to play the ukulele, fine motor and coordination skills are developed as students learn strumming and chord patterns. Students develop and build their listening skills as they tune their own instruments and learn to play a variety of songs. When playing in an ensemble, students work collaboratively and collectively, improving their social and emotional skills on a daily basis. In the music classroom, students will compose their own songs, which provides students multiple opportunities for creativity and risk-taking. In my years teaching music, I have seen how music education, in which students sing and play instruments, provides an outlet for creativity and individuality. I have seen my students grow out of shyness and self-doubt, and have seen them blossom into strong, self-aware, performing artists.

However, many of these students have low self-esteem and don't have much confidence in themselves. Their lives are full of personal struggles and limited to almost no recognization or praise, so when these students come to school, I make it my number one priority to make them feel loved, appreciated, and special when they accomplish positive tasks or obligations. I am requesting small toys, treats, prizes, such as stress balls, writing pens and paper, stress-free coloring books, Yo-Yo, play dough, kids stampers, notebooks, activity books, and other items for my treasure box that will be available schoolwide to all students. I am requesting these items for my treasure box because I am the one person that provides prizes and rewards to the entire school for the students. I provide these prizes, treats, and rewards because many of these students do not get the chance or opportunity to celebrate the small but wonderful accomplishments that they make while in school. These small toys, treats, prizes will make a difference in these students lives by lifting their confidence, making them feel worthy, providing them with opportunities to be recognized for being an important part of their school.","My students need rewards, treats, and small toys to help lift their self-esteem and overall emotional well-being!",Special Needs,Grades 3-5,Educational Kits & Games,794.72,Fully Funded
