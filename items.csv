Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly. Our students deserve a chance to interact with today's technology and they deserve to do so in fast and productive manner.

Their eyes light up with excitement when they are taught about specific authors, genres, readers theaters and are able to debate current issues and topics through reading. My students come from diverse backgrounds and most do not have a libraries at home. I often allow them to take books from our classroom library to ensure they are carrying the love of reading home.

They need a way to organize their books to help them become independent readers by the end of the year. My class of six-year old and seven-year old students live in a close-knit, low-income neighborhood. Many of their parents also attended our school. They love to learn but many face hardships at home; including parents who are incarcerated, one parent homes, and parents who fight often in front of them. Many of my students come to school to escape difficulties at home. School is their bridge to success. I see myself not only as a teacher of content but a role model for what one can achieve through hard work and perseverance. I try to open their minds to what awaits them in the world and what possibilities their futures can hold. Learning to read can be a daunting task. Students need many experiences with reading books and other materials. These durable book holders will allow my students a special place to keep the books they are reading. Now, their books often get pushed into their desks, sometimes damaging the book, or fall out onto the floor. My students love to read so they try to hold onto several books at once. These book holders will allow them to more easily see the books they have chosen and which ones they want to return to our classroom library. They can carry the book holders with them when looking for a cozy place to read. These durable book holders will benefit my current students, as well as all of my future students.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life. They are healthier emotionally and intellectually. When you're a reader, anything is possible. Please help our students realize this.

Our school is also located very close to the Mexican border and many of our students are English Language Learners (ELL); this language barrier often prevents students from being completely successful, both academically and social/emotionally. I have given many of our incoming and returning students new backpacks, school supplies, and clothing over the years. Most of them will not be able to afford a yoga mat for our new YogaCalm program. Since December, I have been teaching the YogaCalm curriculum to my K-6th students inside their individual classrooms. My kiddos cannot afford their own yoga mats and neither can our school's limited school counseling and health budgets. We have been forced to either stick with chairs, use small classroom spaces throughout the room, or use the music room where there is old carpeting. The magical and special element of each student have his or her own mat to use during YogaCalm instruction would be such an amazing, positive sensory addition for our yoga work. Having a mat enhances the unique and individualized experience for the children, and I would be able to introduce dried flowers, scented oils, leaves, stones, and other natural elements into my YogaCalm lessons if the kids had provided mats. Most of my students have never seen a real yoga mat before, so the novelty of getting to use the mats will be super exciting! These students truly deserve to experience the wonderful feeling that comes with using a real yoga mat during yoga instruction.

bc1732462579d380b9a3519398971991,Sitting in Style,"My students face many difficulties both in the classroom and at home. Half of my class is learning English. A majority of them had never been in school until they started in August. Many of their parents are not supporting their learning at home. They have made so much progress. The first month of school was very challenging due to behavior and academic issues. However, as I look back at August and look at their progress, I am so proud of them. My classroom has a tiled floor but I was not provided with any rugs when I moved in. Currently, my students are using an outdoor rug with masking tape squares. The rug constantly slides, is falling apart, and the edges are curled. My students need a rug meant for Kindergarten children to sit on. When my students sit on the taped outdoor rug, it slides from place to place. With this new rug, they can each sit in their own square. This rug will help with classroom management and dismissing students from the rug. I can also pair students for partner activities quickly and easily with this new rug. Without it, it will takes more time to organize students and some still may not know who they need to partner with. With this rug, I will be able to say red pair with orange and green pair with blue. My students will know who their partner is and we will not waste time.",My students need a rug that does not move so easily and gives every child personal space.,"Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Supplies,518.62,Fully Funded

Many of my students are first generation or second generation immigrants. My students love reading and the books they read shape the way they see the world! In first grade children discover what it is to truly understand a book, fall in love with a character, go on an adventure or learn about their favorite nonfiction topic. My students are exploring this new world with eagerness and enthusiasm and reading up a storm. Our classroom library needs more diverse books. The books that come in pre-created sets that are delivered to the school overwhelming feature white characters and white families. Some of our books are very old and out of touch with the times. All children should have an opportunity to see themselves represented in the books they read. Children get excited about characters that they feel they can identify with. The added benefit is that their reading levels improve when they are more excited about their books. All children need to see diversity in books to better understand our world. Adding the books I have selected will help me provide a more diverse selection of books for my children when they come to pick out their books for their book bags each week.

They attend a magnet school, which requires most students to maintain a B average throughout the year. The students are part of Pre-Med, Engineering, Environmental Science, or Computer Technology programs. Our students come from diverse backgrounds of thirty different countries. This makes our school pretty special in so many ways. They all work so hard and are very deserving of this grant. My students are inner city students who have to overcome so many obstacles before they even walk through the doors at school. I hate to see them get here and not be able to focus on anything else because they are hungry. This grant will allow my kids to grab snacks for before and after school if they need it. This way instead of being focused on their growling stomach they can focus on my math lesson. Since we started this at our school I have seen an increase in their grades and actually in their participation in class.

a5e3db9a299114a9c7e9370f7013f8d3,Flexible Seating for First Grade,"My Elementary school has 460 students in grades K-5, including 16 students in the district's Autism Special Day Classes. The interaction of special needs students included in the larger school population promotes a very positive and unique flavor to our neighborhood school. Our children come from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. We are a Title 1 School. Seventy-two percent of our families are of Hispanic backgrounds making for a very diverse and unique school experience. I currently have two students receiving social-emotional support with Americorps peer tutoring and a student with an IEP with modifications for hearing impairment. Our need to focus and learn in an environment that invites flexibility is key in my first grade classroom. Flexible seating offers students an opportunity to sit in a place that works best for them to learn. This way students use choice to stay engaged in their learning. This seating choice provides a comfortable alternative to traditional classroom chairs. I have students who rock and sometimes fall out of their traditional classroom chairs (which are mismatched and damaged). My classroom seating is in desperate need of a 21st Century makeover. Our seating needs to match our collaborative student-centered curriculum. Wobble chairs help improve posture and allow wiggly first grade students a chance to move and learn. The Gaiam Kids Balance Ball Chairs also offer the students an opportunity to choose seating that is comfortable for them. These chairs also improve posture, and the frame that holds the balance balls in place are a more stable option for first grade students. Additionally, I have requested more ergonomically friendly chairs, the Contour School Stack Chairs. These chairs are more of a traditional style seat, but with increased comfort for growing children. Any help is appreciated, thank you for stopping by.","My students need a choice in their classroom seating.

311969880beb909a1bfc9b722ddbf84a,'Block Heads',"I teach in an arts magnet school that has a diverse population of students including low, middle and upper middle class families. Because I teach Transitional Kindergarten, my students come to me from all over our school district and are given a chance to experience Core Curriculum through instruction in visual and performing arts, culinary arts, music, drama, movement, and dance. Their creative, original work is shared all over campus, and each trimester at 'Presentation Nights.' One of the most beautiful elements on our campus is the incorporation of special needs students into our arts programs. Even though my students start school as four-year-olds, they quickly become responsible caring students and are encouraged to be collaborative learners. I am proud of the way my students embrace their classmates with special needs and treat them with respect and dignity. My project, 'Block Heads' is fueled by my belief that, when given interesting resources, students are inspired to problem solve. The simplicity of building blocks provokes the imagination of children. In order to build what they imagine, students have to figure things out, work together, and fail until they succeed. I have watched my students use the few blocks we have to create skyscrapers, airports, race tracks, homes, castles, parking garages, ramps, towers, train stations, and even a zoo! Block building has been a powerful motivator for my bilingual students to learn to communicate with their peers, and it has allowed my special needs students to play successfully alongside their classmates. The most significant work the children do as they play, is learn to share ideas, and collaborate to complete their vision. Even students with limited vocabulary can communicate ideas, and participate in block play. My current wooden block collection is small, so only a small group of children can play with them. I would love to see many small groups using blocks to build toward a common goal. For example, if one group is building an airport, another group might build a parking garage or restaurant that would support the airport. Blocks can compliment any curriculum theme. I believe that vocabulary is a predictor of academic success. If a child can imagine it, build it, and talk about it, later that same child will be able to write about it, and share reasons for his or her own ideas and experiences. I love the statement, 'good writing is good thinking.' It is my belief, that by creating a classroom full of 'Block Heads', my students will think better, and in time, they will be able to write better, calculate better, reason better, and create better. Be a 'Block Head'.","My students need good old fashioned wooden building blocks to build vocabulary and foster cooperation, collaboration and creativity.",Math & Science,Grades PreK-2,Supplies,554.69,Fully Funded

Last year, I taught first grade and in the fall, I will be teaching Kindergarten. (The photo I have posted is from last year's class, as I have not met my class for next year yet.) My students are Kindergarteners. For some it will be their first experience with school, and I am looking forward to creating a warm and nurturing learning community for them! They will be 4 and 5 year-olds. They will be a community of curious, energetic, individual and unique children eager to make friends and learn new things! I'm so excited to meet my students in the fall!These wooden blocks will be a part of a play center in our classroom. Building with wooden blocks helps children develop fine motor skills, learn to be creative, problem-solve, work with others and nurtures a multitude of other skills! Play centers are also important for oral-language building skills, for instance, when children present their creations to the class and/or ask and answer questions about them.I believe play is very important for a Kindergartener's healthy holistic development. After recently reading the book Purposeful Play by Kristine Mraz, I learned about how all the different types of play are important for children in different ways.

We are located in an area where the socioeconomic status of many residents is low. Many students have parents who are out of work. Our school relies heavily on state funding and this year, we are struggling once again due to the state not coming through with that funding. Programs and teachers are being cut and our students are feeling the brunt. Our students are creative and kind and they strive to reach their goals no matter what obstacles they face. They continue to achieve successfully despite more challenges and fewer resources. They forge ahead without complaints. Although funds are low, our students' passion for books hasn't dulled one bit. Please help keep this thirst for literature alive by supporting our school. Strong literacy skills help students excel in every aspect of their personal and professional lives. Providing fresh fiction and nonfiction books in our library will help spark students' interest in reading, thus encouraging them to become strong, lifelong readers. Our educators work harder every year to strengthen our sustained silent reading program and encouraging students to read in their free time.

Despite the many challenges and differences my students present, I look to give each one of them a high quality learning experience that will set the tone for their later years in school. My students are thinkers and creators. They like to move, they love to read and love lots of positive attention. Many of them are being raised in single parent households and receive a free breakfast and lunch based on their socioeconomic status. These things may hinder them from getting ahead early in life and may not provide them with the life experiences many of us see as 'typical'. From the minute, they walk in the door of my classroom I focus on their social and surrounding learning. I may not be able to control their home lives, however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day. By doing this in a creative and positive way, I am hopeful to inspire even our earliest learners to continue on a path of academic excellence. The books will enhance the library in our classroom. We are a wide range of learners and have limited resources. Having a plethora of books readily available will help us become better readers but more importantly want to read. As an avid reader, I understand the importance of choices in titles and with these books; my students will open their minds and enjoy books. These books will enhance their reading stamina, interest and set the platform for later years in education. The Magic Tree House books will take the students on an imaginative journey into other worlds. This project I have done yearly and my students always love tracking where Jack and Annie go next. The books will enhance their science and social studies knowledge. The leveled reading sets will give my students the opportunity to have fiction and nonfiction books at their disposal so they are ready for any genre.
