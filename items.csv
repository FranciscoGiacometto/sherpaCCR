eb42fca35cf928b28591b40fbd38a588,Workshop Model Works,"In my classroom, I utilize the readers/writers workshop model. It is a teaching model that emphasizes a community of learners, student-centered learning, and differentiation. I teach 4 periods of 9th grade Language Arts and 1 period of 10th grade Language Arts at a diverse, public school. My classes are diverse in every sense of the word. I have students that come from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds. The workshop model works in classes like mine because it makes the learning environment feel safe, the lessons more clear, and the students feeling empowered. The materials that I am requesting are needed to make the students' learning and workshop model more successful. The chart paper allows me to teach students a lesson and then post the lesson on the walls of my classroom, so students can refer back to it if they need help. The folders help students to organize their work and the clipboards help students when they write notes while in the meeting area, away from their desks. I truly believe in this teaching model and I have personally witnessed the benefits of it in the students' success. The donations to this project will help my students become more successful in their learning.

This seems like a simple question, but our place in our city, state, country, and the world is actually a difficult concept for my students--geographically, as well as in historical, social, and political contexts. My school is located in the urban South. Nearly all of the students come from low-income families, which makes us a Title I school, and nearly all are students of color. They are eager, curious children on the brink of adolescence, and they are passionate about issues of social justice, history, and multiculturalism. With these social-studies themed books, I will be able to help open up students to the world around them. Specifically, in fifth grade we study topics throughout US History, such as the Civil War, Civil Rights, immigration, and civics. We don't have a specific block of time in our schedule for social studies, so we will use these picture books not only to become better readers and writers, but to integrate many important social studies concepts into the curriculum. I believe that representing my diverse students' backgrounds in the curriculum is incredibly important. I want to read them books with characters who look like them and come from different countries like them, so that they can learn about the complex roots of American culture. Teaching tolerance towards and acceptance of diversity is implicit in my goals of helping students grow up to be good citizens, and to be able to answer that question, 'Where do you live?'

I strive to provide my students with authentic, rigorous, and relevant experiences, with industry-accurate scenarios, to creatively solve problems, while gaining skills in financial literacy, teamwork, digital citizenship, communication, collaboration, critical-thinking, and creativity. While all my students receive federally funded school lunch, they are hard workers, who strive to do their best each day. My classroom is a student-centered learning environment. I set high expectations for my students, and most of them meet or exceed my expectations. I teach an amazing group of creative, innovative, and diverse future engineers. The vast majority of my students are from low socio-economic backgrounds. As they learn principles of financial literacy, it is my hope that they will share these with their families, and brighten not only their futures, but that of their entire family. I’ve heard it said, “If it’s not written, it didn’t happen”. I am not certain of just how accurate that statement is; however, I am certain that my students put forth so much effort, and produce great digital products, for their financial literacy projects. It’s a shame when we cannot print and display these for all to see. Being able to take home a printed copy of their budgets, charts, and other documents, to showcase their understanding of financial literacy, will make this project come alive, for my students’ families. Just imagine the sense of pride, ownership, and accomplishment my students will feel, when they take their printouts home to share with their families. For homework, students will teach an adult family member what they have learned, and together, they will describe one way the family can use this information to brighten their financial future. With your help, this will not be just a part of the lesson plan. It will be a part of my students' realities.

92bd7e0b588ec5d1eafae4732276aec2,Digging Deeper: Hands-on Materials for Science and Math,"After three years teaching fifth grade, I've finally found my stride and know what I need to help my students be more successful. My students need more hands-on experiences, particularly with measurement in math and science. My students are curious and engaged learners who love learning with hands-on activities and games. Our school is in a high-poverty area and students often come with deficits in background knowledge, literacy, and real-world experiences. Our students love to come to school every day and take pride in their school and their learning. The most memorable and valuable lessons for them are ones that use real-world activities to connect to their real-life experiences. For example, having measuring cups will help students understand the concept of whole, half, and quarter when we follow recipes in math as a way to cement the concept of fractions. My students struggle to connect math and science to their daily lives--and across the curriculum. I had a student this year ask me why we were doing math during our science block! Measurement is an easy way to make those connections, yet students come to me with a poor understanding of concepts such as fractions, length, weight, and volume. Materials like a balance, scale, measuring cups, and thermometers will help us in our daily math classes and in our physical science units. We learn about weather and heat transfer, so the thermometers will aid in experiments measuring temperature. The scale will give students opportunities to measure the mass of substances before and after an interaction, and better understand the Law of Conservation of Matter. I will use the balance to help students understand the concept of balancing an algebraic equation so they can actually see and feel when you change the quantity on one side, you must adjust the other side to keep the equation balanced. For better or worse, standardized tests are a big part of public education. I know that having these measurement materials will help students dig deeper into math and science content, giving them a more firm understanding and helping them be more successful on tour End-of-Grade tests. Having tangible experiences with measurement will help students connect abstract word problems and science scenarios to their actual experiences in the classroom.

These are just a few words that describe the Academically Talented students I get to work with each day. These students are excited about learning and would love to have the opportunity to take their learning to the next level with a 3D printer. The seed of a 3D printer and a makerspace was planted by last year's Academically Talented teacher. Now, the 8th grade class, in their last year at the middle school, would like to make a 3D printer a reality in the 5th through 8th grade Academically Talented program. Eager to learn, discover, and create, the students are also excited to be able to design, code, print, and ultimately hold their own ideas in their hands. Before even receiving a 3D printer and just by creating this project, the students are learning about planning and marketing. The students began with researching 3D printers in order to determine the best printer to meet their needs. As they develop this project together, they are also working as a team to market and spread the word about this campaign so that it is successful. Once the students have received this 3D printer and filament, so many more opportunities will be open to them. From learning to code and design their own projects and inventions, to the problem-solving, and persistence required to refine their projects, the students will be able to develop the hands-on learning experiences needed to increase their STEM awareness and 21st Century Skills that are so necessary to their future. Our goal is to make our ideas and projects come to life with a 3D printer. The addition of a 3D printer to the Academically Talented program will allow us to actually apply our learning in real ways, rather than just through discussion or writing. This 3D printer is not only for us, but for all of the current and future students in the program. We are leading this project not only for ourselves, but for the younger AT students as well. We are not only researching and typing up this campaign, but we are planning a media campaign within our school and community to create awareness for our project. This project is important to our school and community because it will provide us and the younger Academically Talented students with a multitude of opportunities that were not available before. We will be able to learn about coding and project design as we become the engineers. And while we, the 8th grade class, will be gone in a year, what we have done for the AT program will not.

The are now eager to take these projects to the next level - from simple 3D objects to programmable, functioning robots using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. From the day they started working with the 3D printer, my students have been brainstorming what they can print and make. Printing simple objects has been interesting, but they are eager to tackle more advanced projects and challenges. They have seen fully, functioning robots using 3D printed parts programmed with controllers like Raspberry Pi 2 and the Arduino Uno R3, and decided this was the next step they wanted to take. Through the combination of our existing 3D printer and the programming capabilities of the Arduino Starter Kits, my students will be able to learn and apply their knowledge of coding to real-world situations. They will be able to work cooperatively as a team, designing and printing the parts needed to construct their robots, and then program their robot to complete a task. According to Eric, 'Our project is to expand our engineering skills and our knowledge of electronics customization by obtaining two Arduino Starter Kits and two Raspberry Pi 2 Starter Kits. Combining our 3D printer with these kits, we can create a balanced, electronics driven curriculum that inspires ingenuity and opens minds to the vast world of robotics, programming, and the creation of objects that can change the world.' This project is important not only our class, but also to the classes and students below us. We understand that we will be leaving this school at the end of this year, but we also understand that this project will not only benefit our learning during our last year, but will benefit the younger students in the Academically Talented program. This project will solve the main obstacle we currently face with our 3D printer curriculum.

9d5242ed47e74ed7be00e176999c6be0,Love Trumps Hate: Embracing Our Diversity Through Literature,"My three dozen spunky fifth graders are a diverse group of young scholars with a wide range of interests. They are motivated to succeed and eager to learn about the world around them. Despite the negativity they may hear, my students embrace their diverse backgrounds and see their cultural heritages as strengths. They are eager to learn more about role models and heroes that reflect their backgrounds. We are a title 1 school in eastern Las Vegas. Our classroom welcomes a plethora of different types of learners and embraces all.I am requesting thirty five books that celebrate African American and Latino cultures. I am requesting books that celebrate scientists and female pioneers. I am also requesting books to inspire and empower my diverse student learners. By filling our classroom with books featuring role models from all backgrounds, I want to inspire the next round of scientists, doctors, architects, lawyers, artists, humanitarians, and thinkers. My students are diverse and need literature that celebrates their backgrounds. While the current political climate may send messages of prejudice, my classroom will display the opposite. All my students, regardless of race or cultural background, are accepted and challenged to succeed. Help me fill my library with books that celebrate our differences.",My students need books to represent their backgrounds.,"History & Civics, Literacy & Language",Grades 3-5,Books,535.91,Fully Funded
56e59d0e04215a885372ed812d2e3f27,Balancing the Scales,"My students live in a modern suburban community. However, in terms of classroom supplies, they are used to sharing old, obsolete and sometimes barely functioning equipment. Three biology teachers currently share 6 electronic balances that may or may not function correctly on any given day. This means that lab procedures that should take 20 minutes can sometimes take 40 minutes as students line up to use electronic balances. Many of our students are on a free and reduced cost lunch program (46% of our population), and we have a high proportion of English language learners on our campus (32%). Despite this, our school has a vibrant campus culture with clubs and activities going on during lunch and recess most days. The rallies and athletic events are well-supported and well-attended. It is my belief that our students deserve the same equipment in their science classrooms that other schools in our district routinely receive from parent donations; however, our science programs are often hampered by limited funding. My project does not have the excitement of many others as I am simply asking for the funding to purchase 1 electronic balance. A single electronic balance does not sound like it will make much of a difference but when you have twelve lab groups and one student from each group responsible for collecting data thats 12 students in line. A single functioning electronic balance added to the room can halve that line to 6, if my other two balances are working the lines drop down to 4. Suddenly, the data can be collected in a timely manner during one class period. Suddenly we can move on to the analysis THAT day and not the next and the lesson has momentum and that makes a difference to learning.",My students need an electronic balance to allow them to collect accurate data in their labs in order to collect evidence to make claims,Math & Science,Grades 9-12,Supplies,472.19,Fully Funded

They are in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grade with both boys and girls. We are a title one school with over 60% of our students eligible for school lunch. Most students are not allowed to walk, bike, skateboard, or scooter to school and they lose out on a lot of exercise. Our school has always been able to achieve high fitness scores due to quality instruction and student performance. Mountain biking is an activity that most of my students never get to do due to the urban location of our school. Traffic is too heavy for parents to feel it safe to ride to school but our school has over 50 mountain bikes that our Physical Education students get to ride on campus. We need more helmets as ours are over 10 years old and several have broken so we do not have a class set. Research has shown that physical activity is also a main contributor to students academic success and we support that success through biking on campus. The physically active student will have better motivation and behavior in the classroom and biking on campus using these helmets will hep them succeeds as students.",My students need bicycle helmets to replace broken helmets for our 'Mountain Biking' unit.

They enjoy taking walks around the campus, cooking up new recipes and exploring the world through multi sensory activities. It's not the diagnosis that makes these students special; it's their heart and personality that really makes them special. Everyday my students make gains toward being more independent and I love celebrating every milestone. My students are all non-verbal multi sensory learners. They explore their environment through vision, sounds, tactile and oral sensory exploration. Throughout the day I work to make the required curriculum relevant and cognitively appropriate for my students. This has become increasingly difficult for me to do as a first year teacher of students with severe disabilities since I don't have many supplies. These materials will cover a variety of academic and functional skills. During my morning meeting, I will use the calendar supplies to teach patterning, counting, name recognition and eye tracking skills. The musical instruments will help to engage the students and follow along to calendar songs with musical beats. The students will be exposed to common daily words in an engaging manner. This is especially important for my English Language learner students. The academic materials will be used to help the students learn to work independently by doing tasks such as sequencing events and sorting colored bears. They will learn important fine motor skills by using adaptive scissors and use the foam paint to expose themselves new textures and colors.

My students will learn how to play adapted soccer, basketball and bowling with the sports equipment. To help my students maintain attention and stay calm, we use a lot of sensory toys. My students will learn to follow instructions, wait in line, and self soothe themselves. Slinky toys, pop tubes and sensory balls give the students something to fidget with while standing in line to participate in Special Games activities and most importantly, help them cope when they are upset.

They love learning new concepts in science, and they love talking about the world around them. Especially when it comes to issues that hit home with them, from race politics to school lunches. Our school is in a poor urban neighborhood, so students don't have a lot of reading material at home, and internet access is spotty, usually on a tiny cellphone. Most of them don't have the opportunity to take many vacations beyond the borders of our state, so we have to rely on books, magazines and the internet to broaden their understanding of the world. My students spend hours on the internet without necessarily thinking critically about what they read, see, and hear. They have many misconceptions about science and current events, and we are able to use Scholastic News magazine to tackle some of these misconceptions, as well as hone reading comprehension skills. We are requesting a class subscription to Scholastic News. Scholastic News does an excellent job of factual journalism for kids. Having this print resource is invaluable in our fifth grade classroom to keep up with what's really going on in the world. The teacher lesson plans and reading comprehension questions that come along with the magazine provide a standards-aligned starting point. The students love the digital edition and news extras that come with the subscription. The computer will even read the issue aloud, which is essential for my students who cannot read it for themselves.",My students need engaging print reading materials to make meaningful connections to literacy.,Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Books,807.24,Fully Funded

My students have gelled together nicely over their short 3 and a half years of learning together. Although they haven't been in every class together, they have a sense of respect and camaraderie that deserves acknowledgment. With the right attitude in learning and team-building, I know my students will go far in life. They are empathetic, risk-takers, fun-havers, and mistake-makers. They strive to be the best people they can and help each other through the support of their parents, peers, and other people in their life. They are appreciative in all they do and what they receive. They are my bacon bits. My students will see the importance of coding when they see these inanimate bots come to life. For the majority of my students, this will be the first time they code. It will give them an opportunity to seize the love of programming, which opens up doors for the future. My biggest hope is that this will create a sense of challenge that targets every individual human that touches these robots. Let the problem-solving and grit-grinding begin! As my students discover their new-found talents with these robots, I will task them to share their findings with our school community by linking with buddy classes.
