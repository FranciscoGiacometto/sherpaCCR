079c3b787c79338e9ae879a752470a2c,Literary Elements Through Picture Books,"Critical thinking skills are at an all time low. My students struggle to understand the deeper meaning behind texts. After doing a little searching, I came across a resource that recommended using picture books to introduce deeper thinking. I did a trial run which was a HUGE success! My students live in a small town. They are wonderful kids that are always full of energy. They always keep me on my toes and I love it. Our school is the newest building in the district, but despite the new walls and floors, we have some very dated reading materials. One of the copyrights on my text books is 1991. Because of the dated images, students often think there is nothing 'good' to be found in the text book which sends me on a quest for newer material to keep their interest levels up. These books that I've requested will help to teach a variety of literary elements in a non-threatening way. Most of the stories are historical fiction which allows me to pair a non-fiction text with the historical fiction story. The idea is to get text-to-text connections between the historical and non-fiction. As a result of high-stakes testing, students have been taught very little History and Science in the past several years. It's a disservice to our students. I hope to remedy at least part of that while incorporating my own subject area (ELA). Donations to this project will make a difference by deepening students' historical knowledge base while developing analytical skills. It will provide students with independent practice that will both challenge them and encourage them to read something out of their comfort zone. ","My students need multiple copies of 8 books, to make text-to-text connections. As a result of standards-based testing, it is a difficult concept for them.

No matter how many times or ways your teacher explained it, it just didn't make sense. My students have encountered this same problem. Learning games provide an engaging way to help those concepts develop and stick. My students live in a small rural area. They attend a small school that is home to PK-5th. Class sizes vary from 15-26 depending on the grade level. Currently they are in a class of 16. They are all eager to learn new things. Like all third graders, they enjoy playing games. They are a very close group who support and encourage each other. Most of them have attended the same school since PK. I am requesting board games to help with difficult concepts in reading. I have found that my students struggle with things like main idea. I chose sets of bingo and literacy games that I could use as a whole class or small group activity to help the students make meaningful and engaging connections to the concepts that they struggle with. I also requested math games and books that will help introduce new topics and give students hands on engagement with the new ideas. I also chose a set of timers to help assist in game play and keeping up with transition times between centers or games. Donations to my request will make a huge impact in my students' day to day learning experiences. I am a first year teacher who has few resources outside of the traditional textbook. These games will make it possible to reach my students who learn in nontraditional ways. It will help them make meaningful connections with the concepts and keep them engaged. It will also give them educational games to play during rainy recesses.

Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

Although it was filled with graphics and colorful pictures, often it was hard to read and comprehend. With your help, my students won't have to experience frustration reading nonfiction text. I am starting a new adventure with a new district and a new campus! The campus I will be attending is a Title 1 school. This means that most of the students I will be serving will come from low socioeconomic environments that face many challenges. The school serves about 900 students and 85 percent are on free/reduced lunch. We also have a large number of refugees that attend our school. Most of my students face academic challenges due to their backgrounds and home lives. Among these challenges are dyslexia, slow-learners, learning disabilities, and language. However, I will also have students who are on and above grade-level that would benefit from this enrichment. I am determined to meet the needs of ALL my students. For many decades, reading and writing has mostly been composed of make believe; fairytales, talking animals, and magic. Students find themselves addicted to these types of text as well as movies. They rarely run to the nonfiction section of the library. It is important that I teach my students the importance of factual information and how to summarize and decide what's important. Although my students are in 3rd grade I want them to be college ready! Being able to comprehend informational and expository text is a must-have skill for college and for life. The Research and Respond Comprehension center will allow my students to increase their comprehension skills with 3 easy steps: preview, read, and respond. After these steps they are required to respond to follow-up questions that reinforce the content. My students will be exposed to high-interest text that I'm sure they will love to read! Maybe they'll even explore the nonfiction section of the library! Research shows that although students are reading on an average of 25 minutes a day, only 4-5 minutes are allocated to nonfiction. (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010) With your help, I believe we can change how students feel about nonfiction. These products will expose my students to high- interest text that will captivate and get their attention. From reading this genre it will help teach skills that are not only needed in 3rd grade, but throughout life! Thank you for making a difference.

I work in a Title I school where many of my students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. My school does not have the funding to buy many extra materials such as math manipulatives for classrooms, so math time can be a challenge for some of my students. My fourth-graders need concrete, hands on practice with different fraction concepts.

The Common Core State Standards for fourth grade have a strong focus on fractions, including finding equivalence, adding, subtraction, multiplication, and ordering of fractions. These fraction manipulatives will allow my students to easily visualize fraction problems and be more successful at the tasks that they need to accomplish.

Drawing inspiration from the civil rights leaders of the past, my students will use government knowledge and critical analysis to build the social movement of today. Support their path toward increased equality! My students cannot possibly be summed up in words. They are bright, silly, and passionate. You will never be without laughter on any given day in my classroom. These students are full of potential, but have been broken down by the gaps in education and poverty that engulf their Texas community. My kids will most likely get by if they continue on their current path right now. They will find jobs, get married, and have children. But they will not be living up to their potential. For the most part, they will work in blue-collar jobs and will struggle to provide for their families. Many of them will not go to and through college because they will not be able to afford it and will not know how to succeed in an environment with a whole new level of rigor. Again, they will be able to get by on what they have, but they will not be reaching their full potential. But this is not enough.

They will research topics such as homelessness and educational gaps to gain a greater understanding of what is occurring in their communities right now. They will first use the poster board and decorating supplies to present their topics to their friends and family within the neighborhood community. Then, using the Kindle technology, they will create a social media campaign to reach out to outside communities. With the tablets, my students will be able to access websites such as Twitter and Change.org to actively engage in political discourse every day. They will use real time information to create change.

b9c058d4923f04e9cf4138f3f5960e70,Helping Students Focus and Achieve,"We do all we can to use technology in our curriculum, though many of our students cannot afford a set of headphones. When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

'Show me, I forget, tell me, I remember, involve me, I understand'~Carl Orff. We are rebuilding a program and starting from ZERO and need ways to INVOLVE our students in music making! My students are K through 6th grade at an inner-city school in Minneapolis with a diverse population including Hispanic, African American, and Somali students. We are an Open School where students are taught to be critical thinkers and give their own voice to each project they embark on. Hard working, enthusiastic, and extremely joyful, they devour all arts opportunities presented to them. They LOVE to create and perform and jump at the chance to share their creations. 'Orff Instruments' (in this project, xylophones) are specifically designed for elementary and middle school use. Students not only use them to learn and accompany known songs and pieces, but more importantly to create their own arrangements, compositions, and solos. They are a fabulously accessible instrument that allows all students to participate in music making. They also help dramatically in differentiation- students and the teacher can tailor learning to the needs of each student by making the music as simple or complex as appropriate. Students will perform large pieces in an ensemble, accompany songs in the classroom, and create their own arrangements and compositions. The general music program at our school is being rebuilt from the ground up- we started the year with an empty room. With extremely limited funds we are not able to purchase these, or many other, instruments and classroom supplies. Ideally, someday we will have one instrument for each student in the class. Contributing to this project will help get us started rebuilding this program and support 500+ kids in an inner city setting!

(Bickart, Jablon, & Dodge 1999). This quote shows the importance and value of center/stations in the classroom. My students are excited to learn. They have great attendance and love coming to school! At school they are safe, encouraged, and supported. Sadly, our inner city school has been labeled high priority by our state. Our test scores are just not good enough. We also have over 90% free and reduced lunch and many homeless and highly mobile students. But, my students are eager to succeed in learning and life! To keep my students engaged and excited about learning we do stations. During stations, small groups of students spend time working on a specific skill, like phonics. Twenty minutes later, we rotate to a new station to practice another skill, vocabulary. The same is true for math, students rotate from working on money, to telling time, to using numbers. Stations allow students to practice multiple skills, and work cooperatively with others. Using stations, I am able to meet with smaller groups of students or even one on one to reach students who need extra support in a given area. Stations provide a predictable routine for students, with embedded cooperative learning skills, and academic challenge. My students love stations! They love the easy rotation structure and routine in the classroom. One thing they are missing is a little more fun! The student are kind and act like they don't mind my old dice, or different worksheets, but I know they would love some more engaging activities.

My students come to school with a lot of stress in their lives. Their parents send us the best they have and ask us to work with them to help their child become even better. My students are bright and inquisitive. They ask many questions and value quality work. They want to be taught how to be successful and they are working hard on doing that each and every day!

My students are about to start a unit that requires them to learn about plot and how good authors write. I'm requesting quality children's books to use as examples for my students to study. My classes will then transfer what they've learned about the children's books to write their own book. This is the third year that I've done this activity and it's been the single most completed assignment that I do. My students develop their own characters and story line. They create a story for an elementary student that they would like to tell. My students write and illustrate their own children's books. They become authors! Once the books are completed, my students visit the local elementary school and partner with a younger student to share their book. The books are then given to the younger students for their classroom library. This activity builds such confidence in my students and helps them to see that they can make a difference in their world through helping younger students. This project will give my students the confidence to believe that they can do something to help others. This will be another step towards their goal to be successful in 7th grade this year.

Work is not work when you love what you do!“Since the beginning of time, children have not liked to study. They would much rather play, and if you have their interests at heart, you will let them learn while they play; they will find that what they have mastered is child’s play.” – Carl Orff The Orff approach teaches children through experiences in music, speech, and movement. Feelings precede theoretical knowledge. Students develop understandings from discovery. Their early music education often begins with experiencing rhythm through childhood chants and children’s’ rhymes. Children go on to explore music and movement in ways similar to “real life” musicians and dancers. Learning is structured so success is immediate. For example, children might play a steady beat drone on barred instruments to accompany a pentatonic song. These first harmonies echo the traditional instrument drones that historically have accompanied folk songs and tunes from nearly all cultures around the world. While very simple or elemental, these accompaniments are effective. As children accompany a song, improvise a melody, create a dance or work with musical forms, they are engaged in real-life tasks. Through joyful music making, movement and words children learn through child’s play. This professional development will increase my knowledge in this teaching method. It will allow me the skills to implement it in my Magnet Creative Arts School. I believe the students will benefit just as the founder stated, learning through singing, saying, dancing, and playing.
