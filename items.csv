These DNA models help overcome that obstacle. I work at a high needs school in an inner city in Missouri. Our school caters to children whose families are seeking asylum from religious or political persecution in their homeland. I work primarily with English Language Learners and the use of visuals are imperative to teaching them not only science, but English as well. DNA is a type of macromolecule known as a nucleic acid. It is shaped like a twisted double helix and is composed of long strands of alternating sugars and phosphate groups, as well as nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine). DNA controls cellular activity by coding for the production of enzymes and proteins. The information in DNA is not directly converted into proteins, but must first be copied into RNA in a process called transcription. These models allow students to break down complex processes into steps as well as engage the learners through a hands-on approach to science education. Constructing DNA models is a great way to learn about DNA structure, function, and replication. DNA models are representations of the structure of DNA.

Three calculators available for students to check out to complete their homework and prepare for the SAT will help out immeasurably! My students are some of the hardest working in San Diego. They have aspirations to attend college and higher level math classes will help them achieve this goal. Please help my students get calculators to use in their math classes. In our school, our students are: 40% immigrants and refugees, 63% English language learners, 100% eligible for free and reduced lunch, 100% hardworking, resilient, and diligent. The students are in one of the most diverse areas of the United States. Students come from Africa, Vietnam, Mexico, Burma, and many other countries. The students stand proud as new Americans and value the opportunity to get an education. Many of these students will be first in their family to attend college, the first to graduate high school, and they are taking Calculus! 120 students are prepared to take Calculus this year. Many of my students have had very little experience using technology, let alone graphing calculators. Imagine being confused in your math class, the teacher describes how it works, but you just can't imagine. Then you punch a few buttons on the calculator and, voila, everything makes sense. Calculators are essential for success in Calculus. Additionally, students will be gaining skills using the graphing calculators that will be important for success when taking the SAT. Calculus is impossible to understand without calculators. Access to this basic technology will dramatically improve success for these young people. Your support will create a new pathway for success for our students. A calculator can make a huge difference in learning.

The leveled readers we have are very short and most of my readers have already read them multiple times. Chapter books, please! My students are becoming excellent readers. I think that may be my favorite part of this job so far, watching them grow. At this point in the year they have shown so much growth! I cannot let them be held back by our selection of books. It is my job to challenge them, and make sure they have all of the necessary materials to do excellent things with their lives. Some of them have never read chapter books before and that accomplishment alone is something that they are proud of. I want them to excel, be proud of their accomplishments and become amazing readers. Please help me do this for them! The titles that I have requested are from some of my favorite book series from when I was a child. Of course, I added some suggestions from my little ones, but most of you will remember reading these books! The Magic School Bus, Henry and Mudge, Amelia Bedelia, these are just a few of the series that are included in this project. Reading can be fun, and it is especially fun when readers get to follow a character through multiple books. I want to share that fun with my students. My students have been so inspired by the donations that we have received so far from DonorsChoose.org. They even wanted to start their own 'giving tree' bulletin board to track the ways that our class can help others because we have been helped so much.

For those of us who have had the opportunity to go to college, it is clear to see the impact made by that experience. Too many of our students do not see themselves in college, and may never decide to try if they are not exposed to a college campus now. My students live in urban Los Angeles. The majority of my students come from low income families. They rarely get opportunities such as this one, to be able to visit a college campus, and to see a live collegiate sporting event. Our students may not even realize that at many colleges, extracurricular activities, such as sporting events can be such a large part of the college experience. We are requesting one bus for 6 hours in order to transport our students to the UCLA 'I'm Going to College' event. We have already secured 50 donated tickets for our students to attend the UCLA Track and Field meet, as well as the college fair and campus tour activities hosted by UCLA during the event. We would like to offer this trip to our students as a reward for their excellent attendance all year. We have held excellent attendance as a major goal for our students this year. Attendance in school is the most important factor that will determine whether students will pass their classes this year, and eventually graduate from High School.

I teach robotics and physics at an all-girl public school with a focus on science. Many students have no concept of careers in science and this is a great way to open their eyes to engineering in an exciting hands-on manner. Students will learn to program small robots using the netbook. This class is a pre-engineering class for young ladies that have some interest in technology. College requirements for technical fields, such as: 'experience in computer programming', and others, are met by taking this class, and using the technology you are helping make available. The robot kits are already in the classroom. We now need the technology (netbook) to use the software, learn and write programs, and communicate with the robots. The students will be tasked with using sensors on their robots, and programming the robots to go through a maze, autonomously, using these sensors. The classroom is divided in eight teams. Students will gain excellent preparation for engineering careers and information technology. This is a great means to boost students' confidence about their success in technical fields.

All year, we have studied the benefits of attending college and the process of getting in. But nothing inspires students like seeing actual colleges in person. If we receive the funding we need, I will take my students on a college trip to Washington, D.C, where we'll visit five colleges representing a wide array of possible experiences (public vs. private, large vs. small, urban vs. suburban vs. rural, etc.). We will spend an entire day at each college - we'll attend an information session, take a campus tour, and visit cultural centers so that my students meet and relate to real college students. My students will have researched each college in advance and prepared a full packet of questions, and they'll take notes throughout the day to ensure that they will fully retain what they learn. During the evenings, we will visit historical and governmental landmarks so that my students can be fully immersed in this amazing city.

I work at a Title 1 School where 70% of our students are free and reduced lunch. They are enthusiastic learners who need the basic fundamentals to succeed in Kindergarten and enrich their love of school. My students are ready for new challenges and enjoy learning. Most of my students have not had the opportunity to work with math manipulative's or played games that facilitate learning. My students come into the school year with little knowledge of what math is, how we use it everyday, and basic number sense. It is my job to get my kindergarten students loving school, so they continue on their path to a higher education. Math can be very frustrating to young students and it is my goal to find games, tools, and resources to encourage students to love math! The resources I have chosen are hands-on, interactive, and promote basic problem solving skills. The use of mathematical stations help each student independently problem solve, work with others to explain their mathematical thinking, and engage the students in game-like centers that promote learning. Puzzles not only promote logical and mathematical reasoning, but also fine motor skills. The writing tablets will help the students write numerals and explain their thinking while developing number formation. The various learning centers will help the students build confidence in explaining their thinking with peers in small groups, and have them show their mathematical knowledge. Students gain information through hands-on learning centers because they are physically manipulating the tools to help them problem solve. Another great advantage is teaching the students how to explain their thinking using math language and build their own oral language among their peers. My students are extremely enthusiastic about math, but it can become frustrating to work through mathematical problems. I need the resources and manipulative's to help my students strengthen their confidence in basic problem solving, explain their thinking, and build their math language. Throughout their education, children must explain their reasoning, and these resources will help students to naturally progress in explaining how they found a solution and how math is important to everyday life!

My classroom is a Tittle 1, Head Start Preschool/Pre-K mixed aged classroom. They started as a rambunctious group excited to do anything in school and have grown into deeper learners these last few months. Now that their love for school and learning is growing, I know I need to set them up for success, especially with their pre-literacy and mathematics skills. Finding a way to foster their excitement for learning as well as their social/emotional growth in a play-based environment is my main job! We have so many children wanting an adult to read books to them, it has become challenging to meet all of the student's needs during this critical learning time. With no listening center currently, the children are frustrated when they cannot read the stories on their own. By giving them a way to listen to books in a more independent way, we can allow each child to grow their love for reading. In addition, children will develop their listening skills, their abilities to follow directions (page turning signals), and their social skills by reading with a friend! Looking at the data for the student population in our area is one of the most disheartening things I can do. But it is also the best reminder of why I am doing what I do each day; setting up my students for the best possible educational future!

Every day I am constantly amazed by their resiliency to obstacles and the extremes they will go to in order to succeed. I know they are on pace to great things. The most heartbreaking part of teaching has come the Monday after ACT Test Saturdays. My students come back and tell me about all the problems they knew how to perform and yet could not because they didn't have the calculators the problems required. Their scores are lower not because they don't know as much as other students but simply because they do not have the resources other students do. Too many of my students have been admitted to fine universities with their admission deferred unless they can get their ACT scores higher. My students have lowered the barrier between themselves and their dreams. Help them make the final jump. Donations to this cause will be used to buy calculators to be used on the ACT.

My students live in a small town. They are wonderful kids that are always full of energy. They always keep me on my toes and I love it. Our school is the newest building in the district, but despite the new walls and floors, we have some very dated reading materials. One of the copyrights on my text books is 1991. Because of the dated images, students often think there is nothing 'good' to be found in the text book which sends me on a quest for newer material to keep their interest levels up. These books that I've requested will help to teach a variety of literary elements in a non-threatening way. Most of the stories are historical fiction which allows me to pair a non-fiction text with the historical fiction story. The idea is to get text-to-text connections between the historical and non-fiction. As a result of high-stakes testing, students have been taught very little History and Science in the past several years. It's a disservice to our students. I hope to remedy at least part of that while incorporating my own subject area (ELA).

This station will include a CD player, set of headphones, junction box and a storage unit to keep things organized (we already have sets of books with corresponding CDs). This listening center will ensure that all 20 students will have access to individual reading instruction, which is critical as they embark on the initial stage of the multi-year process of becoming fluent readers. Exposure to fluent reading on an individual or group basis during morning reading, center time, or free choice will help students gain access to books, recognize letters, make letter-sound connections, recognize site words and aid in comprehension. Furthermore, this will instill my students with a sense of confidence that they are reading the book along with the recorded reader. Additionally, the listening center will foster productive interaction with technology and further develop their fine motor skills. A listening center will be a wonderful addition to the classroom.

Bamboo Pen Tablets will allow my students to produce drawings and diagrams of their ideas digitally then display them on their ePortfolio websites. These devices will be used to construct sketches and plans in our STEM Engineering class. Fewer students in the United States are pursuing careers in engineering. This concerns me because engineers are the designers and innovators in our society. If we want to strengthen our economy we need to invest in our future and inspire students toward careers in engineering design. The new common core Next Generation Science Standards emphasize engineering and design thinking. This is an important shift in education from standardized teaching toward problem based learning. In response, I have created an engineering class which focuses on design thinking and problem solving. It is very exciting for our school, which is in Central California. We are a low income community and many students are disadvantaged financially. Many of my students have never been out of the city. They do not have many opportunities. This year has been the hardest for us. Our district is facing big budget cuts. Our spending has been frozen and reduced, which is why I am seeking funding outside of the school. The new Common Core is inspiring a shift from a focus on 'correct answers' to developing student ideas. Students come to the classroom with an entire belief system in their heads. It's important for teachers to find out what students think, uncover any misconceptions in that thinking, then challenge those misconceptions with activities and projects. An important piece in this strategy is to ask students to create explanations of their thinking. One way students do this is by drawing diagrams and writing about how systems like the carbon cycle work. With Bamboo tablets, students will be able to draw these diagrams on the computer and post them to their ePortfolio websites. Posting their work publicly on the web gives students more accountability for their learning. Also, students will use these devices to do art and 3D CAD design. This will allow us to move away from using paper which is more earth-friendly. And student work will be online for parents and the public to view! Newspapers tell us we have many high tech jobs available in the US but we don't have the skilled employees to fill them. Students do not have the thinking and collaborative skills that industry wants. I've created an elective class to focus students on these skills.

They also allow students to add their own circuits, and write control programs for what they create. Our students are like the field in the picture, mature and ready to harvest...to add their minds to the storehouse of knowledge. But it takes special tools and effort to reap that harvest. We are a lower middle class school. For those of you who understand what it means, 51% of our students qualify for the free lunch program. In spite of this we are not in a low enough income bracket to get much special government funding. Many of my students are bright enough to attend college, but the reality is that many will need to get jobs to support themselves and their families as soon as they graduate. It takes a lot of vision and commitment for that type of student to put in the extra effort to add additional education or trade school to their after High School schedule. We work on vision casting. We try to instill a dream that stays with them and motivates them well after High School so they will make a brighter future for themselves. BoeBots are not toys. We have one of the Lego Mindstorms kits, and it has many great features, but the reason we use the BoeBot platform is that it uses industry standard parts and programming. Students learn Basic and C++, languages that translate into jobs after they leave us. I can introduce you to industry partners that use the Basic Stamp (the micro controller that powers the BoeBot), to design and build their real world products.

Our students are individuals who couldn't find public school supportive enough to fulfill their educational needs and wants. They are creative, talented, and each bring their own unique background experience to the table. For some, this school brings the only structure and positive social interaction they have in life. For others, it was an alternative from dropping out of school because of bad life choices, or the failure to reach the demanding requirements in order to graduate in the normal time span. Our school is set in a rural community and draws in students from the surrounding counties. This allows our students to interact with different peers, normally unknown if attended public schools in an environment were being 'different' is 'normal'. My goal is show these students not to limit themselves based on their expectations, but learn to reach beyond mine. The resources we are requesting are essential for us to build underwater ROVs. The STEM curriculum is integrated into our science classes, giving the students a more hands-on, meaningful experience. The students learn such things as buoyancy, underwater biology, wiring, design, and much more. The objective with each project is then to compete with other schools (private, public, and alternative) around the state to test our innovative designs and theories. Having the materials will help us reach more students who respond more to hands-on learning verses kill and drill traditional learning. By building these ROVs, students are learning more about careers in engineering, robotics, natural resources, wiring, and architectural design. This is our first year doing the underwater ROVs, and we hope to start a friendly rival with the IVD team at our school who have won awards for their electric car designs. The donations to this request will make such a huge positive difference, first, by showing our students that there are people in the world that do care about their education; second, by providing unique experiences at our school that the local public schools don't provide.

We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past four years, our small initiative has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. This calendar year, a small group of students will be traveling through Spain and Portugal. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the religious influences on art and literature, strengthen their Spanish speaking skills by volunteering with a community center, and compare the traditions, cultures, and cuisine to what they are accustomed to. They will be part of nightly conversations that ask them to reflect on the experience in the moment. Much of their experience will be captured in nightly journals that will be collected. These will assist with their research upon returning. In funding this grant, you give another student the opportunity to travel with us. The total cost covers everything for the student, including transportation, meals, and all activity costs. The research, experience, and life long lessons that are produced from these tours are true testaments to the value of this program.

Some things are too important to just wish for, which is why I am turning to Donors Choose to get these supplies. We are a rural school district in Central Washington. All three schools are on a single campus, with about four hundred students at the high school. A lot of the students' parents are field laborers with limited proficiency in English. Approximately 80% of our students are Mexican. The vast majority of the students appreciate the value of a good education and work to take advantage of what is being offered to them. With these kits, my students will be able to construct working motors. Reading about how motors work is a poor substitute for actually making a motor from start to finish and watching it spin. Without these kits, electric motors will be nothing other than a bunch of abstract vocabulary. With these motors kits, students will learn the fundamental principles behind a number of devices that are used on a regular basis, such as fans, blenders, and vacuum cleaners, just to name a few. They will learn how some wires and electricity can be used to make practical devices that we rely on every day. It's important for students to have engineering experiences as well as science experiences. I think that engineering is grossly neglected in secondary education. Yes, science is important and paves the way for many engineering advances, but pure science doesn't bring improvements into our lives--engineering does.

The students incorporate their own photos, video journals, and narratives while tackling critical problems like water filtration, the global economy, or religious uprisings and the governments level of involvement. A dedicated group of students will be traveling through Morocco. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the geography that makes living conditions challenging, compare the education system with that of our own, and practice their new formed language skills that they have learned prior to arrival. They will volunteer and give back to the local communities by working with local villages and after school programs. In funding this grant, you allow another student this opportunity.

These students have heard of STEM, but due to the budget have not had the hands on opportunities that they need. Students are craving the ability to have hands on scientific encounters. STEM is a concept that is brewing in our county. These STEM kits will be able to jump start the students knowledge on alternative energies. Alternative energy is a highly publicized topic of conversation and students need to have a firm foundational understanding of alternative energy. Science should be learned by doing science and not by having to learn solely from websites and outdated textbooks. Students need opportunities to experience the STEM sensation and learn about alternative energy from hands on activities.

This is especially true for the PK-4 students I serve in the school library. Currently, their only option for reading is the floor or one old bean bag that they vie for. The students I serve are friendly and motivated to learn. They attend a low-income school in Illinois and many of them come from homes where English is their second language. Often my students only access to books is in the school library. They work hard to learn each day, and deserve a comfortable and inviting library. In order to create a comfortable reading environment for my students I am asking for beanbag chairs, reading pillow seats, and a rocking chair that all of my students can use when they curl up on the floor to read. These new seating options will give my students the opportunity to spread out in the library during reading time and still be comfortable. By being more comfortable, they will also be more engaged in their reading and be more motivated to curl up and enjoy a good book.

No matter how many times or ways your teacher explained it, it just didn't make sense. My students have encountered this same problem. Learning games provide an engaging way to help those concepts develop and stick. My students live in a small rural area. They attend a small school that is home to PK-5th. Class sizes vary from 15-26 depending on the grade level. Currently they are in a class of 16. They are all eager to learn new things. Like all third graders, they enjoy playing games. They are a very close group who support and encourage each other. Most of them have attended the same school since PK. I am requesting board games to help with difficult concepts in reading. I have found that my students struggle with things like main idea. I chose sets of bingo and literacy games that I could use as a whole class or small group activity to help the students make meaningful and engaging connections to the concepts that they struggle with. I also requested math games and books that will help introduce new topics and give students hands on engagement with the new ideas. I also chose a set of timers to help assist in game play and keeping up with transition times between centers or games. Donations to my request will make a huge impact in my students' day to day learning experiences. I am a first year teacher who has few resources outside of the traditional textbook. These games will make it possible to reach my students who learn in nontraditional ways. It will help them make meaningful connections with the concepts and keep them engaged.

Now, we need to finish equipping our shop to make our students competitive with those from more affluent schools. The drill press will be one of the hardest working tools in the shop. The 3,339 mostly (91%) Latino students in grades 9 through 12 attend our school at the southern tip of the city of Los Angeles. Surrounded by several refineries and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the school serves a blue-collar, working class community with a substantially (70%) economically-disadvantaged population. The majority of our parents work for these industries and others in the Los Angeles industrial harbor vicinity. Our Robotics Team is made up of general and special ed students who are interested in design, engineering, and manufacturing. Before joining the team, many of them didn't know what type of work engineers do. After experiencing Robotics competitions, many of them want to become engineers. Each year in the FIRST Robotics Competition, students have six weeks to design and build a robot to compete in FRC's 'Varsity Sport for the Mind', a 3-on-3 high-energy robot sporting event. Students participate in a range of experiences they would otherwise be unlikely to experience. They communicate with local business representatives, develop and lead squads within the larger team to accomplish specific tasks, design parts and systems, produce digital renderings, solve difficult problems, and program computer micro-controllers. This intense event is made even more valuable when students have the equipment and materials available to properly fabricate parts. Students learn skills that are applicable to a wide range of jobs and careers. The safe and successful operation of machinery plays no small role in that experience. We are requesting a floor drill press that will serve our team for many years. Students will learn valuable job and craft skills. Our students are best served by being exposed to multiple career options and by learning skills that will serve them in many jobs. The U.S. needs more students with practical skills and experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Robotics serves this function beautifully. All of our students learn skills and practices that range from machine operation to project management. Few high school programs provide such rich learning experiences.

Hand-eye coordination is such a key in developing skills that carry over to all parts of their education. We are a pretty diverse school. We have students who come to us 'kindergarten ready', but a number of students who are not. We are an urban school with a good reputation for offering students a diverse education. Our students work hard to become respectful learners, citizens, and caring people. We are requesting materials for hand-eye activities, which are also called manipulatives. These activities introduce students to new movement skills and teaches them about basic catching and throwing, which amazingly many students do not know before they come to school! Eye hand activities open students up to more than the activity that they are doing. I have seen students create games using scarfs that are for juggling. They can make a game out of a bucket and a bean bag. My goal for the balloons, scoop balls, and Katch a basket set, etc. is to connect the left and right brains of students. I think this is the pathway to learning and following directions, and like so many things, will give students success later in life, not just in sports, but in other ways. Eye-hand units are great ways for students to find success in class, explore their bodies and how things work. The first time that a student hits a tennis ball is a great thing to witness. Watching students catch and throw for the first time is always a thrill. I am a strong believer that eye-hand activities develop both sides of a student's brain. When the left and right brain have to work together, students have better success at school. This is a great opportunity for students to learn basic motor skills like catching and throwing. We also want students to be respectful learners and work together to solve problems. Our order includes equipment that will challenge the students and get them excited to learn, play and discover!

Putting in notes using midi keyboards would be much easier than using laptop track pads. My students are middle school students attending a magnet school for the gifted in Illinois. These students are taught using inquiry based teaching and are highly motivated to learn new things. Most have attended the same school for gifted students since first grade. In our music classes, we introduce composing using computers. Despite some having limited experience with music instruction, students don't balk at trying this new concept, and embrace it with enthusiasm. My students need 12 midi keyboards for our composing classes. My students have been entering notes in the Finale program, by clicking on each individual staff line or space to place the notes. This is difficult enough with a mouse, but we are using laptops, making it even trickier. With the purchase of these midi keyboards, students will be able to plug them in and play the note they wish to place instead. This will not only speed up their composing process, but will help them to learn the location of notes on a piano keyboard as well. Introducing these children to creating music is an important part of their education. Creativity is highly valued in the work place and this project could potentially impact their future careers. Being a risk taker and stepping out of ones comfort zone is just the sort of life preparation we like to provide for these students.

We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past four years, our small program has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. A dedicated group of students will be traveling through the United Kingdom. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the economic structure of an international superpower, compare the education system with that of our own, and strengthen their interview and public speaking skills by shadowing employers. They will volunteer in local communities by working with local farmers and after school programs. In funding this grant, you allow another group of students this opportunity.

The math manipulative's that I want for my students will provide an excellent opportunity of learning for my students. With Common Core Curriculum being the new testing requirement for our students, hands on opportunities will be a perfect fit for every child. Each student will be able to explore the math concepts on their own and be able to describe how they have come to the answer. By being able to express how they have come to an answer helps them have a greater understanding for the math concept. Also, it fits to every child learning style. All students learn differently so these activities help differentiate instruction and allow for enrichment activities for the students. As an added bonus, the students love hands on activities. This makes them motivated to learn and to love math. They provide positive peer interaction and an overall exciting atmosphere for our students. Please help me provide more opportunities for hands on learning for my students. Education is so important for young learners and they will benefit tremendously from the use of manipulative's.

Even though most of my students face hardship, they come to school excited about learning, especially reading. With the resources I've requested, my students will be interacting in reading literacy centers. I've requested grade level book sets to have my students engage in book groups. This opportunity would allow them to discuss books as a group and learn together. I've also requested some picture books to read aloud to my students. We will use these texts to show how authors use writing in powerful ways, practice reading comprehension skills, and use before, during, and after reading strategies. With these powerful tools, my students' reading comprehension and enjoyment will increase. I hope to see a positive boost in reading success levels with the use of these resources.

However, I will also have students who are on and above grade-level that would benefit from this enrichment. I am determined to meet the needs of ALL my students. For many decades, reading and writing has mostly been composed of make believe; fairytales, talking animals, and magic. Students find themselves addicted to these types of text as well as movies. They rarely run to the nonfiction section of the library. It is important that I teach my students the importance of factual information and how to summarize and decide what's important.

Through small group work and learning centers I know I can create a classroom environment that is successful and effective for all my students! My classroom is currently full of 34 second grade students who are all eager to learn and come from very diverse and difficult backgrounds. I teach in a high poverty neighborhood in Arizona, where most of the population in our school are English Language Learners. Our kids have a strong desire to learn and challenge themselves, despite the hard challenges they face at home. They are extremely hard workers and push themselves to 'Achieve the American Dream'.Teaching with small groups and learning centers gives each child the time, effort and education they deserve, and with this teaching easel that can be done so much easier. Our space in limited with so many students, and so many desks so we are trying to find creative ways to store manipulatives and items the students need to use. However, with this storage cart and easel in one I can create centers or small group work that the students will be able to access all in one place. My students deserve the best education possible, and tools such as this easel will help provide quick transitions and easy access, in order to promote more learning time. I can see my students teaching each other using this easel as well, and I cannot wait to put this resource to use in my classroom! I truly believe that a large teaching easel/storage cart could make a huge difference in my students' behavior and learning opportunities. My students will have easy access to learning centers and small group work, which in turn will allow me to meet the needs of my students much more effectively!

We need your help to supply our special education classroom with some working technology to help contribute to the success of our students. Our school district is based in a low income town. Our middle school has a specific program called the Target program. The Target program supports students with emotional disorders. Our students need extra help in all core areas, along with encore classes such as music and physical education. In our program this year we serve 12 students. Our students range from sixth grade through eighth grade. These students come from very diverse backgrounds, and live within a low income population. A few students from our group are considered at risk youth and use school experiences as a positive way to be get involved.I have requested two new desktop computers and mouse pads so our students will be able to succeed in many areas. Having new desktops that boot fast and operate at a good speed will increase productivity time in our classroom. These computers would help a great deal in getting our students involved in using technology to complete work in our special education classroom. We are not always able to use computers within the building, so having the computers directly in our classroom would eliminate time wasted on locating open computers for our class, and transporting the students out of their classroom environment. These computers will provide us with an easy way to research and learn. If we have computers that work, we will have students more excited to use technology in our classroom. These computers would not only serve the current students in our program, but many students to come. With your help our students will be impacted greatly. Our students deserve a chance to interact with today's technology and they deserve to do so in fast and productive manner. If our students have the opportunity to learn 21st century skills, they will be able to practice skills that can be used in their bright futures. The information they will be able to learn, and the creativity they will be able to channel through a computer will help meet many of their educational goals.

Drawing inspiration from the civil rights leaders of the past, my students will use government knowledge and critical analysis to build the social movement of today. Support their path toward increased equality! My students cannot possibly be summed up in words. They are bright, silly, and passionate. You will never be without laughter on any given day in my classroom. These students are full of potential, but have been broken down by the gaps in education and poverty that engulf their Texas community. My kids will most likely get by if they continue on their current path right now. They will find jobs, get married, and have children. But they will not be living up to their potential. For the most part, they will work in blue-collar jobs and will struggle to provide for their families. Many of them will not go to and through college because they will not be able to afford it and will not know how to succeed in an environment with a whole new level of rigor. Again, they will be able to get by on what they have, but they will not be reaching their full potential. But this is not enough. Within my classroom, I will seek to forge with them an alternative path. Walking into school every day underneath the banner proclaiming the building as a 'technology center' is a struggle for my students. Although there is some up-to-date technology in the school, the portable building where I teach does not boast such amenities. With the addition of Kindle Fire tablets, my students will be able to integrate technology into their project research. They will research topics such as homelessness and educational gaps to gain a greater understanding of what is occurring in their communities right now. They will first use the poster board and decorating supplies to present their topics to their friends and family within the neighborhood community. Then, using the Kindle technology, they will create a social media campaign to reach out to outside communities. With the tablets, my students will be able to access websites such as Twitter and Change.org to actively engage in political discourse every day. They will use real time information to create change. The urgency of youth involvement in politics is undeniable. However, most of my Texas-based students feel disconnected to the goings on in the nation's capital. My students live in a low-income community with little access to technology in the home. With the addition of Kindle Fire tablets into my class, students will experience government as a living and continuously changing subject. More than this, they will use all of the supplies to actively engage in politics and voice their opinions. ","My students need 4 Kindle Fire tablets for project research within their small groups.

The specific apps will be chosen with individual student needs to help differentiate instruction. Many of my students do not have access to any type of technology within their homes, so it is up to the school to provide this opportunity. Our school is a Math Science Technology Magnet school, there are 34 students and two computers in my classroom. We are a title 1 school. So many of our students get breakfast and lunch for free. The two iPad minis in my classroom will engage and challenge my students with brand new and interactive methods. I will use the iPad minis to differentiate instruction through small groups. This way I will be able to individualize instruction for those students who are outside my small group and the group I will be working with. Since students all know how to play various electronic games, such as PSP, XBOX, Wii, and many others, I feel these iPad minis will help engage and motivate my students in learning the skills they need for reading and math interactively. The speakers will help us hear what we record. The tripod will help us set up a station to record with the iPad mini. The Flash drive will help save all their recordings. The covers will protect the iPad minis. My students need the two iPad minis, tripod, speakers, flash drive, and covers to allow them to learn at their own differentiated levels.

Many of the headphones that are on our mobile lab are 5 years old and are broken. Many of my 3rd graders cannot hear the math problems or the stories on Successmaker, which is our individualized learning program. Our charter school has students from a broad economic background. Many families are Title One families. We have to rely on the support of grants or donations to get most of our technology. Unfortunately, when we have our mobile computer lab, many of the students are frustrated because we do not have enough headphones for the students to use. Many of the original headphones are now 5 years old and broken. There are no headphones to use. The students cannot hear the Successmaker program. All students benefit with reading and listening to the program. It helps with their fluency as well. Students who have a low reading level are at a particular disadvantage using our Successmaker program because they cannot read accurately and with fluency the problems on the computer screen without headphones. I believe all of my students need reliable headphones. If each child has their very own headphone to be responsible for, I believe that they will last several years. My Project: The most important computer program in our school for math and reading is our Successmaker computer program. Successmaker is unique in that it can find the student's ability level through questions and problems that the student answers. Then Successmaker individualizes the program to each student's abilities. With a headphone, each one of my students will be able to understand not only by sight, but by hearing the words and sounds all of the educational activities on Successmaker. This will definitely impact the ability of my students to learn their math and reading in 3rd grade. Each of my students will succeed and get confident in their understanding of important concepts of the Common Core. When each student has their own headphone, they will be responsible for a certain labeled headphone that will be placed in a storage bin. I have students of all levels of reading and math ability that need to understand through sight and sound the educational activities on Successmaker.

They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The work produced is extremely high level, but more importantly, their investment in their studies has never been higher. The students are asking questions and seeking out information on a culture they previously new little about. Right in front of our eyes, we are forming a new generation of global citizens. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Despite the fact that our students come from low income neighborhoods, they manage to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. The success of this program is epitomized in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. The students incorporate their own photos, video journals, and narratives while tackling critical problems like water filtration, the global economy, or religious uprisings and the governments level of involvement.

This year is a giant transition for them as their middle school was shut down due to budget cuts and they were moved to the local high school where I teach. For the most part, they are the group that represents the above average sector of their grade level, and I believe that researching first amendment court cases and then reading 'Nothing But the Truth' will produce critical thinking and writing from this group. The school they attend is in a lower socioeconomic area where there is little parental involvement. The majority of our school population receives free or reduced lunch.

Additionally the students come to me with very little prior or background knowledge of the world outside their community which makes discussion of literature difficult. I will be able to integrate civics into the English classroom by doing a pre-reading activity with the first amendment. Students will understand the first amendment of the constitution as it applies to public school students. They will learn concepts such as advocacy of illegal action, commercial speech, and forum. They will research cases where students' first amendment rights were violated such as Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) where students were suspended for wearing black armbands as a silent protest to the Vietnam War. They will identify the facts of each case, each sides' position, the decision held by the court, and its effect on the country. Students will be grouped by case and will create a digital presentation to share with the class. As a class, we will then read 'Nothing But the Truth' where a student is suspended for humming/singing along to the Star-Spangled Banner instead of standing at silent, respectful attention.

The document camera that I am requesting will be used to show student work to the rest of the class for us to be able to determine an appropriate course of action in solving various algebra problems. Common Core is based on letting the students work through situations based on questioning and answering and discussing different ways in solving a problem. I feel that a document camera is the best way in order for a class to actually see work and determine what should or should not be done in order to solve the problem. In order for students to be successful in the work force, they need to be able to think analytically, have a creative and innovative mind, and have the curiosity and imagination to take them further. A these skills can all start by using a document camera to view and critique others work.

We exchanged our individual messy desks for clean, space saving group tables to foster collaborative learning. Our pencils used to get swallowed up in the darkness behind all the clutter of notebooks and folders. Now we need an orderly way to store our supplies. My students come from many different cultural backgrounds with many different experiences they bring with them. Yet they all have the same desires, to be successful in school. Our school is a Title 1 school with most of our students on free and reduced lunch. We are an International Baccalaureate school which strives to inspire global mindedness in our students. Our schools mission is to create a learning community where students use the inquiry process to become knowledgeable, develop intercultural understandings, and become active, caring and lifelong learners. We have recently acquired five collaborative group tables in place of our individual desks. We would like have a management center for each table to organize their supplies like their Daily Language workbooks, Inquiry Journals, working folders, etc. While individually the students had a hard time keeping their desks clean and finding their materials, the management centers will allow them to work together to keep their supplies organized in an easy to use way. The centers will help us make every minute count in our hectic daily schedule! The construction paper organizer will be used to store our commonly used graphic organizers/thinking maps for writing, inquiry, and reading. This will enable the students to easily record their questions, ideas, and new learning in a more independent manner. Many students need these supports to be more successful in class and increase their academic growth. Please help us make every minute count and improve academic growth with these classroom organizers. The management centers will allow us to be more efficient with our collaborate work.

I teach third grade in a very low-income neighborhood in California with 100% of my students receiving free or reduced meals and 90% are English language learners. It is a very diverse population with Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Indian, and Black students. Many of the students are considered high-risk due to the conditions in which they live (gangs, violence, and drugs). They are also the most charming and eager students anyone could hope to meet. My students thrive in an atmosphere that is consistent, fair, and filled with many opportunities to express themselves Imagine going to work every day and having to sit in old, hard, heavy chairs. It is not a comfortable learning environment for students. They spend more than half their school day sitting in these chairs. The Virco Zuma chairs are comfortable, light weight, ergonomically designed with the student in mind, and the cool cantilever shape makes sitting down fun! When children are sitting correctly, they can spend their energies focused on learning rather than on finding a more comfortable way to place their bodies.

Often they are at a disadvantage because they have difficulty providing for themselves the required resources they need to be competitive in school. To be successful in calculus, my students need to constantly practice their learning and acquired skills and knowledge by doing homework, which more often than not requires a graphing calculator. I would like to have extra calculators that I can check out to them to help them with their homework.

My students are in a Chicago Public School which has an enrollment of 1,350 students, with 88% of them being low-income and 32% English language learners. My students love to use technology whenever they get the chance because many do not have much technology when they leave the school. As educators who are able to buy certain technological devices, we tend to forget that many of our students do not have that opportunity. Technology is the new resource that engages our students and challenges them academically. Every Monday my students read differentiated articles and answer questions about the article using an online program called Teen Biz. There is a huge problem with implementing this program for all of my students because we do not have enough netbooks for my students. My classes range from 33-38 students! I have to allow my students to use my personal tablet and laptop because we only have 30 netbooks. I also have to send two students to two different classroom to use a desktop. Even with all of these accommodations, there is always at least 2 or 3 students that are not able to do Teen Biz because we do not have enough netbooks. Although some of my students use their cellphones to complete the articles and questions, the small screen on the phones is not beneficial to reading long articles and answering questions. The use of the requested tablets will also serve as an additional resource for my ELL's and struggling readers with the use of specific apps. The tablets will also serve as additional research devices. Honestly, it is a struggle to implement Teen Biz because we need more technological devices. The tablets will allow more students to do Teen Biz activities and improve their literacy skills. Technology motivates and engages all students, regardless of their academic level. The tablets will also expose them to more complex texts, allow my ELL's to acquire language faster, and serve as an additional technological resource in the classroom.

My school is located in an area where most of the families do not have much money, and often barely have enough money to cover their basic needs. My school is a choice school in our district so parents from any part of the district can choose to send their students to our school. The families here want only the best for their child and work hard to help their children to succeed in school even if they have limited time, money or even English speaking skills at home. The listening center will be allow small groups of students to listen to a story and follow along with the reader in their book. After the story they will be able listen to questions and check their comprehension of the stories even if they are still working on becoming independent readers. Having this listening center will allow one more center in my classroom so I can have smaller groups to work with and give students more personalized help during their time working with me each day. The whisper phones will be used when students are practicing letter sounds and decodable reader books. It can become very noisy with students reading to themselves, but these whisper phones will allow them to whisper their words and still hear themselves saying it without distracting others in their group or the entire class. These items will help my students become strong independent readers and listeners.

In just a few years, our program has given students the opportunity to explore the world. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The work produced is extremely high level, but more importantly, their investment in their studies has never been higher. The students are asking questions and seeking out information on a culture they previously new little about. Right in front of our eyes, we are forming a new generation of global citizens. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Despite the fact that our students come from low income neighborhoods, they manage to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. The success of this program is epitomized in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. The students incorporate their own photos, video journals, and narratives while tackling critical problems like water filtration, the global economy, or religious uprisings and the governments level of involvement.

These hands-on active play resources will help my students gain the practice they need not only through the school year, but also while attending summer school. Additionally, my students will also be learning new vocabulary, practicing math skills, and learning some science concepts. By having these additional opportunities to learn these academic skills, my students will begin to generalize the concepts and learn that language, math, and science can be done outside while having fun in the sun!

My students have struggles, but they don't let that stop them! Often we make our own supplies or make do with what we can find, but some things are impossible or too time consuming to make. We could really use some help! We will be learning about different habitats around the world. First, we will make books and do activities to learn about each habitat. As we do, we will be identifying different places where each of those habitats are located. This will give my students a better understanding of the beautiful world we live in. They will develop a wider perspective and take ownership of the earth. Next, we will explore our own habitat and discuss the importance of doing our part in taking care of our planet. Students will make use of the magnifying glasses as we explore plants, animals, soil, rocks, and more in the environment right around our school building. We will come up with ways we can improve the environment and make a commitment and a plan to do so! Students will gain a better understanding of our world and their part in it. I am excited for them to create, discuss, and explore. They will enjoy learning about the beauty of various habitats and how they are connected. As we 'travel' around the world, they will discover that each environment needs to be taken care of and protected. When we 'return' to our habitat, we will discover what we can do to take care of our environment and how doing just that, in effect, helps the world.

The iPad compliments all learning styles and can be used across all content areas. Our Elementary has four kindergarten sections of approximately 22 students a total of 76 kindergarteners. They are full of energy, enthusiasm, and a desire to learn! The goal of the grant is to use the iPads to improve student achievement across all populations. The touch screen facilitates easy use for tiny fingers still developing fine motor skills. The highly visual and animated delivery of iPad educational apps captures their imagination, motivates their desire to learn, and provides the authentic use of technology to master essential knowledge and skills. We are requesting three iPads. One of our teachers previously received an iPad through a grant. If this Donors Choose project is funded, the iPads will be placed permanently in each classroom. The use of the iPads will offer a plethora of appealing, hands-on learning experiences that will facilitate the mastery of kindergarten skills. The iPads will be utilized by independent student use in literacy and math stations. Students could use Tellagami, Videolicious, or Puppet Pals app to retell or create their own fairy tale. Another possibility would be to use Educreations app to describe the plant cycle or their animal research. Haiku Deck could be used to show their learning about landforms or science tools. The possibilities are endless! We want to provide a technology tool that will appeal to our 21st century learners, enhance instruction, and increase student learning. Growth with Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) scores and math performance tasks scores will be indicators of the success of the iPads. The implementation of daily iPad use is aligned with purposeful, meaningful, and engaging learning opportunities directed toward mastering academic skills.

Each child had a copy of the book while I read aloud to them. Every single student was engaged! Day by day they anticipated what will happen next. Students also created a 'Sassy Journal' exploring point of view. My students are third graders with a real passion for hands-on learning through books. When reading aloud to them I see the sparkle in their eyes, but I also see them more engaged if they also have a copy of the book I am reading. It is often difficult to keep their attention for long periods of time. This, however, is NOT the case when it comes Sharon Draper's book 'Sassy-Little Sister is not my name!' This was one of the most rewarding times I spent with my students with a chapter book. There were chapter questions for each chapter where students had to revisit the chapter to answer. There were opportunities for creativity when students wrote in the character's point of view. After we finished book 1, the students said, 'This was the best book ever! Are we reading book 2-4?' Our school is comprised of all of the third and fourth graders in our district. We are located in a low-income area with a high rate of students receiving free or reduced lunch. My students will use the classroom sets of the chapter book series of 'Sassy,' by author Sharon M. Draper, during our reading block. During this time we sit in a 'U' shape with our desks and engage ourselves in book discussions for every chapter. We will answer questions created that are Common Core driven. Creativity will be involved, as they create their 'Sassy' journals, and students will be able to each have a copy where they will be able to work in literature circles with their peers. The book will also serve as a resource if students need to review the text for an activity or lesson involving the book. The students will be able to learn about writing point of view from a chapter book. The students will also be able to better understand a book through well thought out questions; based on the chapters and created by the Sharon Draper website. After reading the 1st book my students are truly becoming anxious in reading more chapter books. Donations to this project will improve my classroom as it will allow students to have a joyful experience with the love of reading chapter books. My students were at first hesitant to read chapter books. However, reading aloud with everyone having a copy impacted my highest reader to my lowest reader in my class. Everyone was engaged. I think that finishing a series with such an impacting character that the students lov, would influence them to read more chapter book series independently.

Involve me and I learn'- Benjamin Franklin My students come from a very low socioeconomic background and do not have the access to technology. Our school is 100% free breakfast, lunch and dinner if you stay for the after school program. We have the highest rate of ELL (English language learners) in the state and have a high amount of special education students. Even with all of these facts against my students they love school! They want to learn and come in each day eager to work hard! Since we have had the great opportunity through Donorschoose to add technology into our classroom I have seen my students excel. We are so lucky to have five iPads that each of my students now and in the future will be able to use and learn on. My ultimate goal is to get technology into the hands of each student. This is a huge challenge but I know it can be accomplished! With an iPad my students are able to work on reading, writing, science and social studies. At first I thought we would mostly use the iPad for math and reading but since receiving them we have been able to do science projects with the help of the iPad and social studies reports! WOW! Amazing what technology has brought to my classroom! I also use the iPad as a behavior reward. If a child has a good day he/she can earn time on the iPad. This has worked really well!This iPad will help my students work on the newest technology and will give each of them life skills they need to succeed.

Currently they are not ALL able to use their iPads to the fullest learning potential. I teach 16 bright third grade students. I teach in a school district where 54% are economically disadvantaged. Last year our technology department was able to move funds around and provided our entire third grade with iPads. These iPads have made huge gains for our classrooms in reading, math, computer science skills, and much more! Our third grade students are so grateful for the opportunity to have iPads in our classrooms, but we have found situations where keypads to go with our iPads are much needed. We use a computer skill learning program and it would be very beneficial to have keyboards to use it. In third grade we also create a lot of projects using PowerPoint and Word. These projects can be created on the iPads, but would be created much easier if we had keyboards. Also, next year our third grade students will take the Smarter Balanced Assessment and keyboards will make test taking much smoother. With our iPads we don't want our students to lose out on typing and we want to make use of our iPads the best we can. Currently we have received nine keyboards through Donors Choose and outside funding. My students use these nine any chance they get. We would like to add these six to get close to completing our classroom set. Receiving our iPads was a dream come true for our students. Having a classroom set of keyboards for our iPads would be like icing on their dream! These keyboards will allow my students to do everything they want and need to do on their iPads.

Their imaginations are like most kindergartners with one exception - most will NOT get an opportunity to vacation in exotic places until they become adults and even then, the opportunity might not be afforded to them. My students have an appetite for adventure and long to visit far away places that are found on our frayed continent carpet and in the books that are read to them. It is my desire to give them a sense of community and ownership of personal space when we have reading time and lessons on the carpet. My students are part of a K-8 Center with multicultural languages and cultures. Therefore, the appeal for materials to peak the interest and enlighten students of other cultures is always present. We pride ourselves in exploring the diverse differences found within the various cultures in our school. These students will have a special spot or country to identify when coming to the carpet for read-aloud, morning and/or afternoon sessions, and any other lessons which will take place in the carpet area. They will learn about being a community of learners who respect others and take responsibility of their respective country or spot. What a joy it would be for them to sing one of their favorite songs on the new carpet: CONTINENTS by Ron BrownPull out the map and what do you seeSeven chunks of the land, what can they be?Africa, Asia, Antarctica, when you get to Australia there's a kangaroo, andTwo Americas - North and SouthWhen you get to Europe - Open your mouth!The continents, con-tin-ents, con-tin-ents, the continents. By following the song, the students will jump on the location of each continent as they sing along. This would implant the continents into their psychic for future class participation. Each student will be assigned a country/flag from the carpet. They will take ownership of the country, explore the tastes, customs, apparels, and sounds of their individual country. This will enlighten them of the differences in cultures and those things which are alike in human beings. In addition, they will learn how to be respectful, responsible, and safe in the classroom and how it is a privilege to sit on the carpet and participate as a classroom community of learners.

They need a way to organize their books to help them become independent readers by the end of the year. My class of six-year old and seven-year old students live in a close-knit, low-income neighborhood. Many of their parents also attended our school. They love to learn but many face hardships at home; including parents who are incarcerated, one parent homes, and parents who fight often in front of them. Many of my students come to school to escape difficulties at home. School is their bridge to success. I see myself not only as a teacher of content but a role model for what one can achieve through hard work and perseverance. I try to open their minds to what awaits them in the world and what possibilities their futures can hold. Learning to read can be a daunting task. Students need many experiences with reading books and other materials. These durable book holders will allow my students a special place to keep the books they are reading. Now, their books often get pushed into their desks, sometimes damaging the book, or fall out onto the floor. My students love to read so they try to hold onto several books at once. These book holders will allow them to more easily see the books they have chosen and which ones they want to return to our classroom library. They can carry the book holders with them when looking for a cozy place to read. These durable book holders will benefit my current students, as well as all of my future students.

My pre-k students are four and five year olds who attend a public school in Texas with a high poverty rate. My students are either from families below the line of poverty or English as a second language learners. My students have a love for school, where they have many new experiences such as painting, puzzles, singing, and and listening to books. They are like sponges absorbing knowledge very quickly, and I am privileged to be a part of their growth! My students need books for read alouds to match our thematic units. Reading aloud to my students is one of the best ways that I can build their vocabularies. Especially with my English as second language learners, developing vocabulary is one of my biggest goals of the year. Our pre-k curriculum is organized by thematic units, so these books will provide additional read aloud opportunities that fit into our themes. The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book is an excellent way to teach and review upper case and lower case letters. The copies of Five Little Ducks will allow my students to hold their own copy of the book while they listen to the audio book. After I read the books aloud, all of the books in this project will be placed in my library center, where my students can re-read the books and re-tell the story. They will follow up their comprehension by drawing a picture of the stories in their journal. These books will be used for many years and impact many students! Having quality children's literature to read aloud to my pre-k students will develop their vocabularies with words that they will remember and use for their entire life! My hope is to develop a class full of children who love books and reading and who will never stop reading!

I have a classroom full of 20 5th grade students. They are fun loving and eager to learn. These students come from varying backgrounds and don't always get the opportunity to learn through interactive sites such as Cicero Kids. These students thrive when they are given the opportunity to learn. Learning is fun, and I want to share this love of learning with my students. Our school is a Title 1 school in Wyoming. Our school is located in town and it serves neighborhood students around the school. However, some of the students have to be sent to other neighboring schools, because we are full. Do you remember learning history in school, using only a boring textbook? Well I sure do! Even today we still have the textbook! The textbook is great, but we need more! We are requesting a subscription to Cicero Kids. This subscription will allow my students to have hands-on, interactive access to learning history. Students today are 21st Century Learners and having access to Cicero Kids will enhance their learning and will make them eager to learn more. We will use this interactive site to learn more about the history required in our standards. Not only will we be learning history, but Cicero Kids is cross curricular and it supports other areas of education such as reading, language arts, math, etc. My students will gain a wealth of knowledge through this resource in a fun and engaging way. They will be excited about learning history and they won't even know they are learning other subjects as well. I'm so excited about bringing Cicero Kids into my classroom!

If so, it's probably because you felt like you were memorizing information about dates, places, and people that didn't seem real. I don't want my students to feel that way about history. Students in our school include military dependents, English language learners, students with disabilities, gifted learners, and talented artists. They are all full of energy and curiosity. They want to understand what they study, rather than memorizing facts. My goal is to make learning fun and meaningful for them through interactive lessons. I believe that is the key to helping children develop a lifelong love of learning. CICERO Kids is a digital curriculum that would be an excellent way to help teach my students about our nation's history. Pictures, videos, music, maps, and timelines will make the content more meaningful because it will help my students visualize and understand historical events and their causes. The interactive games will keep my students interested and help them build and demonstrate knowledge. Since literacy, science, math, and character education are included in the lessons on CICERO Kids my students will build skills in other content areas as they learn history. As an added bonus, CICERO Kids can be accessed on any device with an Internet connection. That means it will be available to them at school, home, and on the go. Learning can happen any time, any place. Please consider supporting this project. It will help my students meet grade level standards in multiple subject areas while building a stronger foundation for their academic careers.

When my students see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know the next art project. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We have academic clubs after school, and daily pull-out academic programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. The pliers requested will be used by me to cut wire for my students painted sculptures. My students will bend and shape the wire into amorphic shapes and place on plastic sheet pocket protectors needed. They will take the window art paint needed to create colorful designs of lines, shapes, and patterns inside the wire. Once the paint dries, the students will peel off the plastic and form sculptures by bending and manipulating the pliable paint into 3-dimensional sculptures inspired by the famous artist Chiuly. This is an exciting, unique 3-dimensional project that I would also like to display in the library to generate art awareness an the importance to keep the arts in the public schools. Students will learn from the video needed that Chiuly has created glass blown art that is organically part of of nature. They will observe that he has colorful art installations around the world of glass blown art combining art, water, nature, flowers, and tress. Through the video and classroom discussion of Chiuly's work, my students will learn the importance of collaborating and sharing, leads to positive outcomes in the arts and life. They will learn that Chiuly is blind in one eye an is still able to create beautiful glass blown art by collaborating too. Many of my art students have not even been to a museum. This artist has had local displays in the tropical gardens. It's my job to bring cultural awareness about the arts and inspire my students.

Many students do not understand what an endangered species is or what it means. This project will teach them about that and encourage them to stand up and protect our wildlife. I teach a 4th/5th grade combination class. My students come from a high poverty neighborhood where more than 75% of them receive free or reduced-price lunch. There are a very diverse range of home structures: nuclear, single parent, multiple-family, foster, migrant, and military, to name a few. Our students also come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, with a large portion being Hispanic, Punjabi and African American. Additionally, we have a large population of English Language Learners. With such diversity, it is to be expected that each student is going to have a very divergent range of personal, social, emotional, and educational needs when compared to schools that serve a more homogeneous population. As a class we will be reading 'The One and Only Ivan', a story about a captured gorilla who befriends a captured baby elephant. My students will then be researching and learning more about endangered animals using the books requested. The students will be split up into groups and focus their research on one habitat and the endangered animals that live in it. During their research, the students will be using the scissors, glue sticks, and colored pens to record their information into their interactive journals. At the end of the research, each group will create presentations about the endangered species in their habitat and what we can do to help save the animals. The goal of this project is for students to share this information throughout the school and raise awareness of the animals on the endangered species list and share ways in which we can help. This project will engage and teach students through the high-interest class read, along with the other high-interest non-fiction books. Students will not only be learning about regular school topics, but they will learn how to make a difference in the world by learning about how to help and save endangered species.

As a dedicated teacher, I want to provide my students with a way to keep their bodies and minds active without disrupting the learning of others. This year I am teaching in a single-gender classroom consisting of twenty boys of varying ability levels. Our elementary school is located in a small town in South Carolina. Although the students come from a variety of backgrounds, there is one common problem that many of my students face- the need for movement. Many of my students are very active and full of energy. They often find it hard to sit still and focus on their work. Because of this, they often disrupt the learning of other students around them. My students are very smart and capable of anything; many of them just need help focusing. Standing desks and stability balls just may be the solution to our problem! The stability balls will enable students to wiggle while they work! The students will be able to move around, yet it won't distract others who are working around them. Instead of focusing on sitting still, students can focus on their learning while improving their balance, posture, and strength. The stability balls will be used for small group instruction, group work, and just anytime a child feels like they need to use one in order to focus! Students will also have access to the standing desks anytime they feel like they'd rather stand up to work/listen rather than sit still in their desks. I want to encourage my students to move and stay active, not sit still, and these alternatives will help to achieve this goal. While my active students will reap many learning and health benefits from these stools, this product will also be beneficial to the students around them because the movement is not large enough to distract my teaching or the learning of the other students. This new furniture will help all students become better focused and my teaching become uninterrupted.

I currently use one-sided velcro to assign seating. This summer, though, I'm teaching in a classroom that has the rug I'm asking for! The kids LOVE taking turns walking on the numbers while the rest of the class counts out loud. I envision assigning seating by letter, color, etc. to get kids sitting with different peers each day! We could also each sit on a letter and then play ABC games. Students love MOVING to learn, and this rug makes that possible. The learning opportunities are endless! Kids would also take more pride in a more beautiful classroom with this colorful rug. They deserve it! Please give my one-of-a-kind students a beautiful rug because they deserve beautiful things- they are our future! They learn the most when they get to MOVE, and this rug makes that possible!

You can help us create creative, eye-appealing posters for projects and to anchor student knowledge. We do lots of projects in class that require posters and visual aids. This electronic cutting machine will allow students to bring their own creative and artwork to the classroom. This project allows students to recycle materials and use dies and downloaded material again and again.

Not one day looks like the next and that is what makes my job the best adventure there is. However without having the right tools like a writing center my job becomes more challenging! I work at a Title I public school in New York that inspires children from kindergarten through 5th grade. We are a very diverse school with many different backgrounds in one. Many students come in not speaking any English at all and some parents require translators to communicate. My school population is extremely diverse. My class for the 2014-2015 school year will consist of 25 five year old students. They enter eager yet unsure of what to expect. I assure them that the year will be fun and engaging with many hands-on activities. I look forward to meeting them in September and to challenge them as we learn and grow together. I assure my students that they will have fun everyday with a smile and fun learning opportunities. They are MY students, but OUR future! Picture this- 25 kindergarteners moving about the room during center time, not knowing what to do. Now picture the same students working independently, with a purpose. The room is organized with the teacher is working with a small group - everyone is learning. The children are all learning and having fun doing so. However the problem I have is that the children do not have a writing center to call their own. The unit I am requesting will enable the children to have supplies at their fingertips and would encourage peer writing - it would be the perfect tool. We will be able to store group materials in the colored letter trays and each group will know exactly where to get their group activities. Sure it will take some time to create this level of independence, but it will happen especially with the help of this new addition. This center will enable me to provide peer support every child could use, organized materials and a friendly writing environment! Learning how to write can be extremely difficult and frustrating for a 5 year old, yet it is something they must do. First, they have to learn to form letters, then learn to use those letters to write words and finally learn to put these words into sentences. It can be hard work. Creating a friendly environment can help ease these worries and frustration. This writing center will be the perfect tool to creating a friendly and fun environment. Please help me teach the children of OUR future! ",My students need a writing center where they can sit with a partner and inspire one another.

Often we make our own supplies or make do with what we can find, but some things are impossible or too time consuming to make. We could really use some help! We are super excited to learn about money and the important role it has in our lives! As part of our 'Daily Math Skills' board, we count money everyday, but it is difficult to move the coins and bills up and down. With magnetic money we will not only be able to get them on and off the board quickly, but students will be able to manipulate the coins and bills for a more interactive and hands-on experience. They can move them as they count, rearrange, and make trades. With the iPad Mini, students will be able to practice skills on their own. They will make use of the many apps available. As much as counting money together is needed and a great learning experience, students need to be able to count money on their own. This is best achieved through repetition. Repetition is most effective when it is fun and engaging! Not many people like to sit and be drilled, but everyone loves a good game! The iPad Mini will help my students gain confidence and independence in financial literacy. It is so important to become financially literate. This is a life skill that students will use daily all their lives. Their educational experience with money and finances will be enriched and strengthened with these amazing resources. It will help daily instruction become more engaging and playtime become more educational!

The children LOVE to play their instruments, but they also need to learn how to maintain them and keep them in working condition! My students are energetic 4th graders who LOVE music. They want to sing, dance and play instruments. If they could do all three at the same time, they would still look for more ways to create music. The school population is entirely 3rd and 4th grade. The ensembles offered are Band, Chorus and Strings, but only 4th graders are allowed in Band and Strings. Since Kindergarten, they have learned how to listen to music, and now they want to make their own. The financial struggles in some of their households make it difficult get their own instruments, so they borrow them from the school. Unfortunately, these instruments have been around for a while, and the care, cleaning and maintenance supplies are long gone. Almost everything we have in life requires some type of care and maintenance. When you take the bicycles out of the garage after a long winter, you usually have to put air in the tires and grease up the gears. Throughout the summer, you still keep an eye on it, and make sure that everything is set for a smooth ride. The same is true for instruments. They must be cleaned and oiled/greased in order to be in good playing condition. When corks dry and crack, you cannot put or keep a clarinet together. When valves and slides are dry, it creates friction and resistance, which results in no music. The donations to this project will increase the quality of performance and practice because it will allow the students to properly care for and maintain their instruments. If the instruments are working properly, the students can practice without being distracted by instrument problems. Their lives will be changed for the better because they will know that people care about their music. It will also make them better, well-rounded musicians.

I set the expectations high and my students stretch to reach them. The poverty cycle affects my students in many ways. Poverty can be passed from generation to generation because of many factors, but one major factor is lack of financial literacy and understanding. Each year my students complete an economics unit. This unit is essential for developing financial skills that my students will use all their lives. I plan to use this Silhouette Cameo for an economics and math project in which students will create a restaurant menu and sales tickets.

This periodical will expose my students to a variety of genres and get them excited to read. My Title 1 school is filled with children who are waiting to be introduced to learning. Though a majority of my students are from a low socio-economic background, they are charged with enthusiasm for learning and interacting with new materials. Unfortunately, for most of them the only opportunity for this exposure is during the time they spend in school. These children depend on us to provide them with all they need to be well equipped for the world. Many of my students come from homes where either the parents do not speak English, work multiple jobs to make ends meet, or are just not involved in their children's lives. They have the hunger to learn and for these precious children an good education is their ticket out of their low economic barrier. They deserve to have the chance to turn their lives around.

I have used Scholastic Magazines in my classroom for years. Last year a colleague introduced me to StoryWorks. I was able to visit her classroom and see how she uses it with her students. I was impressed with how the students were engaged, interacted with the magazine and how they used it to collaborate in group discussions. The teacher used the issue as a starting point for individualized units of study. Watching her and her students interact and feeling the energy in the room that this magazine created gave me the motivation I needed to introduce it in my own classroom. Each subscription is centered around one essential question for students to explore. It includes 10 different genres, including poetry, interviews, and debates, just to name a few. The subscriptions also comes a digital component, allowing me to incorporate technology into the exploration of topics. Students will also be able to take these magazines home use them for homework assignments and share the information. As a teacher I know that StoryWorks will allow me to provide students with texts that are exciting to read in whole group, by themselves, or with a buddy. The variety of literature that StoryWorks provides allows students to explore beyond their borders. Unfortunately, I was not able to get this ordered through my school, but with your help my students will have a great addition to their reading selection.

They love saying 'hello' from different parts of the world. One of my challenges is to teach them about the world around them. This is one of many ways I teach multiculturalism. My students are bright five-year-olds. They love school and they love to learn. Often at my school I have to gather resources on my own to make the learning fun and relevant, but it is so worth it. When I see how engaged my students are in the learning, it's priceless. My school is in a low income community. All of the students qualify for free lunch. Many of my students live in the neighborhood. They consider the school, 'their school' and they absolutely love being there. My students and their parents know how important learning and being college and career ready is. At any point, you could come in my room and ask, 'What's more important than learning?' and they will reply, 'Nothing!' Another catch-phrase I say to them is, ' We're getting the knowledge..' and they respond, 'to go to college.' Beginning in Kindergarten, I want my students to already have the mindset they are going to college. I want them to learn about not just their community, but the World Community. These magazines are for kindergarten learners. These magazines allow my students to learn about the world around them in a fun, colorful, and inquisitive way. Two of the magazines infuse the learning around social studies topics that are engaging and current events. The science magazine will pique the interest of those little scientists in my classroom and nourish those inquisitive minds. My students will be able to read most of the magazine on their own.

I try to create an environment where students take pride in their classroom and design it to their artistic and individual personalities. In our classroom, students' own beautiful works of art decorate the walls. My students are bright, active, and sweet young learners. They are eager to learn whatever it is that I am willing to share. Although academics is a large part of the curriculum, I like to incorporate art and fun crafts to each lesson in order to keep the creativity alive in my classroom. I believe that it is just as important to keep students engaged with the arts - especially since budget cuts keep cutting costs in music, art, and physical education. I am currently a 1st grade teacher working in a Title One school in Los Angeles, Ca, where many students receive free or reduced lunch. My class also serves English Language Learners and a few students who receive extra support from the Resource Specialist for various needs. With a variety of abilities and disabilities in my classroom, it is important to provide my class with additional resources in order to meet the needs of all students and to keep them engaged in the curriculum. All of these materials will be used in the classroom and will benefit all of my students. With these materials, students will explore their individuality and create masterpieces in which they will be able to take home and treasure with family and friends. I truly enjoy incorporating art with academic lessons. By doing so, I am able to keep students engaged and students are able to explore their artistic and creative capabilities. With the beads, jewels, and gems, students can create beautiful works of art. Moreover, they can also practice creating patterns with numbers, size, color, and so much more. While working with these materials, students also practice developing their fine motor skills while they cut, arrange, and manipulate various objects with their tiny, little fingers and hands.

By 4th hour we are either doing Digital Photography, Graphic Design or Art Appreciation/Art History. 7th hour is the new and experimental Puppet Making class. My students are from Flint, MI and the surrounding counties. Since we are an alternative to a traditional high school, we have an extremely diverse group of students. Many of my students come from poverty stricken areas and households. This is the single factor that most of my students have in common. We are about 85% free and reduced lunches. Many come from violent environments, broken and unstable home environments. We have a large number of students who feel they just don't fit in with traditional high school. Students who are openly homosexual, pregnant, extremely intelligent, or socially awkward make up a large portion of the student body. Because of the many backgrounds and the small size of our school my students have an extremely strong bond and a fierce loyalty to the school. I think we also have a tendency to be much more creative than a traditional high school. My students tend to extremely empathetic to others. We pride ourselves in being involved in our community! The two items I am requesting are specifically for our new puppet theater that we are starting this year. We will be producing both indoor and outdoor productions. The puppets will range in size from 3 feet to parade style puppets which are sometimes up to 20 feet. Our first show will be this December. It is about dreams. The show will combine live puppetry, shadow puppetry, video, live music, recorded music, lighting, sound design, narration and a smoke machine I hope! Our main puppets are in the style of Japanese Bunraku puppets as well as European Marionette Portee style puppets. This means that the puppets are very high in artistic style and creativity. These are not Muppet style. Most of the puppets will take 3 students to operate. One for the head and arm, one for the back and other arm and one for the legs. Since we will be utilizing video and overhead projections as well as live music, narration and sound effects we are in desperate need of a movie screen and a sound system. Our intention is for our students to be able to tell stories relevant to their lives. Puppets are a great way for our particular student body to express themselves in a unique way. Controlling a puppet also takes some of the stigma of performance away from an otherwise nervous young actor.

My students are learning all subjects, including social skills and functional skills. My students need to attend a Civil War reenactment experience to bring history to life. This would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the majority of my students. I have attended the Civil War reenactment, and I am positive that this field trip would be one that they will not soon forget. Not only will they get to see the Blue and the Gray at battle, they will also get to go through an encampment and see how Civil War soldiers lived during that time.

When all you want to do is put your left leg in and shake it all about? I teach first grade. It is difficult for a first grader to sit still for long periods of time. And let's face it, should a first grader really sit still for that long? Hokki stools provide constant movement while the student 'sits' to complete work or explore concepts. The movement of the stool promotes physical well-being and balance to encourage a healthy lifestyle. These stools also promote intellectual well-being as the constant movement helps students focus. My students need three Hokki stools to provide movement and promote health in terms of both intellectual and physical well-being. A hokki stool is designed to give the person sitting on it constant slight movement. This helps the child get the movement they need while sitting at their seat. They are able to have a longer period of focus time to complete more work and learn in an environment that is suited to their needs.

My students want to do well in school and prove to others that they can work along side everyone else around them. My students need lessons to be differentiated so that they can display their knowledge. I work at a title 1 school. Our district is shared with the Onondaga Nation. We have a very diverse group of learners in our district. Many of the students I work with have very little support from home and come to school seeking structure and a helping hand. When the students are given hands-on materials to create with they get excited about the activity and forget that they are learning. They quickly are engaged and ready to write, read or discuss ideas when they have their project in front of them that they just created. If every topic can be attached to a hands-on project then these students are unstoppable! With these Quill materials we will be able to accomplish several activities. The bulletin board materials will be a great visual connection for the students during our Dr Seuss celebration unit. Students start to engage in discussions about the stories and make connections to stories they have read by Dr Seuss. The fish bank will be a craft related to the fish in the Dr Seuss stories. We will us the banks for storing rhyming words we learn, and descriptive writing pieces will be written about the fish they have created. They will also be carried over to our math unit involving money. The styrofoam balls will be used as decorations at Christmas time where students will design an ornament and then write a poem that goes with the project. Students will be able to wrap their ornament and give it to someone as a gift. This project will go along with our poetry unit and what it means to share the gift of giving. The donations to this project will help to improve the students excitement of learning and coming to school. The hands-on projects and visuals keep their brains moving and wheels turning. When there is something concrete in front of them it is amazing the work that is produced with very little hesitation. They love to show off their projects to others.

Physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited. My students learn through singing, movement, speech, creating and performing on instruments. 'Tell me, I forget, show me, I remember, involve me, I understand' (Orff). I teach 600 students in grades K-5 and they come to me for 45 minutes once a week. My school is a Title I school in a military town. Military families many times will move away due to orders or deployments, but often return 1 to 3 years later. Students at my school are eager to learn and are most excited about performing on instruments and creating and performing their own compositions. I recently certified in the Orff process and want to use this approach as a way for my students to learn. Students will learn through exploration and creating. With these glockenspiels, students will be able to improvise melodies (create on the spot), compose melodies, and accompany other students who are singing, moving, speaking or performing on other instruments. The music used in the Orff process is based on folk songs to which students have connections. They will be able to connect with students who are not from America (we have students from Yemen, China, Mexico, Columbia etc), places families have been deployed (Japan, Germany, Africa etc), and, of course, American folk music! While 2 more instruments may seem insignificant, having 2 more Orff instruments (glockenspiels) will allow more students to participate in an activity. This will reduce time and the number of groups switching out on instruments. More instruments will impact students by allowing them more learning opportunities and more time to appreciate those opportunities.

My second graders are in a school where the children come from a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and socioeconomic situations. The majority of my students receive free or reduced price lunch, which means their families are struggling financially. Each year I typically have a few students with learning disabilities and special needs. For second graders, hands-on learning is key. Being able to have real life projects they can work on and create is very important. Exposure to the arts is critical for a well-rounded education. Math and Engineering are important, but without art and an ability to visualize design our engineers will be unable to create and design the vehicles, structures, and technologies of the future. My students will be able to use this die-cut printer to design and create presentations and graphs of their projects and data. It will also help students learn to visualize, apply, and create artistic designs. These skills are directly transferable to more traditional engineering projects.

Envision a group of the sweetest, most wonderful 6, 7, and 8 year olds sitting comfortably on a brand new dinosaur alphabet rug, totally engrossed in a story their teacher is reading to introduce the next Common Core math concept. Imagine those same children during reading time excitedly choosing to sit on this colorful rug and read a book from the bountiful boxes of books we just received from Donors Choose, boxes full of books that inspire them because they can read these books that are 'just right' for them. Picture the students who are reading at or above grade level taking the station activities out of the box and independently choosing a topic, reading up on that topic at the rug, and then writing reports based on their new knowledge at the recently delivered writing desk that is fully stocked for them. Visualize those same children volunteering to share that new knowledge with the class by inviting them over to the fresh, clean rug area. What an amazing classroom that would be! These books, stations, rug, and desk will inspire my students to want to read, knowing that there are books they CAN read and a comfortable, clean place to do the reading at. They are such a fantastic group of kids who WANT to do better. These items will change their lives and give them the confidence they need to succeed and the motivation to keep trying, no matter how difficult it may be at times, knowing that there are other people out there who care!

Last year they watched in anticipation as the art classes created masterpieces and now it is finally their turn to show the world what they've got! My students are devoted to the school mission to 'Redefine Possible'. Almost all of the students in our school will be first generation college graduates and we work toward achieving that goal every day. Before enrolling in 6th grade, each student signs a college commitment contract with the school committing to eight long years of putting 100% every day to the goal of getting to and through college. Every day my students show tenacity to reach this goal, take for example this art course where my students are completing a high school credit in the 8th grade. As the first art course that many of them have completed, they relish the chance to tell their personal story through art. Thanks to your donation, we can create unbelievable works of art! This project includes classroom supplies for many of the projects that we will complete in the classroom this year. The canvas panels will be used for our painting unit at the end of this semester where each student will recreate Van Gogh's masterpiece, Starry Night, but with their own twist. This semester ends with the most meaningful painting project, the self portrait, where the art students find a way to depict both their inner and outer self using art. The watercolor paper will be used for a Georgia O'Keeffe inspired watercolor painting in the spring. Finally, the easy cut boards will be used for a printing project. Last year the printing project was a huge hit and students are still talking about it today! Funding this project will allow my students to experience a large variety of art mediums throughout their Art I course curriculum. Without canvas, watercolor paper and printing blocks my students wouldn't get the chance to see all of the possible ways they can create art. For most of them, art is drawing with colored pencils. Help me to unleash the artist inside and bring new, fun and expressive art mediums to our art classroom!

My goal? For kids to discover the magic of reading so they want to read more. Emerson Elementary is a thriving urban public school in Berkeley, CA. Our students come from a wide range of backgrounds, ethnically, racially and economically. What makes our school thrive? Our teachers are committed to reaching all students, creating a positive, supportive, engaged learning environment. Our relatively small size (300 students) means that as the librarian, I know each and every one of our kids. All of our students come to the library once each week to check out books, and I work with them to help them find books they are interested in and are at their reading level. But like so many schools, we struggle with funding and providing materials that engage such a wide variety of students. I am especially concerned about finding new ways to get kids excited about reading when they are reading significantly below grade level. This grant will enable our school library to start a Kindle pilot program, purchasing 10 Kindle e-readers. These will be available for all 4th and 5th graders to use, but we will focus on reaching kids who have been identified as needing extra support with reading. I will help students find e-books to check out from the local library, thus using our limited resources to stretch what we can offer our students. Students will be able to read at their level, without any social stigma of having a book that looks uncool or too young. The Kindle provides support for struggling readers in many ways, notably an integrated dictionary, text-to-voice read aloud feature for unknown words, and adjustable font size. Initial research in the field also indicates that the 'cool' factor of reading with new technology can increase students' motivation, especially when supported by a librarian who can help them find just right books to read. As the school librarian, I often see myself as a cheerleader for reading. But I know many of my students struggle with reading and hate checking out books at their level-- especially if that means books that seem too short, too young, and definitely not cool. My goal is to help all kids find books that make them want to read. Ian, who loves graphic novels but doesn't always sink into a novel, said, 'I like the feel of reading on the Kindle. It makes me want to read more.' Hooray!! ","My students need 10 Kindles, covers, and adapters to support and engage reluctant readers.",Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Technology,1831.56,Expired

For a majority of my students, English is their second language. It is my goal to provide my students with every opportunity for success. In this case, I want to help them grow into competent readers by helping them establish a solid literacy foundation and a love for books. That is where wordless picture books come in! For some of my students, there is nothing more frustrating than picking up a book that is too hard to for them read or a book that is falling apart. At first glance, it might appear that wordless picture books are simple stories, when in reality, they are very complex. Wordless books are perfect for introducing new vocabulary, improving oral language skills and developing higher-level thinking skills. They are perfect for students of all ability levels, not to mention the fun and enjoyment my students get when reading them. Their confidence will soar when they see that everyone can read!

The disparity is vast in Berkeley and the classroom is the bridge for all students. This year we have fully implemented Common Core State Standards. We are in need of technology within our rooms that easily used and accessible to young children. My goal is for our students to be able to use ipads to support evidence based thinking through technology that is user friendly. Ipads allow for young children to research topics of interest and access any skill work they may need through apps and web sites. My students are excited about learning and are always looking for more ways to expand their knowledge. In the classroom we often need to practice math facts, a way to research topics, and often have a need to answer questions immediately so we can then think deeply about the world around us. If my students could easily access the world through technology, it would increase their general knowledge about the world they live in. Our students would have extra opportunities for use of educational websites. My overall goal would be to have the students rotate on to the ipads as one of their daily learning centers. If a student needs additional help with math, but excels in language arts, there will be apps that allow for that student to practice math facts. Ipads also provide opportunities for students to explore science, writing and social studies with sites like Mobymax.com. This site individualizes content areas for students so they can expand the individual learning in any area they choose. It also provides the teacher with immediate feedback on each student's progress. Motivation is a critical component of learning. These ipads are highly prized items by my students.

I am an ELL teacher. So I have students that do not speak English. My students are an eager and excitable bunch. They are excited to come to school to find out what new thing we will be doing that day! My students live in an urban area with high poverty, but they don't let that stop them. My students can use this reading program at school, at the library and at home. We will use it during our guided reading/centers time. And I will ask the parents to use it at home. It is a reading program that helps them through all the basics of reading. It helps them with letters, sounds, and sight words. This program makes reading fun and game-like! It will also especially help my ELL students who will benefit from the pictures and vocabulary. This will help to improve our classroom, because not only will it give the students a directed and guided learning program for centers time, but it will allow them to access at home as well. It will also help my ELL students with vocabulary. ",My students need Ticket to Read. A computer reading program.,Literacy & Language,Grades PreK-2,Technology,393.53,Fully Funded

When my students see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know the next art project. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We have academic clubs after school, Saturday School, and daily pull-out academic programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. My students will listen to a story about Alexander Calder, discuss, and view samples of his 3-d wire works and mobiles for inspiration. Some classes will make mobiles using colored pipe cleaners wires, and beads to create fish. Other classes will make 3-d standing stationary sculpture which are called stabiles. They will make the stationary sculptures with shapes and wires representing wried sculptures that Alexander Calder was famous for. They will be colorful and mounted on the poster board. Students will be exposed to a famous artist Alexander Calder and learn another style of art by creating wire sculpture. They will use a kinesthetic approach of creating a 3-d sculpture. They will read and discuss a story about Alexander Calder in this engaging hands on activity.

Imagine the delight on their faces at having the resources they use during their daily centers in color when all they have previously had has been in black and white! You can only imagine the motivation that color can bring! My kindergarten classroom is filled with a wide range of energetic students--from those who have had minimal experiences in their lives to those who have had many. They are eager to learn and greet each new experience with enthusiasm! We are part of an awesome school community in Kansas that works very hard to meet the needs of each student in spite of continuing budget cuts. As a teacher, I have spent much of my personal money on classroom resources through online accounts such as TeachersPayTeachers, Mailbox and Scholastic. Much to my dismay I then discovered that many of those resources needed to be printed in color to make them usable in the classroom. Having access to a color printer, card stock to print on and ink refills for sustainability will finally allow us to use the resources purchased as they were intended. This will allow my students to learn more effectively as they will have colorful resources for centers, literacy and math games, and writing activities as a part of their daily learning experiences. Seeing this project fulfilled will add the motivation that color can bring into a classroom. My students will be able to use materials as the learning tools they were intended to be. We will not have to spend precious learning time 'coloring in pictures' to get resources ready to be used, but rather will be able to use our learning time wisely.

They love working on computers and shrill with excitement everyday their name is called to work on words. Because I only have two computers for 28 kids, they aren't able to use technology as much as they would like (or I would like). Ipads are wonderful learning tools that engage students in a variety of ways. They excite, motivate and inspire kids to learn a variety of subjects. The apps available for free is AWESOME. Students will engage in early reading skills such as letter naming, hearing letter sounds, tracing letters, rhyming, working on sight-words, counting, solving math equations, and reading. Not only will we utilize the apps, but iPads are a great tool to record students' reading abilities and then play it back to them to reflect on how they have grown as readers. They also would be utilized for me to assess current reading levels using the DRA program. Completing these on the iPads would save our school paper and ink as we would update our paper-pencil record keeping to digital. 'Every Child Succeeds.' Our district motto would be met by students being engaged, motivated and inspired to learn through the use of exciting tools.

That is how it was for my first graders when I introduced them to the Elephant and Piggie series by Mo Willems. They so love Piggie and her friend Gerald that the characters feel like two more kids in our classroom! I teach at a public alternative school. The literacy workshop curriculum keeps the students active and engaged. Like every primary teacher, my class includes kids who are already reading, as well as kids who are just dipping their feet in the water. It is for this latter group, in particular, that I am requesting a Donors Choose grant. I hope to buy a large set of these magical books that kids won't put down! I hope you'll come on board with me! Beginning readers confidently read what each character is saying because they have learned their personalities and ways of interacting. Pictures of them and their talking balloons have started surfacing in the students' drawings and I have even heard familiar exchanges during the kids' spontaneous drama. I knew we were on to something good, but unfortunately, there are not enough books in the classroom or library to satisfy this thirst. I want to use the Elephant and Piggie books in Readers Theater activities with students to help them build confidence and voice as readers. A larger collection of them can increase their use as take home, read-aloud-to-family books, because they are books these kids are dying to read aloud. When the occasional book is left at home, the other kids will not feel so disappointed. Elephant and Piggie will also contribute to my students' growth as writers, as the kids are already drawing these beloved characters and captioning their conversations with speech bubbles modeled after those in the texts. More copies spread out on the tables will invite them to add words they have memorized, or copy words that express what they want to say. Sight words will serve the greatest purpose (rather than flashcard practice), rounded out with best guess spelling that builds phonics knowledge and fluency with writing. In short, Elephant and Piggie (and the Pigeon) inspire, and inspired readers are fearless readers. Because my children believe in and love the voices of these characters and their friends (yes, there is a snake, a bat, a bird...), they are building their own voices as readers in order to spend time with these characters, and then extending that inspiration in writing.

One thing that is important to us is to be able to be portable. We want to share our shows with our community as well as other schools. The lighting system that we are trying to get funded is light, portable, isn't hot and dangerous, and is made up of new technology that is beneficial for our students, especially if they are planning to get into any part of entertainment or theatre. They will learn how to focus lights, change colors, fade in and out, design a lighting set up for specific spaces. They will learn what it means to be a gaffer, a technician, the artistry around lighting design, power, electricity and more. And of course what it means to put on a play and present puppets to our community. If we are able to get our project funded it will directly impact our ability to present a high quality theatrical puppet play. Our puppet theatre does not use a traditional Muppet style puppet. We are making European style puppets mixed with traditional Japanese Bunraku style. This means we have 2 to 3 students controlling each puppet. For them to come to life we need a controlled lighting set up to allow us to camouflage our actors on stage bringing attention to the puppets themselves. ","My students need a portable theatrical lighting set-up. This includes lights, cables, a controller, tripod trees and clamps to attach the lights.",Music & The Arts,Grades 9-12,Technology,1258.85,Fully Funded

When classes are in the computer lab, working on projects or skills building, the lab is noisy and students cannot concentrate or hear their own work and cannot complete the lessons. We are a small elementary school just outside of Minneapolis. We are proud of our diverse student body. Our students are eager to learn, love their classmates, and are truly enchanted by what technology has to offer. They love the opportunity to explore new tools and try new things, and I am amazed every day at what they can create on their own. Sadly, many of our students are children 'in transition' or are experiencing a difficult home life. Many of our students receive free or reduced rate lunch. Technology literacy would give them a leg up as they continue their education into the 'real world,' and I only want to offer them the best and most robust technology experience I can. I feel that the only way we can break the poverty cycle I see in my students is to give them tools and education that will follow them into adulthood. Our students are thrilled every time they get to come to the lab. Whether it's working on a Google doc as a group, or mastering a new math skill. However, our lab does not have a sufficient number of headphones for each computer station, and our students cannot afford to bring their own. Many of the programs we use in lessons offer sound to read aloud to students or ask questions for them to answer. Without headphones, the lab becomes noisy and chaotic, and students are unable to focus on their work. With a set of headphones at each computer, every student would have the opportunity to listen fully to the lesson, participate completely in the assessments, and even just use the headphones to cancel noise so they can work on their projects better. Having headphones would allow me to work better with students one-on-one because the room would be calmer and quieter and allow me to have more meaningful conversations with each student. By having headphones, the computer lab will become a better and more effective learning environment. Students will be able to focus on their assignments and work better, and have more time to complete tasks and learn skills. More experience with technology will give them a head start when they move into secondary education, and continuing education. They will acquire the skills needed to be successful in school and life.

They have come so far and we want to see them go even further. We have 12 students who have a wide range of abilities and needs. These students have been faced with a lot but never give up a challenge. These students come from different backgrounds. They enjoy coming to school and are always eager to learn. We just need more resources to help them be able to do so. Our school is a Title One school which means that 70% or more of our students receive free/reduced lunch. Kids with special needs tend to be very sensory. We see this a lot in our classroom. Our kids need to have sensory items available for them to hold and I will admit, I don't have a lot of these items available when needed. Our students tend to fidget and become unfocused after periods of time. Having these sensory items available will not only help to increase time on task but they will also help with behavior management as well. Some items will reinforce strategies taught during class as well. Students will be able to hold these items and be more focused on what is being taught. The sensory bar desk buddies will be an item for students to touch while doing their work. The letter formation tray and tactile sand numbers will help with students who are sensory and are still learning their letters and numbers. The sensory balls will be another item for kids to hold. The gel boards will help with the writing and the shoes will help with tying shoes. Donations will to this project will help our students to be more successful in and out of the classroom. Because of your donation, our students will be able to have more resources to help them learn in the classroom. When considering whether to donate to this project or not, I hope you will consider the students, their needs, and how much these items will help them to be successful.

Some of my students are better at math, others love science or sports but they all arrive excited and ready to learn every day. Everyone's learning has its own time-table. I have students who catch on like lightening while others who are just as enthusiastic need extra examples or some individual help. I have 11 who are new to the program this year so it would be very helpful to have mini-ipads available for the ones who finish early. They could visit webpages I have created for the class, play games in German or visit some of the many children's educational websites available in German while I work with small groups or individuals. Some of our families do not have Internet access at home so this would be a good opportunity for those students to experience using to internet to reinforce their learning. The amount of comprehensible input a learner processes is directly correlated to his/her level of success. In other words, the more German I can give them in meaningful and interesting ways, the better their proficiency will be. The ability to function in more than one language is certainly going to enrich their lives and widen their horizons at every turn.

My students and I have decided to do a monthly service project to give to those in need. I want to give back to my class by having this project fully funded this month. I teach 27 fourth graders in a fabulous school. Our mission statement states, 'We are building stronger minds, bodies, and spirits together.' I think this applies to everything we do. Each year our school makes donations to Make-a-Wish, Pennies for Patients, Animal Shelters, Zoos, and many other organizations. We are a hard working, dedicated, and caring community striving to make the world a better place one act of kindness at a time. We know that our actions will ripple throughout the community. Please bring some joy to your life and join us in our efforts! This project would allow us to create sign ups, share our community service pictures, and find more organizations in need. Thus far we have planned, blanket and food donations around the holidays, animal shelter donations, visits to a local nursing home, treats for our local heroes (police, firefighters, military), and care packages overseas. In order to complete all of these tasks, we are going to need this project fully funded. You could be a part of our ripple of kindness. We have requested items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, granola bars, and soap to make care packages to donate to homeless shelters. We have requested pre-made care packages with snacks for our heroes in our local community (police, firefighters, etc) and for our heroes overseas (our American soldiers fighting for our freedoms). We are truly grateful to have the resources to be able to provide these service projects to make our world a better place and bring a smile. There's no better feeling in the world! We believe that bullying doesn't exist when students are working together to better the lives of those around them. Each act of kindness is a small reminder of how we are working as a team to build a stronger community. And we do have to work together for this to succeed.

For them to be able to access the changing table independently, it will not only help them to feel more independent but will help save their teacher's back! My students are 3-5 year olds with special needs. I have children who are developmentally delayed, have Autism, Down syndrome and other disabilities. Many of them are not potty trained. I have 13 students, 10 of whom are still in diapers. However, my assistant and I are determined to make using the bathroom part of their regular routine. Many times throughout the day, we are changing diapers. Because the children are older, and some of them very heavy, lifting them to be changed is very hard on my back and not safe for the children. Having a changing table with a stairs will help my students with special needs be more independents with the diaper changing process and it will alleviate the stress of lifting them puts on my back. Stairs will also help the children be safer in the process of getting on top of the changing table. By receiving a changing table with stairs, I can encourage the children to be more involved in the potty training process which will hopefully lead to more students becoming independent with the toileting routine. A changing table with stairs will also prolong the quality of my effective teaching by alleviating stress to my back and having an overall better quality of life.

My students are K through 6th grade at an inner-city school in Minneapolis with a diverse population including Hispanic, African American, and Somali students. We are an Open School where students are taught to be critical thinkers and give their own voice to each project they embark on. Hard working, enthusiastic, and extremely joyful, they devour all arts opportunities presented to them. They LOVE to create and perform and jump at the chance to share their creations. 'Orff Instruments' (in this project, xylophones) are specifically designed for elementary and middle school use. Students not only use them to learn and accompany known songs and pieces, but more importantly to create their own arrangements, compositions, and solos. They are a fabulously accessible instrument that allows all students to participate in music making. They also help dramatically in differentiation- students and the teacher can tailor learning to the needs of each student by making the music as simple or complex as appropriate. Students will perform large pieces in an ensemble, accompany songs in the classroom, and create their own arrangements and compositions. The general music program at our school is being rebuilt from the ground up- we started the year with an empty room. With extremely limited funds we are not able to purchase these, or many other, instruments and classroom supplies. Ideally, someday we will have one instrument for each student in the class.

We have music for 30 minutes twice a week, and in that time, I try to have lots of movement and hands-on learning with instruments. I like to keep a varied curriculum that allows the kids to learn in many ways. The kids at my school come from many backgrounds.

My students will be able to learn rhythm with the rhythm sticks, we will practice different note values with music. We will practice writing them on the white boards and they can make their own rhythm patterns on their white boards using the markers. Using the scarves and bean bag activities will allow them to move expressively while they listen to music, especially when we study different composers and their music throughout history. Many games can be played with scarves, and they can also be used for musical story-telling. This project gives my students some basic supplies that are needed in our music classroom, as well as give them an opportunity to express their personal musicality through writing, moving, singing, and playing.

They're not in the best condition, but they get the job done. However, a lot of the bows that we're using are in awful condition. We don't even have any cello or bass bows, so the students must use violin bows to play those instruments. The four violin bows that I'm requesting will replace some bows that are beyond repair. These bows are missing almost all of their bow hair, which results in a not-so-beautiful sound. The four cello bows and two bass bows will be an awesome addition to the classroom, since we have zero at the moment. The cello and bass players are forced to use violin bows on their instruments, which does not help them produce a full sound. Also, there is a high risk of breaking the violin bow when using it on such a larger instrument. I feel that this will give my students more confidence in their playing. Finally having the right bows with the right instruments will make them feel like they are in a real orchestra.

We focus on those high school students who have never studied a culture in depth, and more importantly have never been given the opportunity to leave their hometown. Over the past six years, our small program has made it possible for students to travel and explore the globe. They spend the months before conducting independent research on a specific country under the guidance of college advisers from multiple participating universities. The experience culminates in a guided study tour of the country where students participate in hands on learning experiences designed specifically for them. This authentic form of learning has long been reserved for those who are financially stable. Although our students come from low income neighborhoods, they continue to prove how high achieving they truly are. The growth in their maturity is matched by their new sense of determination to further explore the world and make their own lasting impression. This is evident in their final research projects that not only are factual, but have a personal element to them as they implement personal accounts of what they saw and studied on their tour. As the program continues to grow, we would also like to have a logo t-shirt that will help us identify our students while traveling, and give them a sense of pride in the program that they have worked so hard to be part of. This year, a dedicated group of students will be traveling throughout Japan. Here they will gain first hand experience as they study the economic structure of an international superpower, compare the education system with that of our own, and strengthen their interview and public speaking skills by shadowing employers in a variety of markets, most notably commerce and technology.

My high school class consists of teens age 15 to 19 with moderate to severe autism. Instruction in functional academics and life skills helps students increase independence and prepare for real life situations. At times, though, a student's sensitivity to loud noises and other things in the general school environment and community makes participation in these settings challenging. For my current students, music serves as a universal soother. Although each student has different music likes, covering their ears with their preferred music masks other environmental noises and helps them function better in the various settings. Music also serves as a high preference motivator. With mp3 players, students can discretely take music on the go. With the players in their pocket and headphones on, students can increase positive participation in the school and community settings.

They enjoy books and interacting with the stories they hear. When I read aloud to them I can see the excitement in their faces as they become involved in the story. Reading quality books and stories aloud to my kindies is my favorite part of the day. I can't come to their houses and read to them, so the next best thing is books on CD to help increase their language skills. This diverse collection of books on CD will allow my second language students to self-select titles to take home and listen to. With these CDs and books they will hear fluent reading with expression, follow along in the book and increase their vocabulary and exposure to English. I'm excited for them to have an opportunity to be exposed to more stories read in English by including their home lives. With the recordable CDs I can increase my library of recorded books by transferring the cassettes to CD. The storage bags will help keep everything organized.

We want them to enjoy reading, for example, listening to books on CD and be able to 'mark the text' through the use of post-it notes. My students have a variety of diverse needs such as learning disabilities, behavioral concerns, cognitive delays, and other health impairments. In addition, we teach English Language Learners who need support in reading, writing, listening and speaking. They are attending an inner city public school in Illinois. We are working with students and their families so they can be be more involved in education and value it. We attend a variety of community events to gather information about their learning and living environment so we know how to best help them in the classroom while being sensitive to their needs academically and socially. There are many outside factors that stand in their way of education. Sometimes, it is survival/street smarts that is more important to them than their education. We want them to put education first, especially literacy, and be successful beyond these obstacles! With these materials, students will be able to be in cooperative learning groups to listen to the audio CD. Students will be able to be in guided reading groups with their own copy of the book. Students will be able to take the book home for re-reading purposes, finishing up lesson assignments and be able to read at their leisure to enjoy reading and make reading a part of their life with their families. With the novel guides, my co-teacher and I will be able to collaborate in order to implement Common Core Standards through a wide variety of literary elements. Due to this, students will be able to meet the standards. For the English Language Learners, we can make sure students are engaged in reading, writing, listening and speaking activities. For the diverse learners, we can make accommodations and modifications from the guide materials. We can engage all learners in our classroom to meet their multiple intelligences for a rigorous learning experience that meets their needs.

Dr. Seuss In my classroom, the children are all individuals. They all come from refugee camps in the area. Many have left their home country for religious or political freedom and have been in the country for less than two years. They speak eight different languages, none of which include English. Anything they have is donated, and they are grateful for what is given to them. A pencil to them is like an iPod to a child from a middle class school. We are a school that caters to low-income families from around the world. The children at this school bring a unique perspective to our world. It is very important for the children in my classroom to be immersed in the English language. They need to hear English spoken with fluidity. During my reading block I wish to have students working in different stations, a teacher-led, a volunteer-led, a listening, and an independent center. With a listening center my students will be able to be exposed to a variety of reading materials with minimal distractions when their headphones are on. They will learn about sentence structure, parts of a book, prosody, intonation, and a love of the written English language. The white boards will be used to practice phonemic awareness and how to spell the individual words that make up the sentences that in turn make up the stories they read. This class came to be as a result of the combination of two over-populated classes. When I arrived in late October, my classroom was four walls, nine tables, and 20 chairs. There were not any additional supplies to be utilized and so anything needed, I happily supplied.

Alice WalkerMy students come alive through the beautification of our school through gardening. As a veteran teacher at my high school, I wondered if beauty affected the learning process. This year I found out. I had an idea in my environmental science class. The students supported and jumped right in. Most come from broken homes and impoverished neighborhoods. Often times, school is the place where they can get away from their realities at home. Our school would be the perfect escape if they had something to look forward to. Our class is filled with seniors whom have yet to see their school at it's peak of success. There is a need for that success. As a teacher I wish for my students to bask in the beauty of awesomeness. I wish for them to start a legacy that will be passed on. I wish for them to return to their home and see how they have contributed to the success of their community. This starts with the beautification of our campus. Someone once planted some roses in our courtyards. The roses have not reached their full potential. Students will learn how to prune and care for our roses to make them thrive. We currently started a vegetable garden in a courtyard and used old planters in another area of our school to continue planting. We have been walking our water hose from one side of campus to another. A hose cart would be the perfect tool to make this process more efficient. Our water nozzle has broken and we are in need of another. We have been manipulating the water as it comes out of the hose by placing our thumb on the end of the spout. We are desperately in need of outdoor gardening soil and or manure. Our ground is not fertile. Students will learn the elements needed in soil to create a sustainable growing environment for plants and vegetables. They will also be able to participate in soil testing labs. Knowing that anonymous people are investing in their efforts will help change their attitudes toward people in life. The beautification of our school through gardening will allow the students to gain the hands on experience in agricultural studies. This will also be the catalyst of projects to come and future partnerships for our school as we move forward.

Throughout their lives they've been made to feel like learning is something that they never will be able to achieve, but they are passionate to prove those naysayers wrong. My hope with this project is to continue using an alternative way to engage my students in learning. Throughout my building, teachers are experimenting with technology as a way to reach some of our most reluctant learners, including students with severe ADHD. We are seeing tremendous success with unique forms of technology that students in our building have no opportunity to see at home. In our room we have 3 NOOKS and they are always being used.

In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the TEACHER is most important.' I could not agree more. As a third grade teacher and life-long learner, I encourage my students to explore and go beyond the walls of our classroom. My class of 13 boys and 11 girls is a lively one. This group of children is first kind and cooperative with one another. They set their personal academic goals, and respect individual starting points knowing our class objective is growth for all. Our school and district is quaint and clean. It is full of caring parents, staff, teachers, and administrators. We are not a wealthy district or community, but we make do. The kids greet me at the door each morning with a handshake and smile. They come ready to learn, yet teach me something new each day!The technology available to the students is limited and outdated. This restricts both my ability and theirs with regard to exposing and exploring all the wonderful things that lie beyond our little school, district, and community. Technology is not the be-all and end-all of education, but it can provide children with experiences that they might not otherwise have growing up in a small somewhat rural town. I am seeking an iPad with a protective case for my classroom. The protective case with 24 third graders is self-explanatory, but let me share with you the purpose of the iPad. Technology of today has opened the door to more resources than one can imagine for adults and children alike. On a daily basis, my children would be able to utilize various online literacy and math programs which are not available to them outside of the school. These programs support the struggling student, the 'average' student, as well as the student who is ready for the next step in their education. Having an iPad would allow more children the chance to engage in these learning opportunities. More importantly, an iPad in our classroom would provide children with the ability to listen to books while following along. This will build fluency, as well as expose the children to a wider variety of literature both fiction and nonfiction with their specific needs and interests taken into account. The addition of an iPad to our two classroom computers (each over two decades old) will not revolutionize my teaching, as I believe what Bill Gates has said, 'Technology is just a tool.

I am working hard to improve that situation by acquiring engaging formats like graphic novels and the TOON books. My school library is more than books on shelves. It is a place where students go to Think, Create, Share, and Grow! Cultivating resources that tie into creativity, play, and literacy will grow lifelong readers. I serve over 550 PreK through 4th grade students at a Title 1 school. Our diverse student body comes from six of the seven continents. They are joyful learners and readers that inspire me with their enthusiasm every day. Some have no access to the public library as their parents are not users. Many do not have their own books in their homes. Though they come to the library weekly as part of school, I am hoping to create opportunities for them to come after school and even over the summer. Library use improves literacy, curiosity, and life long learning. I am a big believer in graphic novels and other comic type materials. They serve to engage even the most reluctant readers - stories and characters that capture their imagination, illustrations that help facilitate comprehension and promote confidence in understanding. My husband was a comic shop owner. Many of his customers were people that struggled with reading until they found the format. With that passion, the time they spent in text increased and their ability and willingness to read grew exponentially. Many credit their academic success to their early passion for reading through comics. The TOON books I am trying to purchase will allow me to provide that same experience for my struggling students, many of whom are English Language Learners or receiving Special Education services. A circulating collection of these books for my library would put them in the hands of struggling readers. The TOON books are a new, fresh approach to giving new readers stories and characters they will engage with in a popular format. I can't speak highly enough of these books - I have three in my library already and they are never in. Adding to that collection would only serve to generate exciting about reading and the library.

I have told them that I want to inspire them. I want them to learn about a famous pop artist named Andy Warhol. I teach art to a wonderful group of k-5 students. They are sponges eager to soak up everything. When they see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know what the next art project is. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We have academic clubs and after school tutoring and daily academic pull-out programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements Andy Warhol was known for creating tomato soup can paintings along with creating art from everyday objects. I want my students to work in small groups. ESOL and ESE students will be paired within the groups. The groups will collaborate using books and iPads to explore the famous pop artist. Using critical thinking skills, students will discuss that everyday objects in life can be art. They will see the connections and need for jobs in the art field. Warhol was a commercial artist. They will be inspired from Warhol to make a creative new kind of soup label to market. The pencils and paper requested will help students write, discuss, and plan their work. The markers requested will help add the color needed for the designs. Perhaps it will be a can of Peanut Butter Soup with a dancing peanut. Maybe it will be Creamy Chocolate Soup. Students will enjoy learning about pop art, collaborating and creating a new pop art soup and label to market. I'm looking forward to sharing photographs. Students will learn about a famous artist and recreate his work in a creative way. Students will learn about commercial art and that there are many careers in art. They will learn that art is in everyday objects. By donating to this project you are helping bring enrichment and quality materials to the arts.

They need to see their futures can be limitless. This trip will help fuel those dreams. Seventy-five percent of my students are from a minority background, either first or second generation. Most of these students' families have no post-secondary education. Sixty percent of my school is receiving free-and-reduced lunch. A great majority of my students want to attend college, but they lack the family exposure to a wide variety of college or career options. These students have struggled to master the language of their new country, succeed in school, and adapt to their new home. These students have internalized the American Dream and long to explore the advantages that America has to offer. Many of my students see daily their parents struggling in low-paying jobs to make ends meet. These students long to break that cycle and move towards jobs that are both fulfilling and financially secure. They need exposure to new, exciting, and rewarding career options. My National Honor Society students will explore the Oklahoma City science museum with a guided tour that allows free time for students to explore exhibits that attract their attention. Once students have piqued their interest and realized the excitement that science can hold for them, they will be given a presentation on various careers that can be pursued in different scientific fields. Students will be motivated to take advanced courses in both math and science to equip them for college work. This trip is also coordinated with the school counselor who works intimately with students in supplying them with information about college choices including scholarship and grant materials. My students will be able to see how exciting science can be firsthand and hear stories about careers in scientific fields. They will learn that these options are within their grasps. This knowledge will improve their high school education as they are motivated into higher math and science courses and influence their college and career decisions. They will realize that they can have a career that is both fulfilling and important, helping them to attain their portion of the American Dream.

Some of the titles will be used in small groups-the Elephant and Piggie books are a ton of fun to use to teach expression when reading. A few of the books, like The Book With No Pictures, will be used as read alouds to model good reading and thinking during reading.

I want to build them up by showing that the more a person reads, the better he/she becomes at all things academic. My students come from an impoverished background and have faced much adversity, and I want to help give them a taste of reading success to propel them into productive, purposeful adult lives. My students will use these books as a part of an independent reading initiative I will be starting in the New Year. As a first year teacher, I am realizing that gaps in reading will only be closed by doing reading itself. Having a library will allow me to have books on hand for my students to be able to read both in and out of my classroom. By having high interest books in my class, I can visually promote reading and literature while also having an immediate means of making recommendations and starting dialogue around books my students are reading.

I have a small room that serves as an office and treatment space for children with communication deficits. My approach is to directly teach children the communication skill they need and then allow for practice and carryover through play with peers. My school has a wide variety of programs ranging from severely disabled students in both primary and secondary life skills classrooms, to the district level gifted program, in addition to a K-5 regular education elementary program. My caseload includes students with autism, selective mutism, intellectual disability, language disorders, and developmental delays. My project is specifically designed for those students with autism and selective mutism. I work with them directly on social communication skills which is very stressful and difficult for them. Many of them dislike school due to the anxiety caused by having to communicate with peers and adults. I have had success with having them come into the speech room with a buddy or two and complete puzzles, play board games or build with Lego's. My supply, however, is quite low and I am in need of a bigger variety of high interest puzzle and building toys to keep their engagement and enthusiasm up as well as their peers. With the addition of the puzzles and magnetic toys I've requested, my students will have more choices of what they can do with their speech buddies. The few items that I have used to date have allowed one of my students with significant anxiety related to autism and selective mutism to begin to build friendships with two other boys in his class. He is able to practice looking at others when he speaks, asking questions, initiating conversation, and being flexible when interacting with others. His mother reports that he no longer fights coming to school because he has something to look forward to every day before lunch. This project will allow my students to practice their communication skills, make friends and have fun while working on speech, social communication, problem solving, and language skills. High interest activities like I have selected will be motivating for them and allow for carryover of their skills in a more natural setting of playing with peers.

We will discuss and have a better understanding of the food pyramid. I have requested paper, markers, and mat frames. For the culminating activity, my students will draw themselves doing their favorite sport using the paper and markers requested. Some examples are: a gymnast, ballet dancer, ice skater, basketball player, baseball player, and swimmer. The finished pictures will be displayed throughout the school in the special mat frames requested. The pictures will serve as a visual reminder to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. Students will be challenged to make better food choices and increase physical activity. Since I teach in a Title I school, I am limited in resources and materials. I work with over 840 students, so materials are consumed quickly. Students will participate in groups researching, discussing and illustrating their favorite sports. They will learn about a healthy lifestyle. I will also challenge my students to keep a healthy foods journal and increase daily physical activity.

I am a first grade math co-teacher. This means that I teach anywhere between 65 and 80 first graders daily! I teach mainly in small group guided math stations. I also plan for daily independent math stations and 4 classroom teachers. My school is an urban school that has been identified as having many struggling learners. I am always looking for ways to make learning fun, exciting and engaging for all students. We are currently using white boards, dry erase markers and erasers to have students explain their thinking when solving math problems. The Boogie Board eWriters will allow us to accomplish the same goal without the waste and cost of the markers. The Boogie Boards are extremely motivating and will help those students who are less engaged. It encourages a more hands-on approach to learning. It will also facilitate my teaching because I will spend less time on distributing materials and more time teaching content. Your donation can help improve my instruction. The Boogie Boards will encourage students to show their thinking in a variety of ways. They are much more student friendly than paper and pencil or even white boards. The continued cost of markers will be eliminated. You will help give my students a fantastic and memorable year!

We struggle with many of the same issues all urban school struggle with: full classrooms, tired teachers, not enough supplies, frustration at the lack of support, gang related violence, the many faces of poverty... But that is not what defines my students!!! My students are bright young individuals who deserve access a thriving educational environment which is full of rich literature. I am building a new course which will focus on race and ethnicity and their meanings. We will explore their role in shaping our identities. The texts will be used to examine racial and ethnic inequalities in the United States, the nature of racism, discrimination, and stereotyping. My students will use these texts as an inspiration to explore their own race. They will first be able to read about others' experiences through their biographies, poetry, short stories and first-hand accounts. We will then have class discussions and write our own reflections about our own experiences both as they relate to the text and as they relate to our own roles in society. Text such as 'Letters to a Young Brother' can be used as open and honest inspiration as well as a starting point for discussions such as: why are these letters written? who they are written to? what do they hope to acheive? We will discuss authors' historical background and intended audiences for each work we explore. These text will bring exciting textures and and voices to our class.

My students are early readers that have shown such enthusiasm and eagerness in learning how to read. As the year has progressed, I have watched in awe as some students entered my classroom with a minimum knowledge of letters, and now they are beginning to read books independently. They are learning how to sound out words and use their knowledge of sight words to enter the early stages of reading. This time of the school year is always my favorite time of year! Now that my students are given the tools to begin reading, their love for literacy really skyrockets!I work at a Title I school with many students coming from socioeconomically disadvantaged households. Despite any challenges they may face at home, I can always count on seeing their bright and cheerful faces when they enter the classroom. We have truly established a warm, welcoming community that encourages others to try their best and to never give up. We also hold ourselves accountable to high expectations. I believe one of the most important tasks I have as an educator is to provide a wide variety of books for students to choose from in our listening center and classroom library to promote literacy. When students have choices in what books to read, they are more likely to become lifelong readers. The book selections that have been made will increase the variety of our classroom library. Donating to this project will provide students with literature as well as non-fiction selections that pique their personal interests. My hope is to keep the students interested, excited, and eager to learn in the short year I have with them. These new additions to our library will help me achieve that goal.

My school is located in a rural area. About 80% of the students qualify for free lunch. My school is small and diverse. We have two teachers per grade level. Many of the students don't have access to the Internet, so it's important for me to bring as much technology as possible into the classroom. My students are an awesome bunch and come to school each day eager to learn. The three mini iPads will be used in a center where my students can go and use the iPads apps for extra practice on numerous of math skills. Students can also use the 'Show Me' app, which records and writes, and students can explain their work to the class via video. This video can be shared with other students in the class as well as added to the digital portfolio to show parents. Students can use Comic Life to create step-by-step instructions to math problems. This donation will help in differentiating instruction. The iPads offer access to numerous apps that meet the needs of the diverse learners in the classroom. iPads also offer virtual manipulatives for the math classroom.

The students are happy to be back, but many of my students are embarrassed this time of year because they cannot afford the supplies needed to complete the year successfully. I am a 4th grade teacher of 32 students. The school I teach at is an elementary school in a high-need community. The students attending this school are in a low economic community where they are not able to afford school materials. This leaves the students in need of support from others outside the community. With the basic school supplies such as scissors, pencil boxes, colored pencils and glue, my students will feel empowered to succeed throughout the 4th grade. Having tissues ready for those runny noses, will make them feel more welcomed. Starting the year off right is a huge step toward their success.

My students need more hands-on experiences, particularly with measurement in math and science. My students are curious and engaged learners who love learning with hands-on activities and games. Our school is in a high-poverty area and students often come with deficits in background knowledge, literacy, and real-world experiences. Our students love to come to school every day and take pride in their school and their learning. The most memorable and valuable lessons for them are ones that use real-world activities to connect to their real-life experiences. For example, having measuring cups will help students understand the concept of whole, half, and quarter when we follow recipes in math as a way to cement the concept of fractions. My students struggle to connect math and science to their daily lives--and across the curriculum. I had a student this year ask me why we were doing math during our science block! Measurement is an easy way to make those connections, yet students come to me with a poor understanding of concepts such as fractions, length, weight, and volume. Materials like a balance, scale, measuring cups, and thermometers will help us in our daily math classes and in our physical science units. We learn about weather and heat transfer, so the thermometers will aid in experiments measuring temperature. The scale will give students opportunities to measure the mass of substances before and after an interaction, and better understand the Law of Conservation of Matter. I will use the balance to help students understand the concept of balancing an algebraic equation so they can actually see and feel when you change the quantity on one side, you must adjust the other side to keep the equation balanced. For better or worse, standardized tests are a big part of public education. I know that having these measurement materials will help students dig deeper into math and science content, giving them a more firm understanding and helping them be more successful on tour End-of-Grade tests. Having tangible experiences with measurement will help students connect abstract word problems and science scenarios to their actual experiences in the classroom.

The sight, the sound, and the feeling are tremendous motivators for students. When played together, drums require students to work together and the payoff is immediate: an energetic, expressive sound. Drums provide unlimited opportunities for experience with rhythm, ensemble playing, movement, improvisation, meter, and timbre. Drumming also provides teachers with the flexibility to assign parts of varying difficulty to players of different abilities. Moreover, the ensembles provide an invaluable social experience because the players depend on each other for the group to succeed. No matter the grade level, drumming is a powerful tool to build teamwork, discipline, and excitement.

I have been able to adapt our classroom, but recess is different. Our school doesn't have toys to meet their needs. All of my students, kindergarten through sixth, have severe special needs. They struggle to overcome hurdles their disabilities have given them, both academic and behavioral, but when they succeed, they shine. It takes specially trained staff, individualized curriculum, designed instruction, and adapted materials to teach my students. Work may be difficult at times but watching my students learn is worth every minute. With help, they can and will succeed.

Through collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving is what they need to have to thrive in today's society. My biggest challenge in getting my students there is our lack of technology. My students represent 5 different counties in the Western Carolinas. Some families have chosen to commute long distances to be able to attend our school. I know a family that travels almost an hour very morning to drop there child off by 7:30am. They are excited and vivacious and eager to learn! But most importantly, they believe in our school. My school is a new school that opened August of 2014. It is a year round, collegiate prep school that believes in educating the whole child without the demands and anxieties of too much testing. The teachers are creative, energetic and has taught on very little resources, furniture or curriculum. Yet they are happy because they are also vivacious and eager to teach! Our school has built a community where everyone loves to be there and learning is rigorous. Through the use of the 8 Apple iPads and iPad protectors, my students will be learning Literacy Skills through technology. The Apple iPads will primarily be used inside my classroom through Kindergarten Literacy Center time where I will enforce their literacy skills through apps that enrich alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, reading and reading comprehension. With a splitter, each iPad will be used with 2 students at a time collaborating together to enhance these skills. The Apple iPads and iPad protectors will also be used for class intervention groups for at risk students in Language Arts and Math inside my classroom. The students will practice grade levels standards that are connected to the common core that they have particularly been struggling with. With this extra piece of intervention I will be able to guide our students to become more confident and successful in their educational career. '21st-century skills' is generally used to refer to certain core competencies such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving that advocates believe schools need to teach to help students thrive in today's world.

They make connections between Literature and Nonfiction, and what is happening today, in the real world. We debate, discuss, and infer together, and everyone is encouraged to 'show what they know'! Our school is unique because we are a public school but gifted, regular, and disabled students all attend classes together and there are lots of opportunities for cross grade interactions. It is normal to see students of all ability levels playing basketball with two students in wheelchairs, or a 4th grader teaching a 1st grader to sound out words, or how to design a catapult! Some 4th grade students visit 5th grade once a week because we do what is best for kids. We are an IMPACT Academy, that stresses Problem Solving and Positive attitudes, and as the front of our school announces, 'All students are welcome at Garden Grove!'. This year we will have 35 students in each of two fourth grade classrooms. We want to extend our Literature Circle book sets to include a Science Fiction genre (When you Reach Me), a realistic fiction (Because of Winn Dixie) and a Historical Fiction (By the Great Horn Spoon). Since we only receive about $100/year for books & supplies, these extra book sets, and art supplies of paint, pencils, paper and pastels are critical for our extension projects to provide readers additional ways to revisit what they've read, and continue the conversations and discoveries to create even more meaning. Game Boards, CD Covers, Character bookmarks, collages, ABC books, commemorative stamps, accordion books, paper story quilts and salt dough maps are some of the planned projects. Extra kids mean extra books and supplies needed! No one should be left without a book or art supplies! As more and more students are packed into our classrooms, we sometimes forget the power of one book-one student. While it is true students could share novels, there is something magical about curling up on the rug with your own book, reading at your own pace, and getting lost in that literary world for a while each day.

They've never truly found a book they are inspired by, or a book that offers a strong role model that makes them want to know more about themselves and the world around them. I want change! My traditional English students are in 8th grade and have tried to find many creative ways around not doing real work so that they can 'slide by' and not be noticed. They 'fake read' because they don't know who they are as readers and they no longer care about stories or the heroes that lay within the pages of a novel. I have a large percentage of energetic students curious about history. I have students with low reading scores who would never consider 'reading' on their top 100 hobbies of 'after school activities'. My school's largest demographic category is low social economic status. I believe every child can learn, but that they need the right tools. I believe that the adapted young adult book 'Unbroken' can be the very book that changes their reluctance into sizzling energy. Olympian Louis Zamperini spends a difficult 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. 'Unbroken' is the story about resilience of the human mind, body and spirit, and can give inspiration to students and teach them the value of perseverance. Students will engage in literature circles and will discuss the major events in small group settings. Students will not only write objective academic summaries, but will, but will cite evidence that proves Zamperini is a hero. Students will also draw inferences about the main character to support their opinion and establish a formal writing style by doing so. Overall, the book will inspire struggling readers to read more, and to write more compelling essays that challenge them to cite evidence and to use logical reasoning in their essays. If I can get one student to love this book, I may have perhaps caused them to become life long readers. If I can do that, I have created a critical thinker. I've helped create one more soul dedicated to becoming a stronger citizen all by having read a book about a tough American hero who refused to give up. I can get my class talking about historical issues, and real people who turned crisis into an opportunity to prevail. I believe 'Unbroken' is that one book.

Science students should learn the importance of safe lab behaviors such as cleaning hands and equipment. Students otherwise need to leave the room to wash which interferes with the investigation and supervision.

We want to further our students' experiences by allowing them to access educational applications directly through the Internet. Our students are here at INVEST Collegiate in order to take part in a whole child educational experience. Instead of focusing solely on test scores, our mission is to raise the bar for every student by exposing all ability levels to higher level thinking skills and tap into their individual strengths and interests. We reject the one-size-fits-all educational construct and focus on social, emotional and physical well being as well as academics. Having iPads in the classroom will allow us to create centers where students can take turns 'playing' on educational applications at their own personal ability levels. They will also have access to a variety of books beyond our limited classroom budgets. Teachers can also set up specific WebQuests with a list of URLs so that students can research specific topics on their own without being exposed to search engines. Having Internet access simply allows students to go beyond the classroom walls and be exposed to unlimited free resources available to teachers and students. The incentive aspect of including technology into any lesson is that the iPads improves attention and motivation to learn.

Being able to love reading can open a person's mind to things they never knew and I believe that every student deserve the opportunity to have that experience. Our school is very diverse, therefore we have many students that come from different backgrounds. We have a lot of military families, low poverty and high poverty, single parent families or no parent families, homeless families, and a big population of Malti-cultural families. Because of this our school is extremely community and family oriented. We want to do everything we can to make sure every student is being included and feels safe and able to learn. One thing I have noticed is either students love to read because they have access to do so, or students hate to read because of their inability to do so. This inability can come from a lack of access to reading materials outside of the classroom. I want students to be able to use the kindles as another way to read books they love. I also would like to use the camera's on the Kindles for projects or QR Code's during in class assignments. I believe that it is important to have technology available at the students fingertips because that is where this generation is headed. My hope is for students to be able to access reading in a different and meaningful way with these Kindles. They will allow students with sight impairments and English Language Learners to read with a font that is best for their needs. Also, English Language Learners will have access to texts in their language and at their level. I whole heartedly believe these will help students that struggle with reading, find a way to not struggle and see the possibilities they have to be great readers.

Nowhere is this more apparent than when young children are absorbed in a game that is actually teaching them the basics of computer coding. My students are bright and eager third graders that reflect the rich diversity of our community. We are a wonderful mix of racial backgrounds, home languages, and ethnic backgrounds. Approximately forty percent of our students receive free or reduced lunches. Although some of my students have access to computers at home, many do not. They are all eager but, even at third grade, it is easy to see the beginning of a developing digital divide. This iPad and keyboard will make it possible to set up a coding station in my classroom. The kids will be able to use applications that disguise the logic and skills of coding as familiar games. These games are highly motivating and teach students the basics of computer programming while fostering perseverance and problem solving. Since the interface with the iPad is so intuitive, students with very little computer experience will still be able to access the applications and develop coding and basic computing skills. Having an iPad with a keyboard to use as coding station in class will give all students equal opportunity to explore the critical beginning skills of computer programming. It will also help give all of my students familiarity and confidence with computing. Although we are a small school, we strive to provide enrichment and those special experiences that make students want to come to school and learn. This coding station is a high interest, highly educational activity that will make students eager to persevere and learn skills that will serve them well into adulthood. It will also begin to bridge the digital divide that is already beginning to develop.

18ad63856fee034bc5acc88868f7cd53,Chromebooks for Bright Students,"My students are excited every time they get to use technology in class. Last year, my 5th graders used Chromebooks across all disciplines, but we had to share a tech cart with multiple classrooms. I want to expand my students' ability to do this kind of work this year but we need more Chromebooks. Our school is a microcosm of our community; our diversity spans culture, heritage, and socioeconomic status. Half of my students qualify for free and reduced lunch, which means their families are living below the poverty line. Our district continues to invest in technology opportunities and now all students have Google accounts and we use Google docs to share our work. We have recently upgraded our broadband, and teachers an take technology-focused professional development. However, we still do not have enough computers in the classroom. Currently, shared Chromebook carts are stored in the library and have to be checked out by teachers and moved from class to class. This is not only a waste of time, it is also disruptive to the teachers and students. We want to improve the technology experience for our students in the most efficient way possible, and having enough Chromebooks is a simple, cost-effective solution. My students will use these Chromebooks for learning across many disciplines. Last year, using the shared Chromebook carts from the library, we did research, wrote poetry, created Google slide show book reports, and used Khan Academy and Arcademics to provide individualized math instruction. With more Chromebooks, we can reach more individual students and increase the amount of learning happening in our classroom. This DonorsChoose grant is part of our school's overall strategy to utilize a variety of funding sources to achieve our goal of a Chromebook on every student’s desk. We will use the Chromebooks to do research, create reports and projects, and work on individualized math activities. My students will also learn basic skills such as typing and navigating the internet, especially since several of my students do not have access to this at home. This project will make a difference in the following ways: Individualized Instruction: my students will have the opportunity to receive individual math problems to solve, e-books to read, and websites/topics to research using technology. Publishing for a Real-World Audience: my students need to see themselves as authors and creators who have valuable things to say to real audiences.

Math needs to be hands-on and active. Children need to work together to solve problems and persevere. Gifted math students need to be pushed and challenged. Our school is in Clark County, Ohio. We are classified as a 'rural fringe' school. We serve about 950 students in our Elementary, grades pre K-6. 42% of our elementary students are low income and we are a Title one school. My students have been identified as gifted in Mathematics. They come to me every day for their math instruction. They are so much fun. They love to learn and still get excited about new activities. I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I would love to have Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They would also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. Students could build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class will inspire teamwork, encourage perseverance, and promote a positive attitude towards solving math problems. Learning to persevere through problem situations is invaluable to my students. For most of them, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated. I want them to experience the true self-esteem that comes from sticking with hard problems. These are lessons that will carry them well into college and life.

Creating a multi-genre classroom library with popular books is what I'm hoping will be the key to unlocking a life-long love of reading for my students. I have the best students in the whole world! OK, well I am admittedly biased. While they are not the highest socio-economic level, they are hard working and goal oriented. Most of my middle school students want to go to college and work toward that goal. Many of the parents have a college background, and those that don't work hard to keep their families comfortable. Unfortunately, we don't have a great local library and parents don't always have the opportunity to take their kids to the library to get the books that they want. Our school places literacy development very high in our academics and we want our students to improve their reading levels each year. We have a designated 30 minute period 4 times a week where students are expected to read to work toward this goal. Our district has had a multitude of budgetary woes in recent years and one area that has been hit hard is in our libraries. We just don't have the number of current books available to meet the students wants. I can't wait to stand at my bookshelf with a student and have a conversation with them about books! Often times a student will not know what to read and I have to fly somewhat blindly when suggesting books that they may enjoy. With a well stocked library we can actually look at, pick up, and peruse through potential books to read. Students participate in book talks weekly, which helps others to add to their queue of next books to read. If I have many of these books available to the students it would help to increase the number of books that they read. Furthermore, we are going to be having Literacy Circle units this year where students will read multiple books from a specific genre. This allows student to have thoughtful talks and discussions on specific genre traits, theme and plot development, as well as how characters and setting work to move the plot and theme along. Kids need to have books available to them if we are going to ask them to read. The flip chart easel and Post-It notes will also help. Not all kids are readers. Often kids 'hate' reading because they haven't found the right book(s) for them. If students have a variety of genres, subject, and lengths of books I am confident that this can help to tear down the 'I hate reading' wall. I've seen students blossom when they have a chance to talk to their peers about books. With a well stocked classroom library I know that students will read more, increase their literacy and ultimately foster a stronger knowledge base.

Several of my students do not have access to technology at home, and their only interaction with the iPad is when they are in the school building for technology twice per week. My class has 3 ESOL (English as a Second Language) students as well as several students that are gifted learners that need access to hands-on, up-to-date technology. Our school is a small community school. There are 22 students total, all with varying learning styles. Technology is not readily available in the classroom, and students struggle with the use of the little technology we do have. Each day we do small groups and technology is always difficult because of the lack of computers that are accessible and functioning for students to use. iPads will be useful in the classroom, because students will be able to have access to a technology that actually works. We can use the iPads to perform class projects and stem activities, research and as center activity for reading, language arts and math. The literature center activities will provide small group practice of the literature skills students need to master. It also provides more opportunities for them to do independent work building their confidence. My project will provide students with resources and technology they need to become college and career ready. With the increased rigor that our students are faced with they must have the adequate resources to help them be successful. iPads will be useful in the classroom, because students will be able to have access to a technology to make connections, conduct research and be familiar with technology.

This could be the year that magic happens for my students. I want my students to become critical thinkers and show growth in all aspects of their lives. I believe all children can learn despite their various backgrounds. My students are a group of 19 eager learners in fourth grade at a Title 1 school in an urban area. Having the opportunity to have their own personalized learning devices this year, heightens their interest for learning tremendously. My students are of diverse backgrounds and of varying academic abilities. Using personalized learning devices allow me to differentiate instruction for all and tap even more into higher order thinking skills. Assisting my class in obtaining styluses and earbuds will help maximize their learning in the classroom with their iPads. Each child will obtain the opportunity to learn at his or her own pace during guided math , guided reading and in other subject areas such as science, social studies and health. Students will use the earbuds to listen to instructional videos at their level of instruction. Since my students are of varying mathematical abilities, I plan to create videos to meet their needs. The students will need the earbuds to listen to the videos to reinforce concepts taught or listen to new concepts introduced. They will also use them to practice their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts. This will provide them with the automaticity they need for more challenging math concepts . The styluses will be used for assignments in Popplet, Book Creator and in Google Classroom. Students will also use both the earbuds and styluses as they complete research projects in Science, Social Studies and English Language Arts. For instance, as students brainstorm ideas for their personal narratives, the styluses can be used as a tool to input their ideas in Popplet. Students lives are made better as learning will be taking place with the integration of technology and on their level.

Let's Turn Reluctant Readers Into Lifelong Readers,"Some kids walk in the library and get lost in a world of words by finding books that help their love of reading grow. Others walk in the library and simply feel lost. I want to provide books that invite reluctant and/or struggling readers into the world of reading and help them stay there for life. Our students live in a rural area in the Midwest and attend a small high school of about 650 students. Many of our students come from homes in which their parents or parent is struggling financially. It is a lower socioeconomic area that has been hit hard by economic struggles, job loss, and state budget cuts. Despite these obstacles, our students remain positive and continue to strive for success. Most importantly,they maintain pride in their school and community. More specifically, the population of students for whom I am writing this grant needs extra guidance in the area of literacy and reading. Whether they are struggling readers due to ability level, are learning English as a second language, or are reluctant to read because they haven't yet been exposed to reading materials that ignite a desire to read, the bottom line is that they need books that invite them into the transforming experience of becoming lifelong independent readers. My goal is to transform how our reluctant and struggling readers interact with books and reading. I want to work to transform those kids that feel lost when entering the library into kids who get lost in the wonderful world of reading and books. I hope to do this by providing titles that are at their reading level and more importantly, books that mean something to them. We can all create dependent readers when we assign books and book projects in our classrooms, but that doesn't mean our readers will continue to read once the project is over or when they move on from our classrooms. It also doesn't mean they have learned to enjoy reading. I want to provide Orca Sounding and Orca Sports Collection books that will help students learn to select materials they love and inspire them to read more, not just materials that will help them fill an assignment requirement. Ultimately, I want to provide students with titles that will motivate them to read more, which will help boost literacy skills and create confident readers for life. My overarching goal is to make reading more enjoyable to reluctant and struggling readers, so that they can become better and more motivated students in every classroom. Providing students with manageable and interesting titles that they can relate to can change their lives forever. When students read more, they do better in school and in life. They are healthier emotionally and intellectually. When you're a reader, anything is possible. Please help our students realize this.

Eager to learn, discover, and create, the students are also excited to be able to design, code, print, and ultimately hold their own ideas in their hands. Before even receiving a 3D printer and just by creating this project, the students are learning about planning and marketing. The students began with researching 3D printers in order to determine the best printer to meet their needs. As they develop this project together, they are also working as a team to market and spread the word about this campaign so that it is successful. Once the students have received this 3D printer and filament, so many more opportunities will be open to them. From learning to code and design their own projects and inventions, to the problem-solving, and persistence required to refine their projects, the students will be able to develop the hands-on learning experiences needed to increase their STEM awareness and 21st Century Skills that are so necessary to their future. Our goal is to make our ideas and projects come to life with a 3D printer. The addition of a 3D printer to the Academically Talented program will allow us to actually apply our learning in real ways, rather than just through discussion or writing.

Our kids have a strong desire to learn and challenge themselves, despite the hard challenges they face at home. Westwood Primary School is an inner-city school located in Phoenix, Arizona and educates nearly 1,000 children in preschool through third grades. Ninety-eight percent of students qualify for federally subsidized free or reduced-price food services, a national indicator of children living in poverty; and 26% of students are English Language Learners. In using these whiteboards my students will be able to use them during whole group and partner learning. We will be able to work on math or reading skills together, where they are able to learn in a more hands on way. They will also be able to practice their fluency and comprehension skills using the reusable cards, while also saving paper. We will also be able to create anchor charts for our learning by using the chart paper and markers. All of these items will allow my students to be more successful and my teaching more effective.

My school is a K-8 option school in our district that parents choose for their children. As an alternative school we attract students with a wide-array of learning styles, interests and backgrounds. We have many students who are diagnosed with Autism-Spectrum Disorder, Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD. My students love learning, but many of them still have difficulty staying focused during instruction and work times. Sitting for hours a day can be not only challenging for some kids, but can actually negatively impact their ability to focus. My special needs students in particular need to be able to move their bodies to be able to focus. Wobble chairs are designed to support children with ADHD and Sensory Processing Disorders because the chairs offer a physical challenge that provide sensory input as well as give students the opportunity to release extra energy while doing their schoolwork. Students also need to be able to listen during instruction. Fidgets that keep hands busy are proven to help students with ADHD focus. Having different seating choices that allow for movement will give my special needs students who need it a tool that assists them with their focus. Fidgets will help them focus during instruction.

They are two of the Outdoor Adventure Club class officers, and they want to make this year's trips 'the best ever!' I was amazed at the way in which they developed the project. All the officers of the Outdoor Adventure Club stayed late after one meeting and brainstormed all the trips they would love to take, but we simply can not afford. Once someone hit on the idea of going on a zip line, everyone was talking at once. I told the students about Ramblewild - an outdoor ropes and course with obstacles that meander from tree to tree at various heights through the forest. Two students took the lead. I gave them the questions from DonorsChoose, and they worked collaboratively over google Docs. to create the project. Ramblewild will give students the three hours helping each other climb through the trees to strengthen their bond and their belief in their own abilities. It is an awesome way to teach teamwork – all while challenging their limits in the outdoors! Students cannot maneuver from one obstacle course to the next by themselves. They must rely on each other to map out routes, plan each method of traversing the course, and stick together. This will require empathy for one another and group problem-solving as the courses can be quite difficult. Students will learn about sustainability. The 10-acre adventure park is owned by Feronia Forests, a corporation which encourages landowners to develop sustainable income opportunities, rather than using their land to harvest lumber. Ramblewild is an Eco-friendly adventure park high in the trees of a hemlock forest. All of the elements of the park are attached to the trees using tension, rather than bolts or screws, so the trees remain unscathed. Project Help Us Get To Ramblewild is about attracting teenagers who are not invested with nature and introducing them to it in an exciting and heart-pulsing way. Ramblewild is the trip that is the medium between being completely away from society and being a city kid. By writing this grant, we are taking a step forward as leaders by partly funding the adventure and becoming more beneficial members to the club. With the help of our fellow officers, we will facilitate a means to getting the job done efficiently and elegantly. News of this trip has already peaked the interest of many teens. The club does not sell itself to everyone. For most teens, any time away from modern luxuries is like a detention. We want to show teens the joy of nature and the connection we once had with it. We want to share the feeling of accomplishment from scaling mountains and many other things while doing it all together! The group’s main focus is to build a unified community inside the school of which we can all have at least one great memory in nature together.

With TNReady and MIST being in full swing this year, I want my students to be as prepared as possible to take the test on-line. The school has a recent reputation of failure, but the students work hard every day to prove the naysayers wrong. While they all show interest and ability, over half of my students come to class each day unprepared to learn mathematics. Though they come unprepared, what they soon realize in my class is that math can be fun and interesting if taught the right way to fit their interest. My students' main interest...technology and using it in the class. My students generally love my class because of the different avenues used to teach them. With the use of an iPad, it will allow me to differentiate even more! The iPads that I am requesting will be used to allow students to be able to determine an appropriate course of action in solving various Geometry problems. TNReady is based on letting the students work through situations based on questioning and answering and discussing different ways in solving a problem. I feel that an iPad not only allows the students the opportunity to become familiar with the test and how it works, but also it is a fun and easy way to learn math with the many apps that are available. In order for students to be successful in the work force, they need to be able to think analytically, have a creative and innovative mind, USE TECHNOLOGY, and have the curiosity and imagination to take them further. These skills can all start by using an iPad to manipulate problems and how the outcome changes just by touching the screen.

We need a new table to remedy our situation! Eighty five percent of the students attending my school qualify to receive free and reduced lunch. My 3rd graders come to school everyday because they know it is a safe place where someone will protect and care about them. They come from broken families, or parents who work multiple jobs just to pay rent. It is hard for them to continue their learning at home because parents are working hard to make ends meet, or they simply don't have any materials to work with. Due to this fact, many of them are below grade level, and struggling to get caught up. To help my students, we work in small groups on a regular basis. We gather around our table for reading, math, and writing just to name a few! Unfortunately, sometimes the small group is eight students, and we have to sit at a table made for six (if even)! Students don't have space to put all of their materials, much less enough space to put their arms on the table and write comfortably. With this new table, there will be enough space to seat eight students. Plus, the table is scalloped, so each student has their own area. This will cut down on time moving, adjusting our chairs, and figuring out how to fit everyone's material on the table. We'll be able to get so much more work done, and continue learning!

My classes will then transfer what they've learned about the children's books to write their own book. This is the third year that I've done this activity and it's been the single most completed assignment that I do. My students develop their own characters and story line. They create a story for an elementary student that they would like to tell. My students write and illustrate their own children's books. They become authors! Once the books are completed, my students visit the local elementary school and partner with a younger student to share their book. The books are then given to the younger students for their classroom library. This activity builds such confidence in my students and helps them to see that they can make a difference in their world through helping younger students. This project will give my students the confidence to believe that they can do something to help others. This will be another step towards their goal to be successful in 7th grade this year.

My students have been identified as gifted in Mathematics. They come to me every day for their math instruction. They are so much fun. They love to learn and still get excited about new activities. I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I love having Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. With the addition of the cubelets students will build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class inspires teamwork, encourages perseverance, and promotes a positive attitude towards solving math problems. For most of my students, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated. I want them to experience the true self-esteem that comes from sticking with hard problems.

Over the years I have watched the kindergarten curriculum increase in its educational requirements as the common core standards for students leaving kindergarten have soared to very high heights for our youngest learners. The curriculum lessons and expectations for reading, writing, and math, provide little time to focus on the importance of the 4C’s of learning (collaboration, cooperation, creativity, and communication).

Our youngest learners are eager to learn, I simply want to design a positive learning environment that will help make their educational journey enjoyable. Adding round spacious and comfortable tables to the classroom will allow the students to work both independently and collaboratively. Students will have their own space to keep their materials better organized which will help make their learning endeavors more productive and successful. In addition, the round collaborative feel of the tables will also allow many opportunities for the students during group activities to communicate with each other and create collaborative projects.

The students have at least three competitions a year, and three separate concerts. These events put us in front of groups who have $100,000 funding every year, in front of judges from all over the nation, and in front of proud parents. When our students show up in the best of what clothing they have, it is often still not what the group needs to look professional. Their attitudes are of winners, but our clothing makes us look less than we are capable of. As well as playing like professionals, please help us look professional. I am requesting thirty-six Broadway Tuxmakers Men's Adjustable Black Tuxedo Pants with Satin Stripe. These pants will be paired with our dress shirts, bow ties, and vests, completing our look. The kids will look and sound like one million bucks! When we go to our next competition, looking like a group playing a professional concert, the kids perform different. They feel different about themselves. They come from extreme poverty, homelessness, broken families, and do not have the resources to better themselves or their appearance. Every time we are able to provide them with new resources we see a change in how they think about themselves, and what they can accomplish. Help our kids feel like the winners they are!

Students like Yency, Marissa, and Jovana have worked to change the climate and culture in our school and the results have been outstanding! Our student leaders have really gone above and beyond. Our school is fortunate enough to have a Chromebook cart available for use, the only problem is that there are not enough Chromebooks for all of the students to use at one time. My kids thought that having our own Chromebooks in the classroom would be beneficial for those times that the Chromebook cart is not available to us. We are a school of immigrants and refugees, oftentimes we receive students who are unable to speak English. As such we use the Chromebooks for assignments, research, and extra help. Students are also responsible for assignments and projects that are to be accessed via their student emails. For those students who do not have a computer or internet access at home having the Chromebooks in the classroom allows these students to access all of their materials as needed. Working to put this project together and make it come to life will allow the students to work on multiple skills necessary to succeed in all that they do. Putting this project together has shown my students the importance of working hard to accomplish a goal as a team. They have also worked on their grammar, spelling, and math skills. As we sat down to work on the 'shopping' portion of this project, the students compared prices for each product before deciding on what was best for us. As the girls sat down to write their essays there we multiple revisions before they felt as though their answers were perfect. We would like to have more technology in our classroom. We want to make sure that we and our fellow classmates have the technology we need to do our school work and prepare ourselves for high school and eventually college. Many of us do not have computers or internet at home. By having computers in the classroom we are able to complete homework, work on projects, and even apply to the high schools of our choice. Since making this project come to life is so important to us, we have thought of several ways we could make this project happen. We know the key to success is advertising the project as much as possible, so we will talk to our friends and family about donating, we will post it on social media, we will put up flyers, and we can even get our Student Council involved! This project is important to us personally because we get our education from this school, and we would want to get the best out of it and do as much as we can for our education so we can succeed in high school and beyond. It is important for our school, because these chrome books will be used for years and years to help students get the most out of their education here at Kilmer.

For this reason the students access to technology is varied from students to student. That being said all students no matter the background, care deeply for the environment and wanted to find ways to help sustainability and boogie boards was one of the suggestions. The students will use the boogie boards on a daily basis in place of white boards for showing and representing work in the class. Currently the students use white boards about 2-3 hours of the day during work time, which leads to wasting marker and other classroom resources. These boards will help students in my class have easy access to simple technology. They will also benefit by helping the environment by using a more sustainable option in the classroom.

Every day I am impressed with my students' musical abilities. It saddens me that, due to the low income area of our school, many of these students do not have the opportunity of exploring their talents outside our music classroom. Therefore, I believe it is so important for me to give them as many experiences and paths to explore and refine their inner musician as I possibly can! I love using music to create connections to literacy. Students who connect and create memories with books in the music classroom will be more likely to read on their own. Adding music to books is easy! We simply look for opportunities to implement sound effects within the story. We then assign these sound effects to unpitched percussion instruments to bring the text to life! Building up our selection of unpitched percussion will give us limitless options when adding sound effects to children's literature. Strengthening my students' love for music and reading, as well as helping them realize their talents, is what we are all about at my school!

There are 12 students who come to school everyday excited and ready to learn! But what I love most about them, is that they never let anything stand in their way! They have a range of diagnoses, all which make reading a bit more challenging. The thing they struggle the most with is literacy. If there were more hours in a day, we would have more time to read with our children. Unfortunately, this is not the case. ALL children need to be exposed to texts read aloud to them. This listening center will give every student in the class this special opportunity. They will be able to follow along with the words as they are read to them. This will help their phonics skills. Listening to a story also allows them to hear how fluently a book should be read. In addition, they are spending less time decoding the tricky word, which allows them to build their comprehension skills. If our class had a listening center, each student would have the opportunity to hear stories read to them. Not all of the children have someone at home that is able to read them stories.

It is a children's story consisting of music and text, spoken by a narrator and accompanied by the orchestra. My students have not had this type of exposure in the arts. Students will listen to the following instruments from the selection: flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, timpani and bass drum. Peter represents the string instruments: violin, viola, cello, and bass. The Wolf is French horns. They will draw an animal or feeling from the selection with the paper requested. We have been discussing musical instruments in the classroom, so this unit will have meaning. Students will see the video of Peter and the Wolf.

I want to let my students express themselves through the arts by playing the key board, bringing music and joy to their lives. I am the music teacher at a Title I school. Since we are Title I, almost all students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch and are entitled to many other services. For many years we were limited in the music department and lacked instruments. Now music, art, and PE programs have been brought back. My students are extremely sweet and eager to learn. I also have instituted a chorus program after school for additional music exposure. Many of my students have limited opportunities in an enriching music program and I want to provide many different opportunities. 'Empowering Students Through Art' by using a keyboard and incorporating other subjects like: art, music, reading, writing and so much more is what I would like for my students. I work closely with other teachers integrating Common Core strategies. Fluency, vocabulary and reading will improve by having students sight reading songs in correlation with the keyboard. I am trying to build a Keyboard Center in my music classroom. I want students to have the freedom to express themselves through the arts. Students will play, listen, draw and color on paper how the music makes them feel at the Keyboard Center. Many of my students have limited exposure to musical instruments and art. I want them to have access to a well rounded program. Studies have shown that learning musical instruments and art helps to increase reading and math scores. It helps with concentration and focus.

Do you remember rolling and pressing your fingers in the clay? The smell of it? Do you remember creating your first clay pot or clay creation? I want my students to have that same exposure too. I want them to create clay self-portraits. I teach art to a wonderful group of k-5 students. They enjoy art and are little sponges. When my students see me in the hallway, they stop me and want to know what the next art project is. We are a Title I school, which means, most of my students receive free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school. We have developed a recipe for success. We strive to help meet the needs of every student. We provide additional materials and health services. We provide backpacks and uniforms for students in need. We have academic clubs after school, Saturday School, and daily pull-out academic programs. These additional programs have helped our students and they have done well on standardized tests. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. 'Empowering Students Through Art' is what I want to do. My students will use the white model magic clay requested to create self-portraits. I will start with a story called 'I Like Me' by Nancy Carlson. It's a wonderful story about liking yourself and focusing on your best qualities. We will have a classroom discussion about the book. Students will be directed to make connections from the story to art and health. It helps promote positive self-esteem, healthy eating, and healthy choices through art. After the story, students will be given a mirror to study their facial details. I will show them the proper technique of creating their clay faces in proportion for this unit. Students will learn the technique of scoring when placing facial details of the eyes, nose and mouth on the oval clay face. Once the air dry clay dries, students will get to paint their faces using the acrylic paint requested. There are many colors for the students to choose with these paints requested. Using a story, this unit focuses on having a positive self-esteem, making healthy food choices and decisions with daily living skills through art. Students will learn proper techniques of pinching, rolling and scoring through a medium of clay. Students will get to paint their self-portraits using acrylic paints. This unit is needed for my students since many of them come from single family homes. They have limited exposure to clay and this will help build self-esteem.

They can embellish with jewels, which they will use their imagination with. They will call the jewels diamonds, rubys and pearls. Students will get to role play and write a story about if they were King or Queen for the day what would they do to help people. We will also have a discussion about who wore crowns and that it represented royalty. Kings and queens were also leaders. The watercolor markers are a wonderful medium for my students to work with. They will enjoy designing crowns and embellishing with jewels. They will also write and discuss what they would do if they were king or queen for the day. We would focus on the character trait on kindness. My students will discuss the connections of being kind, doing positive things, and being helpful through this art and writing activity.

They have already been brainstorming of all the many ways they can put these tablets to use, and I have been impressed! I asked them what they would love to have available to them on a daily basis in class that they do not already have? I put them in groups to collaborate on this topic. Each group came up with some ideas, then had to persuade their classmates to support them. After every group presented their idea, the class overwhelmingly agreed with the group that thought of Kindle Fire Tablets. I have many students in class who depend on their love of reading to help them learn about the world outside of our small South Arkansas town. Having easy access to the Internet and especially thousands of books to download will allow them to expand their worldly culture, and learn about themselves in the process. I am eager to use the video capabilities available on the Kindle Fire tablets, to allow my students to work collaboratively on projects to present to their fellow classmates. I feel they will learn about the content I want them to learn about while also learning about teamwork and technical skills at the same time. Megan- I am an avid reader, and I often get discouraged at the selection of books available to us in our library. I would be thrilled to select my next book from the Amazon store. I know that many of my fellow classmates would agree with me. Bailey-I have a lot of big ideas about presentations that my classmates and I can work on together if we have the technology that this tablet could provide us. This could help make learning more accessible and interesting. Katie-I hope to start a book club with my classmates for the new books that we will have access to through the use of these tablets. I am hoping that Mrs. Matthews will allow us to meet in her room some days during lunch to do this. Adam-I want to use the tablets to start a video blog for our class to think more about what we have learned. This could be a much more exciting twist on our traditional Writer's Response Notebooks. This project would give all of the students at our school the chance to read books they may not get to read without these tablets. Our small town residents can be exposed to books not currently available in our library. I can hardly wait to discover even more exciting ways to use these tablets in our class that we haven't even thought of yet!

The are now eager to take these projects to the next level - from simple 3D objects to programmable, functioning robots using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. From the day they started working with the 3D printer, my students have been brainstorming what they can print and make. Printing simple objects has been interesting, but they are eager to tackle more advanced projects and challenges. They have seen fully, functioning robots using 3D printed parts programmed with controllers like Raspberry Pi 2 and the Arduino Uno R3, and decided this was the next step they wanted to take. Through the combination of our existing 3D printer and the programming capabilities of the Arduino Starter Kits, my students will be able to learn and apply their knowledge of coding to real-world situations. They will be able to work cooperatively as a team, designing and printing the parts needed to construct their robots, and then program their robot to complete a task. According to Eric, 'Our project is to expand our engineering skills and our knowledge of electronics customization by obtaining two Arduino Starter Kits and two Raspberry Pi 2 Starter Kits. Combining our 3D printer with these kits, we can create a balanced, electronics driven curriculum that inspires ingenuity and opens minds to the vast world of robotics, programming, and the creation of objects that can change the world.' This project is important not only our class, but also to the classes and students below us. We understand that we will be leaving this school at the end of this year, but we also understand that this project will not only benefit our learning during our last year, but will benefit the younger students in the Academically Talented program. This project will solve the main obstacle we currently face with our 3D printer curriculum. We are able to print nice objects for projects, but we are not able to use those objects and parts to program working electronics and robots. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi will allow us that next step in our engineering learning.

We, as a school, are working very hard to get them on or above grade level. This is a big challenge, but we care about the students' futures. Technology will help us get there! My students are great! We are always working on a classroom environment where everyone feels loved, valued, and respected. They work hard at school despite some challenges that may be at home. A lot of my students come from the Flint area, which means that running water would be a luxury for them. My students have so much potential to make a big difference in this world, and we are trying our best, as a school, to help them see that. Our school not only cares for our students but also their family and community. Technology is sparse at our school because our Title 1 money is spent on interventionists because our students are coming to us way below grade level. We recently received one iPad from another DonorsChoose.org project, and my students have loved every second of it. If we could have another one in our classroom, we could double the students that could use it. We will be using the iPad in a lot of areas but really focusing on reading and math. My students will be reading a wide variety of books which brings the library to them. My students will also be building their basic math knowledge that is the foundation of math to come. My students like to know that people care. When I told them we had received an iPad for our classroom, they were so excited. I'd love to share that we got another one.

We all perform a warm-up together to get our minds focused on music. Then we learn a new music concept and apply it to our music that we are preparing for a concert. Our school is a 6th-8th grade middle school educating around 780 students. Our population is 91% Hispanic, with 92.6% Socioeconomically Disadvantaged and 39.1% are English Learners. In order to reach these EL (English Learner) students it is important to provide real, relevant and challenging music lessons to provide a well-rounded education where the arts are included in their everyday curriculum. Students will use their imaginations to create music which will help them with self-expression, problem solving, and collaboration. I admire Disneyland Create to INSPIRE my students. My students who play clarinet and saxophone will have the reeds they need to physically play their instruments. One reed only lasts a few weeks so for every student that plays a reed instrument, I need to provide around 10 reeds per year because I teach in such a high poverty location and I cannot ask my students to purchase their own reeds. The disinfectant is for my students that play trumpet, trombone, and baritone. They would use it on the mouthpiece to clean it and keep germs from spreading. With the worksheets my current and future students will be able to learn about famous composers and listen to compositions. Then they will be able to study musical terms and show their progress using the assessments in the book of quizzes. With the Finale program, I can create customized music for my future and current students to work on specific lessons throughout the year. Also anytime I need to rearrange music to work better for my students, I can easily create it using the Finale program. Students in my classroom will learn how to perform music on a band instrument for a hands-on education that builds individual and teamwork skills that will be helpful today and for the rest of their lives. Studies have shown that learning music uses both sides of the brain and helps with math skills that will make them better students at the high school and college level.

Our tables are heavy and bulky, and take time to push to the walls, losing either valuable academic time, or limiting the sensory break. Smaller desks will be easier to move if necessary, or by just taking up less floor space, we are going to create more of an open area. Working with students on the autism spectrum, it becomes necessary to create an atmosphere that is uncluttered. The open floor space allows for less congestion, and less distraction.

I would like to provide them with a stool so that they stop pushing back on their chairs, which is unsafe. I think that stools would help with this problem. Thank you for helping out my kids. I appreciate it greatly. My students need stools chairs. For my students, the basic chair is not always useful. I would love to see none of my students push back on their chairs. I would like to be able to have the option to allow for those that can't stop, to have another alternative. This would help me as a teacher greatly. I would love the expensive wiggle chairs, but those would be something everyone would want and they are very expensive. For my kids a small stool could make all the difference by allowing them to be safe at all times in my classroom. I would also appreciate it since I worry about them hurting themselves and don't want to make them stand instead. A stool is a great alternative to my daily dilemma.

Students are reading about various types of plants, experimenting with seedlings, and creating a landscaping plan to be voted on. We have a store donating dirt, and now we need a gift certificate to purchase plants. A master gardener speaker will explain to us the different types of plants, and what might be good go our traffic circle. Students then will do further research into the plants presented, and vote on what kind of plants they would like to include in community traffic circle. They will have to take into consideration the city's restrictions for height, and develop a landscaping plan. This project will help students know that they can make a difference in their community, and develop pride for their neighborhood. Currently, the traffic rounder is full of weeds and some trash.

The students, even though they have challenges at home, are happy to come to school and determined to participate in learning. In today's technology, fast paced, standards-based driven educational world, the demands on students as learners is higher than ever. However, in my particular classroom (and many other classrooms in my building), the students are knowledge hungry and not afraid to struggle to improve their learning. The students in my room need to read a variety of complex texts for multiple purposes. The students also need to find evidence to support their learning. Having the evidence kits will help my students read nonfiction and fiction text while being able to find key details, compare and contrast, summarize,discuss vocabulary and find the theme for multiple grade level texts. During the school day, we will use white boards for multiple reasons and in multiple subject areas. With the white boards the students can practice their work and show their thinking. Students also hold up white boards in whole group lessons so the teacher can get a snapshot of learning and understanding to provide more intense intervention/small group time when needed.

These six and seven year olds are learning to read, have become writers and have made big gains in math. We are busy all day long, and there's still much to do. My students are in first grade, and enjoy coming to school. They come from a wide variety of living situations. Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. Some of my students live with families that do not help them with their homework, or who appear not to be supportive of education. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives. I am asking for five Kindle Fires kids Editions. These come with a free year of Amazon Free Time Unlimited and a kids proof case. We will be able to use this for reading and math practice. There are many apps available such as books that are read to the students to help them learn fluency, and math games that can reinforce skills taught in class. I plan to use these during reading and math groups.

If you don't practice reading, you cannot develop your literacy skills. I work with students who need access to books in their native language, so they can read, as they learn English. My students are middle schoolers in 4th though 8th grades. All are immigrants from other countries, are learning English, have relocated to an inner-city urban area, and are in an over-crowded school. Most of them are Spanish speakers, and come from families who have limited or no English speakers as well. Most students come from low-income families and qualify for free lunch status. The literacy skills with which they arrive to school vary from very beginning to highly developed. They are still expected to read and keep up with the classroom curriculum, however, and this is very difficult to do in a language they are still in the process of learning. My students are eager to learn and wish to adapt to the culture and language quickly. This is why I need to provide them with access to quality literature in a language they understand. My school district has frozen budgets, which means I am very limited as to what I can purchase for my students, though they need instructional materials. Students will utilize these books to check them out for independent reading, as nightly reading is required as homework. Independent reading at one's instructional level will develop many reading skills, such as comprehension, synthesizing information, questioning, inferencing, summarizing, fluency, and accuracy. Additionally, independent reading will develop students' vocabulary, even in their native language, and this knowledge will transfer to and enhance their English acquisition. Students are often asked to respond to their reading in writing, and frequently they must refer to their texts, but if they cannot truly comprehend what they read because of a language barrier, they will not continue to develop any literacy skills at all because they do not have appropriate materials to use. Books for my students will improve their literacy dramatically, since I only have a modest collection in varying levels for 15 limited-English students. Our school library has a very limited selection of Spanish books too. Students are expected to read daily in class and for homework, and the small selection that I have compiled is not sufficient for these students' use throughout the year.

Sadly, many of our Muslim students are bullied. I hope to use the book Ms. Marvel to teach our non-Muslim students that Muslim students are no different than any other student. Since the story’s protagonist is Muslim, I’m hopeful that Muslim students will feel a sense of pride as they see an aspect of themselves represented in the curriculum. Conversely, I’m hopeful that the non-Muslim students will learn respect and tolerance for their Muslim peers. Once individuals learn to look beyond outward differences, they start to see that the similarities we share as human beings are far more important.

Students are so excited when they can watch their peers act out what they are reading or when they can participate in the actual play. The use of props will excite students and the classroom. We additionally need a few more copies of 'Shakespeare made easy.' With extra copies of the play students can take home books if they miss a day of class I need to make up work. Students faces light up when I bring in props from home, but it will be even better if these props can belong to my classroom and be used for multiple pieces of literature.","My students need crowns, fairy wings and veils.",Literacy & Language,Grades 9-12,Supplies,362.4,Fully Funded

Almost 50% qualify for free or reduced-rate lunches. Many of our students receive services, including ESL, special education, and academic intervention. Despite the many obstacles my students face, they are hardworking, passionate, and enthusiastic about learning. My students working on this project love taking ownership of their classroom with student-led projects. We have received a ton of supplies and technology through DonorsChoose.org and they are so grateful for all of it. When they see a need for something and know there is an option to take an active part in their classroom, they do with DonorsChoose.org. Our class is broken up into 6 cooperative learning groups. Each group has its own supplies for various activities, lessons, or projects. They have scissors, glue, tape, crayons, markers, calculators, and their interactive science notebooks to keep organized. One of my students suggested to me to get something that can hold those supplies and keep them organized and easily accessible. My students are learning real-life problem-solving skills. They realized that our current system of staying organized with our supplies was not working. They brainstormed and came up with a great solution for the problem. They are learning to become responsible for their materials and learning to maximize their time. We need to organize our supplies. It takes away from our class time to get, use, and clean up our supplies. Many of our supplies get lost or broken when they are left at our group tables. It would be nice to have baskets at our group table to help oragnize all of our supplies so they are easy for us to access and use. We will take the lead by helping Mrs. Pitkewicz get this project funded. When the materials arrive, we will help her open all the boxes and oragnize the supplies into the baskets. The baskets will hold crayons, markers, glue, and other supplies. We will also help our classmates get and stay organized with this baskets. This project will help us get our groups get and stay organized. It will help keep all of our supplies neat. It will decrease the amount of messes and supplies getting lost or broken.

The additional laptop will add to our growing classroom set of laptops. This will be more more devise to get technology in the hands of our students. The goal that I am trying to accomplish with this project is for students to be able to have computer access, and be able to use the computer for factual information related to school work. Also, the computers help students who don't have access to cellular devices and might not be able to use data in school. Having a cart for the computers to be secure would be great because that way they can be locked up when not in use.I am excited to do this project with Mrs. Bauer because I want students to have access to to different sources of what they could use to research school work.

The students at my school have a love for learning and a great deal of creativity. They are very active, and they are always ready for an opportunity to show their 'colors'.

Collectively, they ask 100 questions before they even manage to sit at their desks. “What are we doing today?” “Is it lunch time yet?” “Do we have math this morning?” I quickly catch on to what type of question will come from which student, and the best way to answer it to satisfy the eagerness. The individuality of my students is evident from the easy questions in the mornings to their learning styles that lead to their academic success. At all different educational levels, I provide rigorous lessons as well as tutoring for those who need extra support. Primed for learning, my fourth graders are passionate about their work. I am a part of one of the fastest growing districts in our county because families move here so their children can attend quality schools. The quality schools allow me, as a teacher, to design a unique learning environment tailored to support unique learning styles. If student motivation and higher engagement is truly what my goal is, then I must adapt right along with my students in my classroom. I've noticed over the years that most of my students cannot sit and learn in a conventional classroom so I've found that some of the immediate benefits of flexible seating include using up excess energy, improving metabolism, increased motivation and engagement, and creating a better oxygen flow to the brain. I want my classroom environment to be conducive to open collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking. This simply cannot be done when kids are sitting in rows of desks all day. I teach and live in a great district that provides for their students but new concepts are at the expense of the teacher until they are proven to be effective.

Over 90% of my students receive free and reduced lunch. They are eager to learn and love to read and experience new things. Having the opportunity to use their own personalized learning devices this year heightens their interest for learning tremendously. Despite the challenges my students face in and outside the classroom, my goal is to make every learning opportunity count for them. This project will help motivate my students to not only enjoy and participate in learning but also assist them in retaining information learned. The novels will be used to integrate reading and social studies which will allow students to get a deeper understanding of the content taught and at the same time, deepen their reading comprehension. Furthermore, the headphones will help meet the various needs of students while using personal learning devices throughout instruction. Students will be able to use headphones to listen to instructional videos to enhance their learning and use styluses as they take notes and conduct research projects. Since many students have different modalities by which they learn, obtaining an opportunity to learn at their own pace will be highly effective. Therefore, students will love attending school which will boost their confidence leading to successful individuals.

Many are stuck living in small apartments with a large family and no yard to run around in. Several of my students have ADHD as well. It really is a struggle and constant battle for these students to be in a classroom without moving much throughout the day. Many students constantly struggle with having to sit still all day long in the classroom. Often times they end up getting in trouble because of it. However, these stools give them the ability to rock and constantly move. I have personally sat on these stools and loved them. It is nice having the ability to move around even if it is just a little bit. I would eventually love to have an entire class set of these stools.

You must have experiences or a great imagination to become a great writer.

They are always grateful and so eager for every extended opportunity provided.I attended a Tots and Technology conference this summer and saw the amazing Boogie Boards for the first time. No longer would there be a need to have smeared mini whiteboards that are hard to read. Or no longer would we have to waste tissue, paper or sponges trying to create erasers. No longer would I have to try to figure out what is attempted to be written, because students are trying to write with dried out dry erase markers or write on boards that have been used to the point of blurriness. With the Boogie Board, students would have an opportunity to express themselves without having to worry about if it's going to be understood.

My students enter my classroom every day full of questions, hugs, stories, and laughter. They are a resilient, hopeful, joyous bunch and I truly believe that they deserve the world.

Just this past spring, the largest employing industry in the town closed causing a huge loss of employment for our students' families. Many times our students are not able to participate or be offered the same opportunities as their peers in our district because of their low socio-economic background. However, our students and their families did not lose hope and stood behind our band program. We opened the program up to grades 5th through 8th and had almost 100% show interest in participating. However, many had to be turned away because they were unable to rent instruments. The majority of our parents were willing and excited to have their child learn an instrument, but were unable to afford the cost to rent or purchase an instrument. The bell kits will be given to students interested in playing percussion, but that would be unable to participate in band because of their inability to afford the rental fee. Our students have loved the two Pbones we received from DonorsChoose last year and we have one student that is still in need of a Pbone. The reeds are a necessary accessory for our clarinet and saxophone players and need to be replenished each year, especially as our numbers continue to grow. Our band program will continue to grow in numbers and spirit as more and more children are able to participate without the worry of monetary obligations.

These purposes include: math problems, making tables to help with math, instead of scrap paper during tests, practicing drawing shapes, practicing spelling words, writing sentences, and more. It will also help me as an educator to do informal assessments quickly and efficiently by asking students to write an answer on a board and then quickly showing me.

Therein lies the power of the classroom, and any teacher worth their salt knows that forming a community--particularly a reading community--is the foundation to a great year. My students are bright and willing, but need assistance in terms of literacy resources and experiences, which is why I am constantly on the lookout for great books to read together. Most of my students come from families with two working parents. As a working mom with two children of my own, I often lament my family's loss of reading time to the demands of just making it through the day. Reading, in my opinion, is mistakenly considered a solitary activity. You may take the words in through your own eyes, but I believe so much is lost if you don't share everything that happens after that--the joy, surprise, confusion, frustration and reward of reading good books. I want to create these opportunities in school, for this is what creates lifelong readers. If my project is funded, my students will participate in a genre study of historical fiction. Students will be able to chose an historical novel that interests them and read in small groups of 3-4, while together we will use our selections to examine the genre and its traits. It is important that students are exposed to and immersed in many kinds of print and many types of literature. A genre study is one way to accomplish that. I chose the genre of historical fiction as one way to support history standards. Our past is too vast and complicated to be covered in one history class per year; reading historical fiction not only brings the past to life, but it also exposes children to parts of history that may not be covered adequately in their course of social studies. Additionally, my students will read primary sources and informational texts associated with the time-preiod of their chosen novel, which adds another element of genre exposure (fiction v. non-fiction). Ultimately, a genre study will allow us to not only enjoy historical content, but also to 'compare and contrast a fictional portrayal of a time, place, or character and a historical account of the same period as a means of understanding how authors of fiction use or alter history.'

With more choices for markers, pencils and paper, my students will have things that they need to fulfill so many of our classroom lessons in both Reading and Social Studies. We use many supplies on a daily basis, like glue and colored pencils, in order to differentiate with the wide range of ability levels in my classroom. We often paste vocabulary words, graphic organizers, and other questions and answers into our journals. Teachers are only allotted so many supplies from our office and some of the supplies are of very poor quality.

We have lots of working parents who aren't able to come in to volunteer due to work or who aren't able to send in things, but we have great parents who are supportive of their kids' education. My students need headphones so that they can hear the various sounds that accompany the educational websites that they visit to help support their reading, writing, and math skills. We also need a wireless keyboard and mouse so that I can easily facilitate students viewing educational videos, using PowerPoints, and playing educational review games from the front of the room.

My students participate in small group and individualized lessons throughout the day that focus on promoting their strengths in order to address their weaknesses. The students in my classroom love to attend school and have great attendance! They love to learn and experience new things. In my classroom, we focus on personal growth and celebrate meeting academic and behavioral goals. Every morning we take a moment to dance and celebrate each other by handing out rewards or giving personal compliments to one another. This small activity sets the stage for the rest of the day. It puts all the students in a good mood and creates a positive learning environment where students celebrate each other. My students and I would like to ask you to donate informational texts to our classroom library and writing materials. We currently have a classroom library that has many great books, but it lacks non-fiction literature. The research shows that informational text can help improve literacy skills in students. The informational books that we are asking for are leveled from B to H. It will be text that students can read with the teacher or independently. My students need help strengthening their writing skills. The writing materials in this project will help my students transfer their reading skills to their own writing. My classroom is also in need of different flexible seating options. My students would love to curl up with a good book on some soft seating. Flexible seating helps students feel more comfortable and safe in their learning environment. It also promotes speaking and listening between students.

It is our pleasure to be able to teach these skills to our students, however, sometimes we need help providing all the things we need to help our program run smoothly. Technology is a huge part of our world today! Unfortunately, many of our students do not have access to computers and laptops outside of school. We spend a majority of time helping students fill out applications, completing resumes, and helping students write cover letters. Each classroom in our 4 teacher program has 4 computers, however, at any given time 1-2 may not be working properly. Having a set of Chromebooks would allow our students to work on their job skills and academic skills at their desk, all while gaining experience using technology. Finally, many of our students use read aloud or other software to help them understand the words on the screen. Over the years, our headphones have become worn out from many years of use. A classroom set of 10 headphones will replace the old and broken headphones and will be used for students to listen to read alouds and to play music for calming purposes. It is very frustrating to not have enough headphones when needed. Students will borrow other students headphones and forget to return them.

These six and seven year olds are learning to read, have become writers and have made big gains in math. We are busy all day long, and there's still much to do. My students are in first grade, and enjoy coming to school. They come from a wide variety of living situations. Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives. Last year my class was blessed to receive five Kindle Fires through the generosity of donors through Donor's Choose. I am happy to report that these Kindles are used on a daily basis. Due to an increase in class size, I am requesting another Kindle to allow each student the opportunity to use this technology more frequently. It comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time Unlimited and a kids' proof case. We will be able to use this for reading and math practice. There are many apps available such as books that are read to the students to help them listen to fluency, and math games that can reinforce skills taught in class. I plan to use these during reading and math groups. This donation of a Kindle Fire and accessories will allow my students to practice important academic skills and be exposed to using a touch screen, building their technology skills too. The memory cards will allow more storage of educational apps and allow me to differentiate the technology easily. The headphones allow each child to have an individual experience, and keeps the noise level down in the classroom so that I can conduct small groups. We are coming to state testing, and again this year it is a computer based test. This will continue in the years to come, I'm sure of it. These materials will allow the students more time with technology, and will help prepare them for tests, as well as giving them time to practice reading and math activities. Some students have little or no access to technology in their homes, so the practice at school is critical to help them prepare to show what they know on the state assessments.","My students need more experience with technology, this Kindle Fire and accessories, will help improve their reading, math, and technology skills.","Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Technology,426.16,Fully Funded

In a nutshell, Expeditionary Learning provides students with an interdisciplinary education connected to character and community. An integral component of a student’s education at our school is through “Learning Expeditions”, in-depth studies of a compelling topic tied to literacy standards. These Learning Expeditions go hand in hand with field work experiences within our local community to further investigate and explore real world connections. We think our third grade students are extraordinary minds working to solve these real world problems. With 87% minority students, 68% of the students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch, new immigrants from Mexico, Syrian refugees, students in transitional housing, and a multitude of languages spoken, our students bring their insight and diverse background experiences to the problem solving table. We believe that these students are changing the world. Our dream is for our entire third grade to attend an overnight three-day program at the Keystone Science School in the mountains of Colorado. This project will cover a portion of the cost of this field trip. This Spring, our third grade students will be engaging in a three-month long learning expedition to explore our urban watershed and nearby creek’s water quality, and come up with a plan to take action in our community to improve the quality of the Creek that runs along the back of our school. Our creek is part of a larger watershed, one that begins in the mountains and ends in the Gulf of Mexico. By engaging in the learning at the source of our watershed, students will gain the knowledge to understand water on a global scale. Our dream is to have our students work alongside scientists at Keystone Science School to learn the necessary background knowledge and skills to tackle water issues. This three-day experience at Keystone Science School is pivotal to shaping our students into scientists. We will take this content back to the classroom and our nearby creek, making connections between the world around us and our community. Most of our students have never been to the mountains, despite the close proximity. This fieldwork experience will broaden their horizons as scientists and world changers.

Our classroom library just doesn't have enough books at the lower levels these kids need. The collection of books I am requesting includes informational books about topics of high interest to 2nd and 3rd graders. While high-interest, the books are at a lower reading level so they can be accessed by all students. My students will use these books during our daily Reading Workshop. The sets will be used for guided reading when the students will receive reading support in a small group from a teacher. The other books will be used during independent reading time so children can read about topics that interest them. Students will gain confidence as readers as they learn about this wondrous world we live in. These nonfiction books will help them be engaged and excited about reading!

The students at my school have a love for learning and a great deal of creativity. They are very active, and they are always ready for an opportunity to show their 'colors'.

0c4df44a688cc024f2552f4653dae23d,"Cold, Clean, Filtered and Green: Water Bottle Filler Fountains!","Recently, three students, Azriel, Madeline, and Deiny approached me from the School Wellness Council proposing we raise money to get new water fountains in our building. Water is something many people take for granted in day to day life. However at our school, water is a common complaint amongst our students. Many of our students opt to not drink any water during the day rather than drink the warm tinted water that comes from our water fountains. The students at our school come from low-income homes making it hard to fund projects like this even though new water fountains would greatly help all of the students and staff in our school. The students have classes such as Physical Education that involve physical activity and staying hydrated is important. The students at our school spend all day working to ensure that they pass their classes and have a future, yet they are unable to have access to clean none the less cold water. Hydration is essential to life. Sadly, our students don't take the time or have the desire to properly hydrate themselves during school. The reason is simple. Bad water. The students hate drinking the dirty, warm water that our school water fountains provide. The students will have a better understanding of how important water is to their learning and health if they had cold, clean, filtered water at their disposal on a daily basis. The water bottle filler fountains also provide a green, waste free option which will help the environment in which the students live. Understanding how important it is to drink clean water and how important it is to save water, will give our students a better understanding of how they can help others who are in need of clean water and ways they can conserve and waste less. We are trying to get three cold filtered water bottle stations (one on each floor of our school) installed at our school. As members of the School Wellness Council our responsibility is to find ways to make our school and community healthier. Drinking clean, filtered, cold water throughout the school day is one way we want to help our community and school. Plus the water stations are waste free and thus saves our environment in the process. We are planning on selling water bottles for the Parent Teacher Student Association that will help raise funds for the PTSA. We will be responsible for collecting the money and promoting the use of the water bottles in the new water stations. We will also be educating our peers in the importance of staying hydrated throughout the school day. This information will be created and given during a school wide event by us students in the School Wellness Council. We believe that since our peers don't drink the school's water they instead are either drinking the 'sugar' free sodas provided in our school's vending machines or they are drinking nothing at all during the entire school day. We believe that providing water bottle stations that produce clean, filtered, cold water will increase the amount of water our peers will drink. This will keep them healthier and also provides them with a FREE drink option that is better and healthier than what the vending machines provide.

We just don't have enough. Physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited. My students learn best through singing, movement, speech, creating and performing on instruments so increasing the amount of instruments will increase student learning and understanding.I teach 600 students in grades K-5, and they come to me for 45 minutes once a week. My school is a Title I school in a military town. Military families many times will move away due to orders or deployments, but often return 1 to 3 years later. Students at my school are eager to learn and are most excited about performing on instruments and creating and performing their own compositions.I use a variety of approaches to teach concepts in my classroom, however, the majority of my classes are taught through the Orff approach. Students learn through exploration and creating. With this additional barred instrument, students will be able to contribute to the creation and/or performance of a piece of music and help to accompany other students who are singing or performing on other instruments. Currently, our classroom only has three out of seven bass bars. Because of this, the bass bars do not get utilized as much as they should. While adding one more instrument may seem insignificant, having one more Orff instrument (bass bar) will allow more students to participate in an activity. This will reduce time and the number of groups switching out on instruments.

Despite this, our school has a vibrant campus culture with clubs and activities going on during lunch and recess most days. The rallies and athletic events are well-supported and well-attended.

A single functioning electronic balance added to the room can halve that line to 6, if my other two balances are working the lines drop down to 4.

Flexible seating invites creativity, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. Many of my students have trouble staying focused. Having multiple options for students to work at, aside from sitting in a basic chair or standing, is one way that helps my students to stay super engaged and on task.

Their academic limitations create many academic and emotional struggles. These students experience high levels of frustrations. This can damage their confidence, willingness to try, and connections with peers. Our school focuses on the academic as well as emotional needs of our students. We work to creatively present lessons in a highly structured small classroom environment. Students travel from all over the county to attend school somewhere they feel understood and a sense of belonging. . The materials that I am requesting are therapeutic work books. They are designed to provide creative ways to present lessons help motivate students to strive through their struggles. I work with many of these students throughout their formative school years and want to continue to provide fresh innovative ways to assist them in becoming their best selves. Different messages reach different students so continuing to build my resource library allows me to the best chances to reach all the children that I work with. My lessons developed through these resource materials work to build students motivation, confidence, mood regulation, and healthy interactions. Children are taught to work through their frustrations with schoolwork and classmates. They learn to have courage and overcome the challenges presented by their disabilities.

I strive to provide my students with the most engaging, enriching, and fun learning environment possible. The joy I get from providing them with such experiences is indescribable but comes at a cost. When my students enter the room each day, I can see how excited they are to be there and they cannot wait to find out what new things we will be doing that day.

Most of my students are on reduced or free lunch, and some even become the parent to smaller children when their school day ends. Through hard work and dedication, they made their way to my school and into my AICE psychology class where the level is that of a college course. If my students can pass a Cambridge exam at the end of the year, they receive free college credits. This is huge to most of my kids because chances of them affording college is low. Any way I can get them closer to a college degree, the better; not just for their own success, but for society as a whole. These are our future leaders. These children are of high intelligence and have wonderful minds. I just need the tools necessary to get them to their fullest potential. Color and organization is going to be the deciding factor for most of my students in their ability to study and obtain details associated with their curriculum. Color is the key; the use of different colors stimulate different function in the brain which includes: improved focus, relaxation, creativity, happiness, critical thinking and memory. Students will be able to create visual spatial maps as well as colorful web maps along with any art/images that will help them remember material. In combining these colorful effects with the use of note cards, we are able to have endless possibilities. The note cards will enable students to create games such as memory, taboo, jeopardy and even charades. The possibilities are endless! These games will encourage memory retention of the core studies associated with their final exam(s). Yes there are two exams they must pass in order to obtain their college credits. Finally, for those students who think in linear format the binder sleeves will become another way in which they will be able to organize the in depth details of the 10 core studies.

My students are treated as little humans who can make their own decisions when it comes to learning, including decisions about the physical environment in which they learn best. They use the restroom, get a drink, switch their seating etc. when it best meets their needs, not mine. I have high expectations and set individualized goals for each student.

Most of the students are bilingual and don’t start speaking English until they begin Kindergarten. At home they do not have access to many books or technology needed to strive in the twenty first century. Their only exposure to these things is when they are at school or what they bring from school to use at home. Despite all of their hardships and struggles they come to school everyday happy and ready to learn!At the school that I teach at the enrollment hovers around 700 students. Many of the students love to read but aren’t challenged enough. This year a group of teachers decided to change this and brought Battle of the Books to our school. It was a huge success. If you don’t know what that is I’ll explain it for you. Battle of the Books is when the students read books from a list. The books on the list are of various difficulty but picked to challenge students. Teams are formed and they compete in a day of competition answering questions about the books they read. Eventually, it comes down to two teams and a final battle. After the final battle a winner is crowned! It is a fun and exciting event that we hope to continue for years to come. In order for us to continue the competition we need multiple copies of high interest but challenging books for our next competition. One of the awesome things about Battle of the Books is that students can read the books individually or teachers can read them with their class. The book and audiobook (so students can listen to the book and follow along) that I am requesting is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The students at my school love the Harry Potter series but many have not read the books but have seen the movies. We all know the movie version of a book is often very different from the book itself. There are only a few loved copies of the book in our library.

Children come and go throughout the day and throughout the year. Meeting every child's individual academic and social needs is a fun challenge. My day is never boring! My students are a wonderful group of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders attending a high-poverty, urban elementary school. They have a wide range of disabilities that make it challenging for them to learn exclusively in a general education setting. They come to my room for small group instruction in reading, writing, math, and/or social skills. Most of my students are also English language learners. My students rely on consistent routines and access to models and visual examples of the tasks they are completing. They depend on engaging learning experiences that meet them at their individual instructional levels and tap into their personal interests. Most importantly, they depend on having access to the resources that support their individual instructional needs. My biggest challenge as a special education teacher is providing my students with an ever-changing supply of reading materials at their individual reading levels and interests. My school's community is very supportive of all of our learners, but our budget is very tight. While we are fortunate to have a great leveled library, it doesn't have enough breadth for my learners, who take longer to progress from one reading level to another. Likewise, the titles that span the 2nd and 3rd grade reading levels are unlikely to appeal to my older students.

To continue the fun at home, I print games monthly to send home for them to play with family. I believe these games are more appropriate than homework and contribute to quality family time. Many of my students ask to take home supplies from our classroom to complete their homework and games that I have sent home, such as crayons and dice. I would like to create a 'Kindergarten Success Packet' to share with parents at our beginning of the year Parent Night. This packet will include an alphabet picture book for students to begin building a home library, as well as sight word flash cards, printed alphabet, and math games, and the basic supplies they need to play each game. The dry erase sleeves, expo markers, dice, and game counters will allow students to play their favorite games repeatedly. Each month I would like to create a video for parents with information about what we are learning at school and introduce a new set of games, and a new picture book to add to their growing collection. With this project, I envision families gathered around the table, playing math racing games and CVC reading games; students and parents are building a bedtime routine that includes important family bonding time and a bedtime story. It is my dream these games and books give my children a head start at school success, and show them reading and math are not just for the classroom, but also for home and for life.","My students need alphabet books, crayons, glue, dice, math manipulatives, and storage materials to create a success packet to practice their skills at home.","Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Supplies,515.34,Fully Funded

While one kid may learn with a hands-on approach, another may just need to hear it. Many of my children have dyslexia where they switch numbers or letters backwards. But I also teach children who have ADHD, Autism, development delays or other health impairments. So to reach each and every one of their special personalities, I use centers in my classroom. We also use many positive reinforcers at school - for instance, a point system where they can buy things like teachers chair, small snacks or raffle tickets. They also get rewarded monthly if they reach their behavior goals.

Being a kid with special needs I need to incorporate different kinds of learning opportunities for my students. The emotion stones will be used in our morning meetings where they will identify what emotion they are feeling, why, and different startgies to cope. By talking about their emotions and why they feel this way, my other students learn empathy, how to help friends, tolerance, and honesty. I also asked for a CD program to teach my student students about diffferent experiences they will find out in the community. They will learn how to approach new experiences with tolerance. My Worry Monster will be available to eat any worrier or complaints they have. This is a coping skill to learn to write thing a down and store them in a separate area other than in themselves.

Our need to focus and learn in an environment that invites flexibility is key in my first grade classroom. Flexible seating offers students an opportunity to sit in a place that works best for them to learn. This way students use choice to stay engaged in their learning. This seating choice provides a comfortable alternative to traditional classroom chairs. I have students who rock and sometimes fall out of their traditional classroom chairs (which are mismatched and damaged). My classroom seating is in desperate need of a 21st Century makeover. Our seating needs to match our collaborative student-centered curriculum. Wobble chairs help improve posture and allow wiggly first grade students a chance to move and learn. The Gaiam Kids Balance Ball Chairs also offer the students an opportunity to choose seating that is comfortable for them. These chairs also improve posture, and the frame that holds the balance balls in place are a more stable option for first grade students.

They love learning new concepts in science, and they love talking about the world around them. Especially when it comes to issues that hit home with them, from race politics to school lunches. Our school is in a poor urban neighborhood, so students don't have a lot of reading material at home, and internet access is spotty, usually on a tiny cellphone. Most of them don't have the opportunity to take many vacations beyond the borders of our state, so we have to rely on books, magazines and the internet to broaden their understanding of the world. My students spend hours on the internet without necessarily thinking critically about what they read, see, and hear. They have many misconceptions about science and current events, and we are able to use Scholastic News magazine to tackle some of these misconceptions, as well as hone reading comprehension skills. We are requesting a class subscription to Scholastic News. Scholastic News does an excellent job of factual journalism for kids. Having this print resource is invaluable in our fifth grade classroom to keep up with what's really going on in the world. The teacher lesson plans and reading comprehension questions that come along with the magazine provide a standards-aligned starting point. The students love the digital edition and news extras that come with the subscription. The computer will even read the issue aloud, which is essential for my students who cannot read it for themselves.",My students need engaging print reading materials to make meaningful connections to literacy.,Literacy & Language,Grades 3-5,Books,807.24,Fully Funded

Let's work together to bring these sweet students some joy in their education by creating a safe place for them to be innovative, creative, and think outside of the box!I am requesting several different choices of seating arrangements for the students in my Writing and Social Studies classroom in order to meet their physical needs. I would love to do away with standard school chairs and replace them with ways for my students to get their bodies and minds moving such as bouncy bands and stools. Every child in my classroom has different physical needs, and I desire to create an environment of acceptance and tolerance through flexible seating. Whether it's a case of the wiggles or an itch to move, my students would greatly benefit from stools, a computer chair, a bench, and bouncy bands. For the past five years of my teaching career, I have seen kids 'eye' other students who have to stand during class or need to go on a quick walk to move around. I have heard comments made under their breaths about the differences in how students work. This was made possible by having conventional desks and chairs where any slight difference for one or two students is very noticeable. This cannot continue. I have to change my classroom environment. I would love to help students understand that everyone has different physical needs, and that is totally okay! Over the past few months I have been collecting exercise balls, standing desks, and bicycle peddlers in an attempt to create an accepting environment.

The reason DCS is so small is because we are, in essence, a modern-day, one-room schoolhouse. Our students are taught every subject in mixed-grade classes. We find, with the right amount of differentiating the material for the older and younger students, the students mentor one another, find role models, observe what struggle and humility look like. Our students are on a constant search to nurture and satisfy their sense of intellectual curiosity. To them and their families, education is the first priority in life. Because of the economic hardships many of our families face, they understand the connection between receiving a high-quality education and achieving success in life. We consider our school's curriculum to be extremely rigorous, and our expectations of our students are high. Our school represents the rich ethnic and racial spectrum of the city of Newark. Our students and staff are African-American, Caribbean, Caucasian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern: Muslim, Protestant, Jewish and Catholic. There are students whose families have been in Newark for decades, and students whose families have just arrived here from abroad: all-in-all our school community represents over 30 countries from around the world.DCS kicks off the coming school year with a school-wide, interdisciplinary unit of study on our city: Newark, NJ. The title of the unit is 'Newark: Revolution, Rebellion and Rebirth'. One of the periods we will focus on in-depth is the Newark Riots of 1967, also known as the Newark Rebellion. I am seeking literature to teach in English Language Arts which will enrich the students' knowledge of that period in American history, specifically as it relates to the African-American's struggle for civil rights in the 1960s. The 'March' Trilogy is a perfect vehicle to teach my students one man's real-life account of social rebellion in the 1960s, written in a format to which they can relate easily. 'March' is a graphic novel, presented in three parts, the story of the life of Rep. John Lewis. The format of a graphic novel will gain critical buy-in from my students and give them an immediate feeling that the material is in an accessible format. The use of 'comic book' conventions, will naturally convey the urgency and drama of the events. I am positive that the combination of the powerful content of John Lewis' story and the inviting design of the graphic novel will give my students a vivid context through which to view what happened in Newark in July of 1967: how it could happen in America and why it had to happen.","My students need to study the 'March' trilogy, so they may analyze the trajectory of a life steeped in the social activism and racial turmoil of 1960s America.","History & Civics, Literacy & Language",Grades 6-8,Books,1017.21,Fully Funded

We are a caring community of learners who watch out for each other, encourage each other, and show compassion for each other. We are excited to learn about our world and love acquiring new knowledge about how we are connected with our environment. We have a growth mindset in class, which means we might not be able to do something yet, but that doesn't mean we will never be able to do it or learn it. We work like scholars by sticking to the task and having a thirst for knowledge. We spend a lot of time developing number sense in first grade. Having a class set of sturdy Rekenraks will help my math lessons run more smoothly. In the past, I had the students make their own Rekenraks using cardboard, pipe cleaners, and red and white pony beads. However, they don't hold up very well because we use them a lot. I would have to stop the lesson to help a child put their handmade Rekenrak back together. It took precious time away from the lesson. Rekenraks will help my students develop the number sense they need to become fluent mathematicians.

311969880beb909a1bfc9b722ddbf84a,'Block Heads',"I teach in an arts magnet school that has a diverse population of students including low, middle and upper middle class families. Because I teach Transitional Kindergarten, my students come to me from all over our school district and are given a chance to experience Core Curriculum through instruction in visual and performing arts, culinary arts, music, drama, movement, and dance. Their creative, original work is shared all over campus, and each trimester at 'Presentation Nights.' One of the most beautiful elements on our campus is the incorporation of special needs students into our arts programs. Even though my students start school as four-year-olds, they quickly become responsible caring students and are encouraged to be collaborative learners. I am proud of the way my students embrace their classmates with special needs and treat them with respect and dignity. My project, 'Block Heads' is fueled by my belief that, when given interesting resources, students are inspired to problem solve. The simplicity of building blocks provokes the imagination of children. In order to build what they imagine, students have to figure things out, work together, and fail until they succeed. I have watched my students use the few blocks we have to create skyscrapers, airports, race tracks, homes, castles, parking garages, ramps, towers, train stations, and even a zoo! Block building has been a powerful motivator for my bilingual students to learn to communicate with their peers, and it has allowed my special needs students to play successfully alongside their classmates. The most significant work the children do as they play, is learn to share ideas, and collaborate to complete their vision. Even students with limited vocabulary can communicate ideas, and participate in block play. My current wooden block collection is small, so only a small group of children can play with them. I would love to see many small groups using blocks to build toward a common goal. For example, if one group is building an airport, another group might build a parking garage or restaurant that would support the airport. Blocks can compliment any curriculum theme. I believe that vocabulary is a predictor of academic success. If a child can imagine it, build it, and talk about it, later that same child will be able to write about it, and share reasons for his or her own ideas and experiences. I love the statement, 'good writing is good thinking.' It is my belief, that by creating a classroom full of 'Block Heads', my students will think better, and in time, they will be able to write better, calculate better, reason better, and create better.

Most of them are English Language Learners and their families come from countries around the world, living the American Dream. The rest of the students are native English speakers learning Spanish, becoming empowered and compassionate citizens by living and learning in another language, culture, and perspective. Many of my students struggle with issues of poverty and access to academic experiences. Fortunately, bilingual education is one of the best ways to close the achievement gap and to break down barriers of racism and socioeconomics! Actually, if a student is allowed to learn in their native language, they acquire English at a better and faster rate than those who do not. And they also have bilingual skills to share with the world and to learn about other cultures and perspectives! Unfortunately, I do not have sufficient materials in Spanish to help support their learning...this is why I need your help! Any donations will directly affect over 50 students as I teach 2 classrooms of students a day (they rotate with an English teacher). I will also use them for years and years to come! Help get 2nd graders interested in how a community works and how they can become productive members in our local and global community! We will also be learning Spanish as we read these wonderful and engaging books about communities near and far. At the same time I will also use our classroom as an example of a mini community as they use the clipboards and folders to work as a team to investigate and make changes in our own community. They will use the take home book bags to borrow these books to take home to share with their families, who are mostly Spanish speakers. The notebooks they will use to take notes and make maps about what they observe in their community and what needs to be improved. They will feel very important with their fancy folders, clipboards, and book bags, thus more likely they will use them and realize that they too have interesting ideas and input to share. We will write letters to community members and learn about our own community and different communities in our state. Finally, we will compare those to different communities around the world and write letters to students in those communities. We can connect with the world and realize our power to change it!

Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students speak English fluently, and some do not. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives.I teach math daily and the students will use these materials both in morning tubs to start their day using their math brains, and in small groups to review concepts that they've learned in class. These games and materials such as Magna-Tiles, dominoes, and flash cards will be very interesting to the children, and will help them gain valuable math skills. My students come with a variety of math skills, and these materials will allow me to differentiate work stations, and give me more time with students who need help in small groups. As a teacher, it is my job to make sure my students are learning everything they need to know. It is also my job as a teacher to make learning fun and meaningful. These games and materials will allow the children to have fun while reviewing taught skills, thus building their number sense and their math knowledge.","My students need math games and math materials such as Magna-Tiles, dominoes, and flash cards to use daily to enrich their math brains and experiences with numbers to build their computation skills.","Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades PreK-2,Supplies,577.51,Fully Funded

Fortunately, my students are those young people! They are some of the most creative, enthusiastic, and awesome people in the world! 'Ohh, I get it now!' is one of my favorite phrases to hear from my students. The pride in their faces and the boost in interest when the lightbulb comes on is a moment my students and I both look forward to. Serving students who chiefly reside in poverty-ridden neighborhoods, where formal education is not always held in high regard, has the potential to create an obstacle. That obstacle, however, is commonly overcome with earnest compassion and support. Innovatively inspiring our students to learn is the daily mission at my school. As a teacher in the Ninth Grade Academy, many of my students are constantly being introduced to new ways of learning. Every teaching technique is purposed to not only teach common high school subject matter but is also designed to teach acceptable social and work ethic skills. Personalized and self-paced learning has become one of the new leading instructional methods at my school. Having individual headphones for each student will help promote this style of learning. Between the 'Wait, I didn't get that' and 'Hurry up so we can move on' from one student to another, teaching classes larger than 25 students using the traditional method of whole class direct instruction becomes very cumbersome. I want my classroom to be a space where each student can be comfortable learning at their own pace without feeling rushed or slowed by other students. Having a class set of headphones allows me to offer each student the tools they need to actively participate in the learning environment I am aiming to create. When I can offer each student a pair of headphones, I am also offering them a sense of control by allowing them to stop, pause, and rewind any part of the lesson for any reason. Creating Educreations video lessons personalizes the lesson and gives students control on how quickly or slowly they obtain the information I am presenting. Educreations videos eliminate students idly waiting around or completing 'busy work' while others are finishing assignments they have already completed. Video lessons eliminate those issues by allowing students to move through the course content at their own pace.

All of my students receive occupational therapy support to help with fine motor abilities and sensory needs. We also work often on learning how to calm down and relax when a student gets upset or overwhelmed by something at school. Many things that we work on throughout the day are things that others take for granted. The ability to express one's emotions and self-regulate are difficult skills to teach and often require additional materials that are not always available in a typical classroom. My students need more materials to help with their fine motor skills. Fine motor tasks, such as writing, can quickly get boring and exhausting. Having more creative ways to strengthen these skills will help students be excited to work on these tasks and make writing easier in the future. Magnetic shapes and letter beads can help with math concepts and spelling skills while strengthening the muscles needed for fine motor tasks such as writing and cutting. Scooper tongs and suction cups require a lot of strength to make them work and are less frustrating to practice with because they are fun! I am working hard to create a space that is calming and relaxing for students when they need a sensory break or materials to help self-regulate their emotions. Have a soft place to sit and calming items are the best way to teach students how to calm themselves down when they are overwhelmed or upset. A beanbag is a perfect place to plop in to when you're upset or overwhelmed-we do not have any other soft spots to sit!

As the world progresses, my desire is to teach my students 21st Century skills so that they can thrive and be successful throughout their academic career. In the past, studies have shown an enormous lack of students graduating from college and entering into careers such as science, technology, engineering, art and music. However, in present time, STEAM jobs are in high demand. While these jobs are in high demand, the challenge is finding qualified candidates to fill the positions.I believe if I introduce the numerous facets of STEAM, students will be more knowledgeable about its details, what they entail, and prompt their curiosity. My students will use the Legos to invent structures that we have read about in various fiction and non-fiction books. Students will be given differentiated tasks to invent or create structures based on their own imagination. The STEM gadgets that I am requesting will be used for the same tasks as well. Finally, the beatbox will be used to teach about engineering and how it is used not only to govern electricity but also in the music and instruments that are heard on a daily basis. Students will be able to explore a small portion of music production using the beatbox.

Our students come from predominantly single parent homes where survival, and not literacy, is paramount. We have a dedicated, highly professional faculty, yet 'extra' materials that enhance curriculum are not a priority. Most teachers write grants and/or spend their own funds in order to facilitate the basic needs of our children. Our children need to be exposed to authors who deal with issues such as: violence, prejudice, intolerance, and human differences. Current literacy research states, '...using authentic texts and giving children choices are powerful and necessary conditions in the development of thinking, learning, and autonomy.' We have super, awesome students at our school who deserve only the BEST!The New York Times #1 Bestseller, WONDER, by R.J.Palacio swept through middle schools lighting a fire of enlightenment. Kids everywhere became aware and tolerant of those with kids with unusual disabilities. WONDER provided an authentic hero who dealt with abuse and intolerance with phenomenal courage. But how did the other children deal with Augie's facial disfigurement? What is their perspective? How did Augie's teacher support him? The additional stories, AUGIE AND ME, THREE WONDER STORIES, will enhance WONDER, help children make connections across texts, and highlight acceptance of differences as opposed to bullying and ostracism. The stories enable children to connect literacy and personal experiences in a realistic manner that will support positive change in our lives. I want them to become proud of who they are, and the contributions that they will eventually make to improve their communities. After completing each novel, the students will create an art project that displays their understandings and interpretations of the novel.

These six and seven year olds are learning to read, have become writers and have made big gains in math. We are busy all day long, and there's still much to do. My students are in first grade, and love coming to school to learn!They come from a wide variety of living situations. Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students speak English fluently, and some do not. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives.STEM learning conveys how science, technology, engineering and mathematics work together in the real world. Science is everywhere in the world around us, while technology is continuously expanding into most areas of our lives. Engineering is the basic design of roads, dams & bridges, but also tackles the challenges of reaching farther into space and using solar energy. Mathematics is essential for most occupations. By exposing students to STEM learning and giving them opportunities to explore STEM-related concepts, they will hopefully develop a passion for it while they are young that will carry into their adult lives. STEM education creates critical thinkers, increases science literacy, and enables the next generation of innovators.STEM activities provide hands-on and minds-on lessons for the student. Making math and science both fun and interesting helps the student to do much more than just learn, and allows creativity and problem solving. This teacher's guide, and picture books will help teach 15 kid-friendly lessons that convey how science, technology, engineering, and mathematics intersect in the real world. Reading comprehension strategies are embedded into the STEM subjects and English language arts through high-quality picture books.

They're just excited to try something new. We are an urban school in Minnesota with bright, creative students. Our band program has been expanding so quickly that I do not have enough instruments for my students. Since starting at my school in 2012, the number of students in band has grown from 38 to over 200! This is a great problem to have, but even after years of generous donations by countless individuals, finding affordable used instruments, and borrowing/trading with other schools, we still don't have enough instruments for every student who wants to be in band. These trumpets would mean three students who can't otherwise afford an instrument will be able to participate in band. These instruments will not only give the students that play them an enriching opportunity to learn the trumpet, it will give them a chance to identify as musicians. Playing one of these trumpets could give a student who might struggle in other academic areas a chance to shine. Making music is special. Studies have shown a link between reading and math scores and making music.

We are trying to provide technology and critical thinking skills for our students. Many of our students have never left Monroe County except on field trips with the school. I would like the opportunity to take them to colleges, and businesses that depend on technology. This would give them an opportunity to expand their thinking and possible open up career choices for our students. Ty, Leary, Colette, Delana, Laura and Allison were given an idea on using 3D printers to help teachers in the classroom. They have attended conference and witnessed what other schools are doing with technology. They decided to work on getting a 3D printer for the EAST classroom. Students working in EAST Initiative classrooms gain a sense of community and working in groups. When students work with computers and printers they learn a skill that can lead to a career. As a low income community, we don't have the money to buy technology that is new and innovative. We want to be able to print articles to use in the classroom and will help make students understand concepts easier. Teachers can work with students to create items that can be used in the classroom to teach, this will help build repoire. Students will provide visual aides for teachers. Students will work in groups and learn to work as a team. The students will then go out and explain what they are doing and how a 3D printer can help teachers. We will be leaders in the school when we work on computer skills and share our ideas to learn. We really think this project is important to progress our school in technology and the ever changing world.

However, my 8th grade students are extraordinary young adults with strong leadership skills and a great deal of resilience. They work hard and want to do their best, therefore we see incredible amounts of growth during a school year because they use their challenges to push themselves academically. One of my favorite quotes is from William Wordsworth: 'Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he could be and he will become what he should be.' My students know I live by this quote and view them all as incredible humans beings with great potential. I believe in their success, and I always hold them to high expectations! Universal themes and lessons learned through great literature can bring us all together. My students are encouraged to acknowledge different perspectives and gain an understanding of the struggles people face all over the world.

My students are an enthusiastic group of second and third graders who are excited about learning. Many of my students, however, face significant learning challenges. I have students who face the challenge of dyslexia, ADHD, autism, visual tracking issues, and other learning disabilities. These special needs can impact their ability to access the skills and concepts I am teaching. Watching my students succeed and become confident learners inspires me to find more ways to support them.

It's a fun way to develop reading fluency and expression, especially for struggling readers. One of my students' favorite parts of Reader's Theater is making simple props and costumes for their performances.

My students come from a wide range of different cultures, backgrounds, and even different languages. Regardless of what language they speak at home, music is a language in which everyone can communicate and share. 'Music is the universal language of mankind.' Henry Wadsworth Longfellow could not have put it more accurately. Music allows me to communicate with all students. It does not matter what language they speak, what culture they are from, if they have a disability, etc. Music speaks to all, and through music, I can speak to all. The Orff-Schulwerk approach (or Orff approach) is a philosophy of teaching music. It is designed around what kids do best: play. In an Orff classroom, children move, sing, dramatize, play instruments, and more. This developmental approach to teaching music encourages students to explore, collaborate, and express themselves through music. The Orff approach helps students find the joy in performing, without feeling judged by their classmates or their teacher. Everyone is treated as equals, even in regards to solos. This encourages the students to enjoy making music alone and in groups. In order for me to become a certified Orff teacher, I have to take a two week long course during the summer. There are three levels of certification, and I will be doing my first level.

They are an amazing group of young people facing a variety of challenges, including food insecurity, witnessing police and interpersonal violence, increased anti-immigrant sentiment, and racial or gender discrimination--in addition to the more mundane difficulties that come with being on the verge of adolescence. (Maybe you remember--puberty is tough!) I work at a Title I school in Oakland that serves 750 students in grades K-5, and over two thirds of the students in my class speak one of 15+ non-English home languages represented at my school. My students are creative, clever, and kind, and they deserve everything I can give them! While breakfast is available free of charge to every student at my school, many are unwilling or unable to take advantage. Dietary needs, picky eating, arriving late due to bus and traffic mishaps... It just isn't possible for all of them to get school breakfast. Additionally, school starts at 8:40 and lunch isn't until 12:20, which is a long time to go without eating when you're ten! The P.E. coaches sell healthy snacks like the ones I've requested during morning recess, but not every family has the funds to send their kids to school with a little pocket money. Learning should be challenging, but it should also be rewarding and achievable, and it's tough to focus on equivalent fractions or complex nonfiction when your stomach is growling. Sometimes all a kid needs is a granola bar in order to get back into the game. It's much easier to focus on your teacher's instructions or your group members' ideas when you're well-nourished. I've often purchased boxes of healthy snacks to distribute, but I simply can't afford to furnish one for every hungry kid, each and every day.

'If you aim for the moon and miss at least you will still land among the stars'My Kindle's for Kinder's project will bring my classroom into the modern age. Student's in my Title 1 school come from low income households and often miss out on the benefits of educational technology such as tablets and laptops. Having these tablets in our classroom will allow for endless opportunities across the content areas. These tablets will be used for alphabet and phonemic awareness practice, math application games, listening centers and the list goes on. These tablets will provide an opportunity to interact with technology that most of these children would not get to experience otherwise. I hope to provide as many real world experiences to my students as possible. The luxury of classroom tablets would have an amazing impact on our class. Another tool I am eager to implement in my classroom is Math Tool Boxes. In my math block I encourage my students to solve problems in multiple ways. Each individual child has a unique thinking and problem solving process. The math tool boxes I plan to build will contain a variety of manipulatives such as counters, tens frames, snap cubes, number lines, number bond mats and much more. The pencil boxes will be use to house all of these materials and allow the students to have the freedom to chose the math manipulatives that will work for them to solve various problems. This will foster their mathematical thinking and allow them to explore math concepts instead of learning a one size fits all process to solving problems. Once fully funded this project will allow my students above all the freedom to explore in their learning and allow their confidence to grow as they learn.

This has a huge impact on how they learn in class. These issues also affect how students react to others. Many students continue to struggle and have no basic skills on how to cope with their problems. I am an educator at Tulsa Public Schools. I have been teaching for 12 years. My life is my job. I strive to be the best I can be and model this behavior for my students. This past summer I was excited to receive a grant from Donors Choose for yoga mats for an after-school yoga club.I have been working hard on my health and have really felt the advantages of taking yoga. I want to share this with students. So many studies have been done on behavior and how meditation in yoga benefits students. Teaching in a high-poverty school, I see how stress affects students.

They are always ready and eager to fully engage themselves in daily music education. With your help, we can enhance their music education to help them achieve their personal musical goals and dreams!It is well known that music is extremely beneficial to childhood development. Learning to play an instrument, such as the ukulele, provides students with many benefits, which are applied inside and outside of the music classroom. When students learn to play the ukulele, fine motor and coordination skills are developed as students learn strumming and chord patterns. Students develop and build their listening skills as they tune their own instruments and learn to play a variety of songs. When playing in an ensemble, students work collaboratively and collectively, improving their social and emotional skills on a daily basis. In the music classroom, students will compose their own songs, which provides students multiple opportunities for creativity and risk-taking. In my years teaching music, I have seen how music education, in which students sing and play instruments, provides an outlet for creativity and individuality.

Our neighborhood is known to be one of the most diverse in the country and every classroom in our school reflects that gift. In addition to the richness that such diversity brings, we also recognize that different opportunities and experiences in early childhood can create inequitable beginnings for children in school. As a school community, we know without a doubt that all of our students are highly capable and work with determination to ensure that every student has the resources, instruction, and support necessary to achieve success. First grade is a time of tremendous growth for students. They launch from the building blocks of kindergarten to delve further into more complex thinking. In reading, they move from working with the alphabet and decoding words to making meaning of texts by making connections, comparing and contrasting characters, making inferences, and more. In math, they move from working on counting and using models like fingers and drawings to add and subtract to using a variety of strategies to mentally solve problems with greater and greater quantities. This rigorous work demands fluency both in reading words and in math facts. Our first grade classes use various computer programs to help our students develop this fluency. Of the 12 computers that are shared among our 3 first grade classrooms, half don't have usable headphones. Many of the headphones are low-quality- with only one side still emitting sound. Others are missing the foam cushioning or are even taped together. The remaining are adult-sized, so go past the ears of our first graders and frequently slip off of their heads.

Now, don’t forget that you also have ADHD, or depression, or a learning disability. You’re being expected to retain all of this abstract information, while your body and mind are running on fumes. Supplying my students with the food they need in the morning allows them to start their day on the right foot! Breakfast gives your body and mind the fuel it needs to run well all day. For most of my students, school is already difficult. Add an empty stomach to that, and they can sometimes feel it is impossible. While it seems simple, breakfast is a big deal for my students.

The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” In their short time in 5K, they have learned that books allow them to to discover things they never knew and to experience amazing adventures. I am teaching my students to learn to read so that they can read to learn in the future. My goal is to have children fall in love with reading! Debra KostrewaRaymond School 5K TeacherHaving my students read their little reader books to their families every week is the cornerstone of our school’s homework program.

Our school is our safe haven and within these four walls, we are family. As a school counselor, my goal is to create a counseling suite where my kids feel safe to come in and talk about life. In order to do this, I have to create a calm and welcoming environment where students feel comfortable to open up and talk about the things they are struggling with. The items I have chosen to be funded will help me create a counseling space that is warm, inviting, and safe for kids as I do one-on-one and group counseling with them. The space will set the tone for our sessions and will give students a sense of belonging.

Our school caters to working parents with extended school hours, free breakfast, and provides extended learning after school hours. Our incredibly dedicated professional staff works hard to provide hope and especially joy and appreciation for learning which enables young scholars desperate to escape from crushing and oppressive poverty. I am confident that providing actual hands-on lab experiences will encourage and motivate even the more reluctant learners. We are requesting a biochemistry kit, chemistry of esters kit, enzymes and cheese making kit and lead test kit. Being able to engage in scientific inquiry will positively impact my scholars' lives. My students have never had opportunities to experience actual chemistry, and we spent the entire first semester getting caught up on material they should have seen in middle school. However, a quality science program is expensive. I have spent hundreds of dollars of my own money to try and give these deserving youth exposure to this amazing content. Anything my students get to do in the lab will motivate them to achieve excellence and change their lives.

I work on giving them successes in the classroom to help them reach their potential. So many times in the past few years I have noticed that students have so much trouble focusing on learning. They need many movement breaks and sometimes even that is not enough. There has been a push to offer flexible seating arrangements in classrooms. From everything I have seen and read, this has made a huge positive impact on attention and student learning. I would love a chance to offer this opportunity to my students using wobble chairs.

Our school parents, like all parents, want what's best for the education of their children. They give as much as they can to fund supplies and consumables that go to the classrooms. However, the financial problems of the school have negatively impacted every classroom. Our student-teacher ratio is extremely high and students are often crammed into classrooms that are too small to allow them much room to comfortably work. I actively look for ways to facilitate teaching and learning, allowing my students to move and collaborate while learning in a rich and welcoming environment. I have flexible seating options and desks that can be easily arranged for a variety of tasks. I want the students in my class to be excited to enter the room each and every day.

As a part of my music classroom, we spend a lot of time working on music literacy through the Orff Schulwerk Method using barred instruments like xylophones. I love seeing students eyes light up when they finally are able to read music and play music on their own! Music is such a part of all of our lives and I love that I get to help students experience it through these lively and fun lessons. I don't have kids of my own so my students are my babies! They come to school every day and are so enthusiastic about learning new music and playing fun songs. I am grateful I get to spend my days doing life with these kiddos. Work is not work when you love what you do!“Since the beginning of time, children have not liked to study. They would much rather play, and if you have their interests at heart, you will let them learn while they play; they will find that what they have mastered is child’s play.” – Carl Orff The Orff approach teaches children through experiences in music, speech, and movement. Feelings precede theoretical knowledge. Students develop understandings from discovery. Their early music education often begins with experiencing rhythm through childhood chants and children’s’ rhymes. Children go on to explore music and movement in ways similar to “real life” musicians and dancers. Learning is structured so success is immediate. For example, children might play a steady beat drone on barred instruments to accompany a pentatonic song. These first harmonies echo the traditional instrument drones that historically have accompanied folk songs and tunes from nearly all cultures around the world. While very simple or elemental, these accompaniments are effective. As children accompany a song, improvise a melody, create a dance or work with musical forms, they are engaged in real-life tasks. Through joyful music making, movement and words children learn through child’s play. This professional development will increase my knowledge in this teaching method. It will allow me the skills to implement it in my Magnet Creative Arts School. I believe the students will benefit just as the founder stated, learning through singing, saying, dancing, and playing. The funding you provide will cover the cost of my course fee, food, transportation, and materials for this 10 day course.","I need funding for my coursework in the Orff Schulwerk Level 1 class.

Some come from two parent homes, some from single parents, and some with multiple generations, or multiple families living in one apartment. Some of my students speak English fluently, and some do not. Some of my students come from families who support public education and encourage their students to do their best while at school. While at school, I hold high expectations for each student in their behavior and their academics, no matter their home life. We learn together, we work through problems together, and we celebrate successes together. Helping my students learn the skills of reading and math will help them for their entire lives. My students have read about butterflies this year, and have seen videos about the butterfly life cycle. Now that they have the basic understanding of this life cycle, I want to give them a hands-on experience, learning about these real insects from their own observations. Watching and recording what these real insects are doing will cement the knowledge that my students have learned this year about butterflies. They will have the opportunity to actually see the caterpillars move and eat, build their chrysalis, and hatch as butterflies. These butterflies would start as caterpillars in the Insect Lore Live Caterpillar kit. Without this project, my students would not have this opportunity to carefully observe these live insects. Within this project that will take several weeks to complete, I have created a STEM lesson where my students will be presented with the problem of creating a balloon butterfly that will really fly using baking soda, vinegar and a 2 liter bottle. They will also design a butterfly habitat with a plastic butterfly counter, and a butterfly craft project that will recycle used crayons. The Elmer's 1680 crayon sharpener will be used to make crayon shavings for the craft butterfly activity. The books in this project including, Ultimate Bugopedia, My-Oh My-A Butterfly, National Geographic Caterpillar to Butterfly, as well as other books, will offer real information about caterpillars and other insects, that the students can record in their science journals as they make connections. The Hungry Caterpillar book and the Life Cycle sequencing kit will be used as an attention grabber and wrap up to the project.

The other half of my students come from broken homes and currently live with one parent who tries their best to juggle life’s responsibilities. My students are overcomers and they WANT to learn. Currently, everyone in our county has free lunch and breakfast due to the overwhelming poverty rates and we receive government-funded snacks as well.

When I work, I want to be comfortable and sometimes it is not at a desk. The same goes for the students that are in my classroom. This Flex-Space floor collaboration bundle will provide the students with a different option than a normal desk. Many students also have attention problems, being able to move and change seating can eliminate the behavior issues that may arise. The Flex-Space bundle will allow students to get on the floor comfortably together as they are collaborating in all subject areas. Students spend MOST of their school day in the classroom so their seating options need to fit their sensory needs. That may be having a chair that allows them to move, a classroom that they can collaborate, and even a spot where they can work in peace.

This project is to teach my students about the importance of taking care of the Earth. In our classroom, we do all we can to help the environment including recycling and reusing. My students always look at things before they put them in the trash and ask if we really need to throw them away. They are the future and if they are empowered to take care of Earth, they will share their knowledge with others. There are three parts to this project that will enhance my student's learning of the importance of being responsible. They might be little, but they have great power. The first part is to help stock our Creation Station area in our classroom. In the Creation Station, students create projects out of materials that would have been thrown away. Currently, students sit in the floor, but wobble stools will allow them to have a place to sit as they reuse materials. We have a bits box where we place all leftover paper from any cutting projects we do in class as well as old magazines and newspapers.
