We perform concerts with our beginner and two advanced bands. We rehearse daily and strive for the highest! My students are passionate, hard workers. The band is made up of about 170 members. Even though 96.7 percent are economically disadvantaged, these students deserve a chance to experience the best education and musical experience they can get! We are an inner city school. Our band students will use these reeds literally everyday that they are performing. Without these reeds, the band would not be able to create music! Our clarinet, bass clarinet, and saxophone students will be using them from the beginner level through the last concert of their 8th grade year!The joy and education of learning a musical instrument should not be under-valued. It helps students express themselves, work as a team, multitask, and utilize their visual, tactile, aural skills. Through these donations, you will enable our band to be the best it can be. Students learn through their experiences. Band offers them a chance to accomplish something beautiful, as a team. They start from learning just one note, to playing entire concerts. This helps them feel good about themselves and everything they can accomplish.

Physical playing time is reduced, and student learning is limited. My students learn through singing, movement, speech, creating and performing on instruments. 'Tell me, I forget, show me, I remember, involve me, I understand' (Orff). I teach 600 students in grades K-5 and they come to me for 45 minutes once a week. My school is a Title I school in a military town. Military families many times will move away due to orders or deployments, but often return 1 to 3 years later. Students at my school are eager to learn and are most excited about performing on instruments and creating and performing their own compositions. I recently certified in the Orff process and want to use this approach as a way for my students to learn. Students will learn through exploration and creating. With these glockenspiels, students will be able to improvise melodies (create on the spot), compose melodies, and accompany other students who are singing, moving, speaking or performing on other instruments. The music used in the Orff process is based on folk songs to which students have connections. They will be able to connect with students who are not from America (we have students from Yemen, China, Mexico, Columbia etc), places families have been deployed (Japan, Germany, Africa etc), and, of course, American folk music! While 2 more instruments may seem insignificant, having 2 more Orff instruments (glockenspiels) will allow more students to participate in an activity. This will reduce time and the number of groups switching out on instruments. More instruments will impact students by allowing them more learning opportunities and more time to appreciate those opportunities.

900480197d3e193dcdf356ad20273920,Beautification Through Gardening,"'Whenever you are creating beauty around you, you are restoring your own soul.' Alice WalkerMy students come alive through the beautification of our school through gardening. As a veteran teacher at my high school, I wondered if beauty affected the learning process. This year I found out. I had an idea in my environmental science class. The students supported and jumped right in. Most come from broken homes and impoverished neighborhoods. Often times, school is the place where they can get away from their realities at home. Our school would be the perfect escape if they had something to look forward to. Our class is filled with seniors whom have yet to see their school at it's peak of success. There is a need for that success. As a teacher I wish for my students to bask in the beauty of awesomeness. I wish for them to start a legacy that will be passed on. I wish for them to return to their home and see how they have contributed to the success of their community. This starts with the beautification of our campus. Someone once planted some roses in our courtyards. The roses have not reached their full potential. Students will learn how to prune and care for our roses to make them thrive. We currently started a vegetable garden in a courtyard and used old planters in another area of our school to continue planting. We have been walking our water hose from one side of campus to another. A hose cart would be the perfect tool to make this process more efficient. Our water nozzle has broken and we are in need of another. We have been manipulating the water as it comes out of the hose by placing our thumb on the end of the spout. We are desperately in need of outdoor gardening soil and or manure. Our ground is not fertile. Students will learn the elements needed in soil to create a sustainable growing environment for plants and vegetables. They will also be able to participate in soil testing labs. Knowing that anonymous people are investing in their efforts will help change their attitudes toward people in life. The beautification of our school through gardening will allow the students to gain the hands on experience in agricultural studies. This will also be the catalyst of projects to come and future partnerships for our school as we move forward. ","My students need a garden hoe, water nozzle, portable hose cart, and a pruner set to aid in the beautification of our courtyards and maintenance of our campus gardens.","Math & Science, Special Needs",Grades 9-12,Supplies,444.32,Fully Funded

How exciting to be selected as an elite musician to compete, representing the school and community! It is important to look polished and coordinated as a music group. We have matching vests but the students cannot afford to all purchase the dress shirts. Please help us! The students are 6-8th graders in a high poverty, Title I school in urban San Antonio. The neighborhood has high crime and poverty, but also has families working hard to get their children educated. The school has struggled for years with making academic gains and with the high needs of the students. The music program has around 200 students and is a full day program. The musicians range from very beginning to advanced. I believe that music is essential in learning and strive to make our program competitive with other programs. I am so excited that our best musicians will be able to compete in multiple concerts and competitions! These children have so much talent, hope, and desire to be the best, and have dreams for their future to be contributing and supportive members of society. I believe they can! Imagine a musical group looking groomed and fervently desiring to provide music that creates joy and awe! The elite musicians from my classes have been selected and have been diligently practicing difficult music for the upcoming UIL competition. The skills they have mastered from learning to read music, to the discipline they have learned from consistent practice, are life-long skills that are needed in life and any career. Learning the persistence and patience to be successful is a critical skill. Performing together in a well versed team is another critical skill. Feeling respected, valued, and honored is an extra bonus that comes from being in a competing wind ensemble group and is only complete with a great uniform. The students have the desire, hope, talent, and matching vests to create a beginning for looking polished. Matching dress shirts for under the vests are the missing touch that will make a difference in their look and feelings of pride. There is no memory more empowering to a young student than one where you feel so much pride and happiness because you are part of a winning team. Winning teams have the common characteristics of hard work, persistence, support, and desire. Your support makes this team look the part of a polished group. It is important because it shows these students that there is a world filled with generous caring people, who want all children to achieve their dreams.

We also perform at games and other events for our school! My students are passionate, intelligent, and hard working. They are usually not given much in life, but what they do have, they appreciate and take care of. They often come from inner city San Antonio, from extreme poverty, homelessness, or traumatic home lives. My school is becoming an in-district computer science charter school to help further their opportunities. My students also get many chances to perform. Some of our performances occur at football games, pep rallies, and other events. My students will use the music lyres to hold their music while they perform. The woodwinds cannot hold their music and play at the same time because their instruments require two hands! The lyre clips the music close enough so the student can see it. This allows us to wow, inspire, and entertain the crowds with our music! My students will be able to use these at athletic games, pep rallies, elementary visits, surprise birthday performances for staff, and other events! Allowing the children more chances to share their craft will only inspire them to do more. My favorite quote is: “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel”. This quote applies to this project because of the impact the lyres will have in my classroom. They will allow the students to feel relevant, professional, and more engaged. When my students feel positive about my class and their learning experiences in it, they will work harder and come to school more frequently.

The biggest challenge for our band students is mastery- practicing something everyday takes patience, persistence, and good collaboration skills. Our students often do not come in with these skills. The more tools I have at my disposal to catch their attention, the better my rate of success with them. The document cameras will be an invaluable tool for our band classes. My students will use the document cameras in the classroom everyday. I will use it to show them their music for the day, how to mark their music, how to finger notes, and to show them chords or other instrument parts that relate to what they are playing. The document cameras will allow me to reach every student in my classroom immediately. It is an unlimited, engaging tool that will allow them to becoming mini-professional musicians. Donations to my project will be an amazing contribution that will change the dynamic of my classroom. Students are automatically more interested in technology.

We have students in khaki, black, khaki shorts, etc. They do not own black clothing and in many cases, they cannot afford to get them. The students have at least three competitions a year, and three separate concerts. These events put us in front of groups who have $100,000 funding every year, in front of judges from all over the nation, and in front of proud parents. When our students show up in the best of what clothing they have, it is often still not what the group needs to look professional.

Students travel from all over the county to attend school somewhere they feel understood and a sense of belonging. . The materials that I am requesting are therapeutic work books. They are designed to provide creative ways to present lessons help motivate students to strive through their struggles. I work with many of these students throughout their formative school years and want to continue to provide fresh innovative ways to assist them in becoming their best selves. Different messages reach different students so continuing to build my resource library allows me to the best chances to reach all the children that I work with. My lessons developed through these resource materials work to build students motivation, confidence, mood regulation, and healthy interactions. Children are taught to work through their frustrations with schoolwork and classmates. They learn to have courage and overcome the challenges presented by their disabilities. The workbooks help children to understand how their actions affect others and their relationships with them.

Although we have only been together for a couple weeks, I am amazed at their abilities. I cannot wait to see what great things they will accomplish this year. I strive to provide my students with the most engaging, enriching, and fun learning environment possible. The joy I get from providing them with such experiences is indescribable but comes at a cost. When my students enter the room each day, I can see how excited they are to be there and they cannot wait to find out what new things we will be doing that day. It is my goal to keep that look on their face for all 180 days of the school year. With your help I can make that possible!When it comes to reading my students can't get enough. They are constantly visiting our classroom library to see what new books they can read each week. We have been using cardboard book bins throughout the year, and as a result of being carried around the classroom countless times they are tattered and torn. Having new book bins will allow my students a safe and sturdy place to store their books in without having to worry whether or not their (cardboard) box will fall over and spill their books all over the floor. Having these book bins will not only help my students this year but it will help students in the years to come.

Most of my students are on reduced or free lunch, and some even become the parent to smaller children when their school day ends. Through hard work and dedication, they made their way to my school and into my AICE psychology class where the level is that of a college course. If my students can pass a Cambridge exam at the end of the year, they receive free college credits. This is huge to most of my kids because chances of them affording college is low. Any way I can get them closer to a college degree, the better; not just for their own success, but for society as a whole. These are our future leaders. These children are of high intelligence and have wonderful minds. I just need the tools necessary to get them to their fullest potential. Color and organization is going to be the deciding factor for most of my students in their ability to study and obtain details associated with their curriculum. Color is the key; the use of different colors stimulate different function in the brain which includes: improved focus, relaxation, creativity, happiness, critical thinking and memory. Students will be able to create visual spatial maps as well as colorful web maps along with any art/images that will help them remember material. In combining these colorful effects with the use of note cards, we are able to have endless possibilities. The note cards will enable students to create games such as memory, taboo, jeopardy and even charades. The possibilities are endless! These games will encourage memory retention of the core studies associated with their final exam(s). Yes there are two exams they must pass in order to obtain their college credits. Finally, for those students who think in linear format the binder sleeves will become another way in which they will be able to organize the in depth details of the 10 core studies. Since I teach 90 students and there are 20 studies, 10 sleeves each (front and back) should hold that material quite well.","My students need study materials for their upcoming AICE Cambridge exam: plastic binder sleeves, index cards and multi-colored pens.","Applied Learning, History & Civics",Grades 9-12,Supplies,156.34,Fully Funded

My students come from diverse ethnic and financial backgrounds, but they all come to learn. My classroom is designed around my students and is truly all about them. I tossed my desks out years ago and replaced them with tables; my classroom is an alternative seating experiment. My students are treated as little humans who can make their own decisions when it comes to learning, including decisions about the physical environment in which they learn best. They use the restroom, get a drink, switch their seating etc. when it best meets their needs, not mine. I have high expectations and set individualized goals for each student. While one student is working on mastering grade level curriculum, another is being challenged at their own level and working on 7th-grade educational experience. Please help me in my journey to do this by supporting our little 'scamily' (school family).My students are amazing little humans. In my classroom I have all levels of learners but they have one thing in common.... their amazing attitudes towards learning and their GIANT amounts of effort they are willing to put into their studies! Ninety percent of my class come outside of school hours each week voluntarily to improve their areas of greatest needs. For many of my students, this area is reading! The majority of my students truly struggle with independent reading and it's almost like pulling teeth to get them to pick up a book on their own! TOON Graphics are amazing, colorful, high-interest novels that even the most reluctant reader will love. Please help me add these amazing books to my classroom library! I know the appeal graphic novels have on even the most struggling learner. Their great illustrations convince kiddos to read every page. The use of visuals these novels use also ties into many higher level thinking skills and help to meet many state and national standards for fourth grade. My students are very into mythology this year. It is also a difficult genre to teach! These novels would allow them additional practice with so many fourth grade skills including interpreting graphics and how they relate to the text, determining theme, understanding allusions in myths, and understanding and using figurative language.

In first grade children discover what it is to truly understand a book, fall in love with a character, go on an adventure or learn about their favorite nonfiction topic. My students are exploring this new world with eagerness and enthusiasm and reading up a storm. Our classroom library needs more diverse books. The books that come in pre-created sets that are delivered to the school overwhelming feature white characters and white families. Some of our books are very old and out of touch with the times. All children should have an opportunity to see themselves represented in the books they read. Children get excited about characters that they feel they can identify with. The added benefit is that their reading levels improve when they are more excited about their books. All children need to see diversity in books to better understand our world.

Despite the many challenges and differences my students present, I look to give each one of them a high quality learning experience that will set the tone for their later years in school. My students are thinkers and creators. They like to move, they love to read and love lots of positive attention. Many of them are being raised in single parent households and receive a free breakfast and lunch based on their socioeconomic status.

I may not be able to control their home lives, however, I can certainly control their experience during the school day.

As an avid reader, I understand the importance of choices in titles and with these books; my students will open their minds and enjoy books.
