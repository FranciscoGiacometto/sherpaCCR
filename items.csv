b94e64a19c9d26503d5470ce8fe4fd19,Cooking in the Functional Skills Class,"Do you remember learning to cook your first meal? My students will be adults in the next few years, but have had few opportunities to learn appropriate cooking skills. I teach a class for students with moderate to severe disabilities. My students all attend a public school and spend some time in a special education setting and some time with their typical peers. They have a wide range of skill levels and abilities, but they are all on a functional life skills curriculum, meaning their goals in school are to learn basic skills required to navigate life. With the addition of cooking supplies, including a skillet, a griddle, a crock pot, and kitchen utensils, my students will have the opportunity to learn to make and/or assist in making simple meals. We will be able to make a wide array of foods traditionally cooked on a stovetop including pancakes, tacos, and spaghetti. They will also be given the opportunity to try new foods that they have not tasted in the past, broadening their food preferences through experience. By donating to this project, you are helping my students learn skills that will last them throughout their life. My students will be able to learn some basic cooking skills and try new, delicious foods that they've never tried before. Please consider donating to this project.

I encourage my students to find those books that stimulate and create a desire to read daily. Let's give them the resources that continue to draw my dragons in and keep the fire for reading alive! The imagination of my students and the information they share about the books they read, drive me to give them rich and equitable resources to engage them in reading. Their eyes light up with excitement when they are taught about specific authors, genres, readers theaters and are able to debate current issues and topics through reading. My students come from diverse backgrounds and most do not have a libraries at home. I often allow them to take books from our classroom library to ensure they are carrying the love of reading home. My adorable dragons continue to excel and grow through reading. This is only one way I can continue to help them thrive and grow. I cannot even begin to express what 'Storyworks' will allow me to integrate in the classroom, or the benefits it will bestow upon my students, but I will give it my best shot. As we have rolled out Common Core Standards, it has been challenging to find resources and text to support our lessons. As I stumbled upon a copy of 'Storyworks,' it has enhanced my teaching significantly. I am able to teach complex text in a wide range of genres, share thrilling narrative non-fiction text, original fiction, bring historical events to life through readers theater, explore classic and contemporary poetry, as well as support each one of my students at their individual levels. The best part of 'Storyworks' is I am able to allow my students to take them home and share them with their family and loved ones. This request is not only for my own personal classroom but that of my grade level. I desire to let my passion for reading to infiltrate as many as you will allow.

Working at a Title I school comes with several challenges. Over half of my third-graders are on free or reduced lunch. Two-thirds come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. It's no surprise that so many of them struggle with comprehension. By the time students enter my classroom, most of them have learned to read fluently, but have little comprehension. Reading without meaning is a recurring problem year after year. With this project, I hope to be able to set up small learning centers that will allow my students to practice comprehension skills in a variety of ways. I hope to show them how to take small chunks of high-interest text and carefully examine each piece. My students will learn how to utilize graphic organizers to find the evidence that supports their answers. With the activities funded through this project, I hope to bring meaning to my students' reading. I want to show them that there is a purpose with all reading we do, whether it be learning new information or for pure entertainment. I hope to create life long readers!

Kennedy. A powerful statement that empowers me to provide my students with fun and interactive ways to keep their minds bursting with knowledge. My students have bright smiles that light up the classroom despite their disabilities that range from moderate to severe diagnosis. Each day they are exposed to functional learning experiences that engage their minds and help them to understand the world they are living in. Our school community welcomes students with disabilities and promotes an inclusive setting. It is in these exclusive settings that my students are able to work with their same age peers and develop friendships. Physical Education is an important part of my students' fine and gross motor skills development. My students need more instructional time to master movement concepts and instruction needs to be engaging, creative, and fun! The target toss and comet balls are one of the ways my students can work on their motor skills. The activity mats, toss and catch play set, and balancing spoon game are also ways to promote skills development while also teaching them cooperative play. These hands-on active play resources will help my students gain the practice they need not only through the school year, but also while attending summer school. Additionally, my students will also be learning new vocabulary, practicing math skills, and learning some science concepts. By having these additional opportunities to learn these academic skills, my students will begin to generalize the concepts and learn that language, math, and science can be done outside while having fun in the sun! As a first year Special Education teacher, my goal is to provide my students with the necessary skills to learn at their individual levels, while introducing functional concepts. The best way to accomplish this is to provide a variety of learning opportunities in multiple learning modalities. That is why this project is important to me. Your donation will help me expand our functional curriculum to the outdoors and that will not only benefit my students this year, but in years to come. Thank-you.

They need a way to organize their books to help them become independent readers by the end of the year. My class of six-year old and seven-year old students live in a close-knit, low-income neighborhood. Many of their parents also attended our school. They love to learn but many face hardships at home; including parents who are incarcerated, one parent homes, and parents who fight often in front of them. Many of my students come to school to escape difficulties at home. School is their bridge to success. I see myself not only as a teacher of content but a role model for what one can achieve through hard work and perseverance. I try to open their minds to what awaits them in the world and what possibilities their futures can hold. Learning to read can be a daunting task. Students need many experiences with reading books and other materials. These durable book holders will allow my students a special place to keep the books they are reading. Now, their books often get pushed into their desks, sometimes damaging the book, or fall out onto the floor. My students love to read so they try to hold onto several books at once. These book holders will allow them to more easily see the books they have chosen and which ones they want to return to our classroom library. They can carry the book holders with them when looking for a cozy place to read. These durable book holders will benefit my current students, as well as all of my future students. Learning to read is our mission. I want to provide them with many opportunities to acquire these important skills.

Although they are in high school, they learn at an elementary school level. Visual aids and hands-on experiences seem to be the most effective means of achieving understanding and interest. My students are learning all subjects, including social skills and functional skills. My students need to attend a Civil War reenactment experience to bring history to life. This would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the majority of my students. I have attended the Civil War reenactment, and I am positive that this field trip would be one that they will not soon forget. Not only will they get to see the Blue and the Gray at battle, they will also get to go through an encampment and see how Civil War soldiers lived during that time.

They make connections between Literature and Nonfiction, and what is happening today, in the real world. We debate, discuss, and infer together, and everyone is encouraged to 'show what they know'! Our school is unique because we are a public school but gifted, regular, and disabled students all attend classes together and there are lots of opportunities for cross grade interactions. It is normal to see students of all ability levels playing basketball with two students in wheelchairs, or a 4th grader teaching a 1st grader to sound out words, or how to design a catapult! Some 4th grade students visit 5th grade once a week because we do what is best for kids. We are an IMPACT Academy, that stresses Problem Solving and Positive attitudes, and as the front of our school announces, 'All students are welcome at Garden Grove!'. This year we will have 35 students in each of two fourth grade classrooms. We want to extend our Literature Circle book sets to include a Science Fiction genre (When you Reach Me), a realistic fiction (Because of Winn Dixie) and a Historical Fiction (By the Great Horn Spoon). Since we only receive about $100/year for books & supplies, these extra book sets, and art supplies of paint, pencils, paper and pastels are critical for our extension projects to provide readers additional ways to revisit what they've read, and continue the conversations and discoveries to create even more meaning. Game Boards, CD Covers, Character bookmarks, collages, ABC books, commemorative stamps, accordion books, paper story quilts and salt dough maps are some of the planned projects. Extra kids mean extra books and supplies needed! No one should be left without a book or art supplies! As more and more students are packed into our classrooms, we sometimes forget the power of one book-one student. While it is true students could share novels, there is something magical about curling up on the rug with your own book, reading at your own pace, and getting lost in that literary world for a while each day. These few extra sets of books mean one book/child . The art supplies mean there are enough supplies even for students who come from homes who cannot afford extras.

I am passionate about validating student work and growth. Displaying student work on a consistent basis expresses to them without words that their work is important. I want them to take pride in every piece of work they do. Also, students would benefit from testing partitions. The partitions would provide a focused and private environment for students during writing and assessments. A factor that contributes to students doing their best is creating the right environment.

The boys in my class come from an underprivileged part of North Minneapolis and most of them do not have the appropriate winter gear to stay warm at recess and on their way to and from school. My students desperately need your help in preparing them to stay warm these cold winter months with snow pants and gloves. With your help not only will my students stay warm and enjoy their time outside, but they will also feel like their community cares about their well being. These students deserve to be kids, and not worry about staying warm this winter but rather worry about what to build in the snow. This will not only enhance their sense of well being, but the sense of pride and comfort in their community.",My students need winter wear to keep warm in chilly Minnesota weather!,"Warmth, Care & Hunger",Grades PreK-2,Books,439.06,Fully Funded
f27cb3afb28f63ff9f36b0d4c51de8ff,A Better Tomorrow,"I teach at a Title I, performance improvement school with the majority of our students participating in the free lunch program. Many parents rely on a single income and some even work two jobs and still struggle to support their family. For many of my students, school is where they have access to books, supplies and other resources that support their academic achievement. I teach a special education class with 25 students that range from pre-kindergarten to 5th grade. Their disabilities range from learning disabilities to visually impaired. They come from a diverse background. Some students have limited verbal ability. Five students have limited motor skills, which limits their writing ability. Most are mainstreamed during the day into a regular education classroom. They are at least two years behind their peers. Many come from impoverished backgrounds with little parental involvement. This project will help my students improve their STEM skills and will help them bridge the gap. Our use of plastics has had a negative impact on marine life. The 5 Gyres Foundation estimates that there are 5.25 trillion plastic particles in the world's oceans which have had a devastating impact on many organisms like birds, turtles, marine animals and fish that have been entangled in or have ingested this plastic waste. Through free lessons and resources from The NEED Project and 5 Gyres Foundation, I will teach my students about plastic pollution, how our choices impact the Earth and how people are working to come up with solutions to reduce plastic use. We will simulate a small ocean in a dog pool. The robot will be used to clean up the pollution. We will use the Chromebook to research oil spills and pollution.",My students need exciting hands-on STEM activities that will teach them to care for our world using the Chromebook andmini robot.,"Math & Science, Special Needs",Grades 3-5,Computers & Tablets,392.2,Fully Funded
a575295e7766b878c3d8475d11f3e4f8,Chromebooks for Learning,"My third grade students love to learn new things and use technology in the classroom. We are fortunate that we are one of the few one to one laptop classrooms in our school which allows us to incorporate technology in all subjects. We are a STEAM Academy where the focus is on science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. Most of my students are low income and don't have the ability to use technology at home. They are are coming from the surrounding areas to attend a school that is often times better than their neighborhood school. Las Vegas also tends to have a very transient population, and many kids are constantly moving either into, out of, or around the city. As our classroom technology becomes outdated we need to continuously update our technology to provide learning opportunities for our students. We have several schoolwide programs such as ST math, Reading Plus, and Star Reading that require access to the internet. The Chromebooks will be used several times throughout the day to access our schoolwide programs and to create online projects. As we are teaching 21st-century skills such as coding the students need technology that can keep pace with the skills they are learning. Having access to technology that is updated and current help students complete projects quicker and improves their experience using technology.",My students need four Asus Chromebooks to replace outdated classroom technology.,"Literacy & Language, Math & Science",Grades 3-5,Computers & Tablets,2531.05,Live

I work with students with disabilities and those who are at risk for failure due to gaps in their education, as well as general education students. The students I work with are hardworking students. Many of my students are at school every day despite the hardships their families face, such as homelessness and food insecurity. Every day I work on empowering my students through their learning. I work on giving them successes in the classroom to help them reach their potential. So many times in the past few years I have noticed that students have so much trouble focusing on learning. They need many movement breaks and sometimes even that is not enough. There has been a push to offer flexible seating arrangements in classrooms. From everything I have seen and read, this has made a huge positive impact on attention and student learning. I would love a chance to offer this opportunity to my students using wobble chairs. This will give them a chance to be comfortable, select a working space, and be able to move.

They enjoy hands-on activities, working in small groups and being able to explore with their peers. My goal is to provide my students with an engaging, fun and safe learning environment. My school is located in a low social economic neighborhood where 95% of the students are on free or reduced price lunch. Most of my students are faced with many challenges in the classroom and at home. All of our students Kinder-5th grade use a computer program called Scientific Learning. This program helps provide a digital intervention to struggling readers and helps them continue to build upon the reading skills they already have. We need headphones with microphones so students can hear themselves read aloud to practice reading fluency. What a great way to help a struggling reader and help spark a love of reading by helping build their confidence. The headphones with microphones will be used by my students during daily Intervention time. They will use the Scientific Learning program to practice reading passages out loud to themselves. These headphones will also be shared with third and forth grade during their daily time.",My students need headphones with microphone for use in the computer lab.,"Math & Science, Literacy & Language",Grades 3-5,Instructional Technology,197.58,Fully Funded

I work with students who are labeled in many ways: ELL, LD, ID, BIP, IEP, SLP, apraxic, autistic, ADD, ADHD, ODD, and the list goes on. I'm working to help students remove their labels and find their feet, as well as their voices. My students come from a variety of backgrounds, but one thing they have in common is their thirst for creative learning opportunities. My students are studying insects and arthropods. We need lab coats and scrubs to feel profession and get into the role of productive scientists- and to protect our uniforms of course. Gender neutral lab coats and scrubs will help my students imagine themselves, girls and boys, as scientists during our STEM activities involving insects and worms! Ask a student what a scientist looks like and often they will say a man with crazy hair. My students need lab coats and scrubs to take part in our science lab. The second part of this project involves a stress-free, insect themed kite flying adventure. We read about, observe, measure and graph insects. Why not fly some as well. I think the more you have kids outside, the better for their overall development. Insect themed kites give students an opportunity and motivation to stay on task to get the outside reward.

4b3f57940eebc61fd352e1231c7be8d7,To Infinity and Flex-Space! 🚀,"The descriptive word that comes to mind when I think of a majority of my students is overcomers. Most of my class is made up of students that are labeled as 'migrant.' This means that they travel with their families as the crops change throughout the season. These students are always moving and normally spend their afternoons working with their parents and doing their homework alone because their parents do not speak any English. The other half of my students come from broken homes and currently live with one parent who tries their best to juggle life’s responsibilities. My students are overcomers and they WANT to learn. Currently, everyone in our county has free lunch and breakfast due to the overwhelming poverty rates and we receive government-funded snacks as well. Despite the odds, all of my students come to class every day with the determination to beat the cards that they have been dealt. When I work, I want to be comfortable and sometimes it is not at a desk. The same goes for the students that are in my classroom. This Flex-Space floor collaboration bundle will provide the students with a different option than a normal desk. Many students also have attention problems, being able to move and change seating can eliminate the behavior issues that may arise. The Flex-Space bundle will allow students to get on the floor comfortably together as they are collaborating in all subject areas. Students spend MOST of their school day in the classroom so their seating options need to fit their sensory needs. That may be having a chair that allows them to move, a classroom that they can collaborate, and even a spot where they can work in peace. These students are learning that a classroom is not just within the four walls of a classroom. It doesn't have to be a place that is orderly and uncomfortable. Help these students ditch average desks and go to infinity and FLEX-SPACE.

We are a Title I school with 100% of the students receiving free or reduced-price lunch. Our students come from a rural community with parents who want them to succeed and the best for them in life. My students are in first grade. We enjoy learning in a nontraditional environment and using technology to explore the world around us. My students are excited and love the opportunity to explore the world around them. They have been learning to work collaboratively and how to find solutions to real-world problems. This project is to teach my students about the importance of taking care of the Earth. In our classroom, we do all we can to help the environment including recycling and reusing. My students always look at things before they put them in the trash and ask if we really need to throw them away. They are the future and if they are empowered to take care of Earth, they will share their knowledge with others. There are three parts to this project that will enhance my student's learning of the importance of being responsible. They might be little, but they have great power. The first part is to help stock our Creation Station area in our classroom. In the Creation Station, students create projects out of materials that would have been thrown away. Currently, students sit in the floor, but wobble stools will allow them to have a place to sit as they reuse materials. We have a bits box where we place all leftover paper from any cutting projects we do in class as well as old magazines and newspapers. The second part of this project is to help us go green with classroom participation with LCD writing tablets. These tablets run off one battery for 5 or more years and can be used over and over by students. Students can use them instead of whiteboard and whiteboard markers. Whiteboard markers have to be thrown away after we use them. The third part of this project is new books about recycling will be used whole group for us to discuss why it is important to recycle and take care of the Earth. My students are intrigued by how things work. These books will help them to understand why we take care of the Earth and how they can.","My students need these books about recycling and caring for Earth, wobble chairs, and reusable writing tablets as these materials will help them learn how to care for Earth and how to create less waste.","Math & Science, Literacy & Language",Grades PreK-2,Flexible Seating,381.25,Fully Funded

Part 3,"Our Title I school is blessed with a culturally rich, diverse population, with ninety-two percent of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches, and a high concentration of English Language Learners. Sean Junkin's quote, 'So often you find that the students you're trying to inspire are the ones that end up inspiring you,' applies to my classroom every day. Our students have generous hearts that will change the world if they are given opportunities to share their passions and learning with others. They will inspire you, as they inspire me each day. Our first-grade students work hard at school to develop academic skills. Financial literacy is a life skill that all students would benefit from developing. We are requesting the junior edition of the classic board game, Monopoly, to develop financial literacy among our students and their families. Students learn best with they are engaged in hands-on experiences. This board game will provide hours of fun and practice with buying, saving and earning money. The junior edition of this classic game features single-digit banknotes for easier transactions for our young students. The Hasbro company states, ¨Monopoly Junior is a kid-friendly version of the classic board game you know and love. With single-digit bank notes for easier transactions and four adorable new tokens, kids will have a blast learning to count money and buy child-approved property such as an ice cream parlor or skate park.'
