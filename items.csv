My goal is to raise prevention through being educated and aware of the effects and consequences of bullying. They need to know how to access a science-base, research-validated curriculum via Internet and books. We are part of a small pre-k and kindergarten primary center. Our student population is less than 300 students. My students are learning to stand up to bullying. They are great kids discovering the world and learning to read and write. But I worry that next year when they leave our primary center and attend their neighborhood school (student population over 500) they will face a very different environment. I hope that the lessons that they have learned about friendships, kindness, and working cooperatively will reduce any instances of bullying. I want to raise awareness and educate my students so they can ask for help when they needed. Vigilance and discipline is the key! We know that knowledge is power; I want my students to know how to access information that will help them stand up to bullying. My project is to work with them in group discussions using their book, 'Bullying in Schools' as they will all have a copy to keep and share with their parents. I will use the tablet with a small group of four kids at a time. Together we will navigate web sites to watch videos and testimonials. They can then talk about it, share with their parents, and I can lead class discussions. There is access to information, articles and poems, and making them aware will educate them further on bullying. We must rise up and be the change to reach bullying in the heart of the problem. Bullying takes many forms and can happen in many contexts. Bullying is complex and there is no one size fits all solution for it, but knowledge is power. My students need to know how to find answers and information when they need it. This problem of bullying in schools is not one without a solution. We need every one helping teachers, parents, administrators and people in our community. The facts show that it is estimated that 160,000 children miss school every day due to fear of attack or intimidation by other students. Being aware of these facts should raise awareness and support. Your efforts will certainly have an impact. Together we can stand up to bullying. ","My students need 25 copies of 'Bullying in Schools' for each to keep, 'Stand Up For Yourself and Your Friends: Dealing With Bullies', 'A Smart Kid's Guide to Online Bullying' and a tablet to research specific websites that talk about prevention strategies on bullying.",Applied Learning,Grades PreK-2,Technology,361.8,Fully Funded

My students are just beginning that incredible journey into reading. I teach a large group of very excited 5 year olds who love to come to school and learn new things. They love to learn about and experience new things. They come from a low-income, rural area of South Carolina, but are very eager to learn new things. They attend a large elementary school which houses pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. Reading is a fundamental skill that is necessary for all subjects. As a kindergarten teacher my responsibility for laying that foundation for good reading skills is paramount. These books would not only help my kids learn to be better readers, but I think it would also help instill in them a passion for reading. They will begin to understand that reading can be fun as well! By donating to this project, you will help my students become better readers and prepare them to be better students and learners throughout their lives. They will have the opportunity to do better in school because they will have achieved success with reading early in their school careers.

47b8692b9ddb853be4e937ba5634d3cc,Help Us Work Together to End Bullying!,"Like many before us, children become leaders and problem-solvers by interacting meaningfully and safely with others. We need to learn how our actions affect each other, and encourage positive behaviors. Help me create a bully-free school where students thrive and grow into the leaders we will need! My students are a great group of children who live in a low-income, urban setting in southern California. Many come from hard-working, struggling families. My students' success is largely due to my use of proven teaching techniques that are effective for all learners, but especially English language learners which make up more than half of our population of students. The other huge factor in their success is their motivation, and understanding that their learning is tied to life outside the classroom: past, present, and most importantly, future! My classroom is structured on the belief that all students deserve a quality education and can achieve. Currently, my school is tackling the issue of bullying, and we are striving to create a community of learners who can interact meaningfully and easily together, rather than isolating each other. We just need support getting the materials we need to make learning engaging and effective for all students. Bullying is a real problem in today's schools. We need resources to engage students in serious conversations about bullying and tolerance. The best way to practice this after learning is to have the children working TOGETHER. For this reason, I am asking for small group and partner sets of carefully selected titles. The books will be read to the whole class and used in small group settings to address current issues, or prevent events before they occur. We will highlight issues that affect kids everyday, discuss the causes and effects of bullying, and empower students to act in those situations. Students will be able to apply their knowledge of bullying to famous leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr and George Washington, who stood up to bullying at racial and government levels. They will discuss and present about themes of kindness, inclusion, and personal responsibility towards others and the environment. Books about diagrams and charts will help them create collaborative posters. Each day, bullying is a more serious issue than the day before. Learning to work together on projects is an especially important opportunity as more isolated activities such as video games are a popular pastime for kids. These bullying resources are crucial to the positive experience of the students at our school. The skills and strengths that they develop now will stay with them as they go on to middle and high school. Thank you for your support of our school, education, and anti-bullying.

493c00b498844411aa4e7ce72cc6ca9a,There's Only One of Me!,"Do you remember what it felt like when you had your teacher's sole attention and it felt like you were the only child in the room? You needed some clarification or wanted a story read to you and your teacher was there. My goal is to be that teacher for my students, but sadly there's only one of me! I teach a group of energetic children who are eager to learn and who thrive on one-on-one attention. Our school is a very challenging, yet rewarding place to teach. Over 80% of our students qualify for free and reduced lunch, an indicator of poverty and high needs. Our children come to school with a very wide range of abilities and experiences. The struggles my students face daily sometimes can present obstacles in their quest to learn at the highest possible levels. I want to use every resource I can to level the 'playing field.' In other words, it is my mission to provide them with experiences and tools that will help them experience the most success possible. Independence is a key to success, but it is not always an easy skill for children to master. This is where small 'crutches' can help to bridge the gap towards independence. The AnyBook Reader would be one of these small 'crutches' that could aide in building independent learners as it presents a wealth of possibilities within the classroom. I teach in such a way that a large part of my day is spent with small groups or individual students. This means that the rest of my students must be actively engaged in meaningful activities. The AnyBook Reader with headphones could be used to provide directions to the myriad activities with which the students are engaged. Fluency could also be developed as the students listen to books that I read aloud or they could record their own voices as they read books aloud. ELL and Special Needs Students could benefit from the recording of visual schedules and the further explanation of concepts recorded just for them. The possibilities are endless! My students deserve the best educational experience possible. You have the opportunity to help me provide my students with a learning environment that meets their individual needs and will help them achieve at the highest level possible. When students have, within their reach, materials at their individual levels, it is as if a world of possibilities has been placed before them.

159b18c49967d8a4f290fc9f2cb227ab,Hearing is Believing!,"British accents, stand-up comedy, biographies of notable historical figures are just a few of the wonderful experiences that have come to life for my students in their listening center. My fifth graders are extremely hardworking and eager to learn, but they have trouble seeing the important role they will play in the future. They are becoming better readers and writers every day, but sometimes they are unable to make the connection between their education and real-life experience. Many of them are first generation Americans and only speak/hear English in school. They enjoy music and listening to stories. They are students that have all the potential to go much farther in life. Our charter school serves a hardworking low income urban community in New Jersey. We are a school that serves not only our students but we aim to include the 'community,' which includes parents and local community leaders. We all come together to promote education and educational experiences! These headphones for our listening center will help my students by being able to listen to great literature by great authors and biographical and historical stories about individuals and events that made an impact in our lives. I am a strong believer in small group instruction and literacy centers. While I sit with my small group or conduct one-on-one reading conferences, students need to be in meaningful engaging activities as to become independent and insightful readers. One of the literacy stations was a listening center where students listened to chapter books and then held meaningful discussions. The headphones stopped working recently and we have had to stop the center. My students have been learning how to read with passion and life, not just the sound of letters. These students need to be prepared to speak in public or interview. Listening to these stories was a stepping stone to their future. Until recently my fifth graders looked forward to hearing a story read to them. Children love being read to! My students need to experience all types of literacy engagement to help them understand the difference between saying words and being an effective speaker to all audiences. Whether informing, persuading or entertaining, proper articulation is key to becoming successful in any career path my students may choose for themselves.
