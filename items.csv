It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.""","""action, adventure, drama, history""","""roman, prince, chariot race, jerusalem, governor, politics, epic, friends, revenge, jewish, galley, galley slave""",1959,212,146900000.0,15000000.0,"""William Wyler""","""Charlton Heston, Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Stephen Boyd, Hugh Griffith, Martha Scott, Cathy O'Donnell, Frank Thring, Sam Jaffe, Ady Berber, Finlay Currie, André Morell, Terence Longdon, Lando Buzzanca, Giuliano Gemma, Marina Berti, Robert Brown, Liana Del Balzo, Enzo Fiermonte, Richard Hale, Duncan Lamont, John Le Mesurier, Ferdy Mayne, May McAvoy, Aldo Silvani, Ralph Truman, George Relph, Joe Canutt, Richard Coleman, Antonio Corevi, David Davies, Mino Doro, Michael Dugan, Franco Fantasia, José Greci, John Horsley, Howard Lang, Stevenson Lang, Tutte Lemkow, Cliff Lyons, Tiberio Mitri, Remington Olmsted, Laurence Payne, Aldo Pini, Diego Pozzetto, Stella Rho, Edwin Richfield, Hector Ross, Maxwell Shaw, Gianni Solaro, Pietro Tordi, Raimondo Van Riel, Dervis Ward, Joe Yrigoyen, Nazzareno Zamperla, Jerry Brown, Eddie Jauregui""","""Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)""","""United States of America""",14.319743,7.5,660,"""en""","""tt0052618""","""/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg""",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Feuillade’s well-meaning response to this brow-beating was another serial, the 12-part epic entitled Judex. The Plot: When his family is ruined by the unscrupulous banker Favraux, Jacques de Tremeuse resolves to bring him to justice. Adopting a disguise and the name Judex, he captures the crooked banker and takes him to his secret lair. Learning of Favraux’s dishonest ways, his daughter Jacqueline gives away his wealth when she learns of his death.

When Knobel writes and sells a volume of Hitler's (nonexistent) diaries, he thinks it's just another job.  When sleazy journalist Hermann Willié learns of the diaries, however, he quickly realizes their potential value... and Knobel is quickly in over his head. As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting. The film is a romping and hilarious satire, poking fun not only at the events and characters involved in the hoax (who are only thinly disguised in the film), but at the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.""","""history, comedy""","""female nudity, nazi background, portrait painting, hitler's diaries""",1992,115,0.0,0.0,"""Helmut Dietl""","""Götz George, Uwe Ochsenknecht, Christiane Hörbiger, Harald Juhnke, Ulrich Mühe, Rolf Hoppe, Dagmar Manzel, Veronica Ferres, Hermann Lause, Martin Benrath, Georg Marischka, Karl Schönböck, Rosemarie Fendel, Wolfgang Menge, Hark Bohm, Willy Harlander, Thomas Holtzmann, Hans-Joachim Hegewald, Peter Roggisch, Günter Junghans, Armin Rohde, Michael Kessler, Martin Feifel""","""Bavaria Film, Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)""","""Germany""",0.8656149999999999,6.7,16,"""de""","""tt0105328""","""/nhcbyqalhtDbbhnoKCYZdtOIRHk.jpg""",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After the attacks, these followers were left to rebuild the religion where they had once found peace in the face of overwhelming, and understandable, condemnation from the rest of Japan. Central focus is placed on Hiroshi Araki, a young man who finds himself elevated to chief spokesman for Aum after its leaders are arrested. Araki faces extreme hostility from the Japanese public, who find it hard to believe that most followers of the cult had no idea of the attacks and even harder to understand why these followers remain devoted to the religion, if not the violence.""","""documentary, foreign""","""aum shinrikyo""",2001,131,0.0,0.0,"""Tatsuya Mori""",nan,nan,"""Japan""",0.102332,0.0,0,"""en""","""tt0318960""","""/yZhsMgsrv4TgvM7qH1SBwtB0if9.jpg""",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
