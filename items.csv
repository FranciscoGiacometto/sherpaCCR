2274d68de7068287375b9d025ceba625,Collaboration Station in the RJE Learning Commons,"We are acquiring more and more technology at RJE, mobile technology, in particular. While this is exciting, we struggle to find spaces for students to use it. I feel that if we have a fun, kid friendly space that will facilitate an environment of collaboration and teamwork, kids will flock to it! RJE has 636 students, and they are very social. They love to play together and work together. In fact, teachers encourage students to work together to encourage cooperation and compromise. It also allows our students to learn from one another. They like the affiliation aspect of learning. My goal is to use our collaboration station area for working in groups, particularly with technology. We are fortunate to have many iPads on our campus that are intended for student use. With the collaboration station, students could use our tablets or other devices and collaboratively work on a project. They could even use this shared space to visit and communicate with students outside of our campus via Skype or Face Time. The furniture that I am requesting will facilitate a coworking environment and encourage children to work together and use our mobile technology in a collaborative, cooperative way. I would be thrilled to offer my students this modern learning space for their studies. I want to provide a book store or coffee house setting that will appeal to our 21st century learners as well as accommodate discussions and our mobile technology. I am requesting a 5 piece Wesco Modular Square Soft Seater that sits low to the ground and will accommodate up to 8 students and/or staff. Each piece is a bright color and there is a center piece for materials and such. Currently, we have rectangular tables, which are well suited for classes and meetings, but they are not ideal for a small group, who may want to meet privately and/or have small group discussions. With the furniture that I am requesting, the seating will be perfect for small groups that are working on a project together, and a perfect place for students to use mobile technology together. If RJE receives this seating option, I will complete the collaboration station by adding a stationary iPad. I want to provide our students with furniture that will be fun and colorful. Schools must align their classroom environments with real world environments in order to prepare our students for the future. To do that, schools must practice the 4 Cs: critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity. My students need a go to space to work together that will allow them to talk, ask questions, and practice their critical thinking skills. I want to provide a setting that will appeal to our 21st century learners and accommodate collaboration at its finest!

Students attend a neighborhood elementary school with a high rate of students qualifying for free and reduced lunches. Many of my students come from very challenging backgrounds. The books I am requesting are all centered around teaching and building social and life skills. I think it is an important part of a student's educational experience for us to introduce, model, and reinforce positive social behavior. My responsibility is to make sure that the students have the tools they need to be successful in school and give them skills they need to become good citizens. My students need books that will capture their attention and provide opportunities for learning character education and social/life skills. The counseling resources that I have requested promote life skills such as respect, responsibility, empathy,good manners, honesty, anger management and teamwork. Life-skills are an important component of a well-rounded education.

I want my kindergarten students to have the same experience, a favorite book that they can recall when they are grown! I teach in a magnet school and I have 23 enthusiastic, fun-loving kindergarteners. My kindergarteners come from a wide range of family dynamics, some live in traditional households while others live in single parent households, and others live with extended family. My students' economic situations are just as varied as their family dynamics and sixty percent of my class qualifies for free lunch. Regardless of these factors, every one of my students possesses a passion for learning, exploring, and playing! I am requesting a set of Elephant and Piggie books by Mo Willems and information texts about weather. Mo Willems writes books that are loved by kindergarteners and my class is no exception! Each week when my students go to media many of them return with one of his Elephant and Piggie books. I would like to have a set of these popular books in our classroom so that my class can enjoy them on a regular basis. I am also requesting some weather themed informational texts. After reading a Weekly Reader, my students became fascinated with all different types of weather, but especially tornadoes! The weather and tornado books will enable my students to continue to learn about a subject they enjoy. By donating to this project you will give my students books that they will enjoy and that are kindergarten appropriate.

Putting in notes using midi keyboards would be much easier than using laptop track pads. My students are middle school students attending a magnet school for the gifted in Illinois. These students are taught using inquiry based teaching and are highly motivated to learn new things. Most have attended the same school for gifted students since first grade. In our music classes, we introduce composing using computers. Despite some having limited experience with music instruction, students don't balk at trying this new concept, and embrace it with enthusiasm. My students need 12 midi keyboards for our composing classes. My students have been entering notes in the Finale program, by clicking on each individual staff line or space to place the notes. This is difficult enough with a mouse, but we are using laptops, making it even trickier. With the purchase of these midi keyboards, students will be able to plug them in and play the note they wish to place instead. This will not only speed up their composing process, but will help them to learn the location of notes on a piano keyboard as well. Introducing these children to creating music is an important part of their education. Creativity is highly valued in the work place and this project could potentially impact their future careers. Being a risk taker and stepping out of ones comfort zone is just the sort of life preparation we like to provide for these students.

We know that readers are drawn to books that speak to some part of their own identities or experiences. That is why I am requesting these excellent books to add to my ESL classroom library. My students are all English learners. They come to our school from around the globe, eager to learn and excited to be in an American school. Many of them are refugees from war-torn countries like Burundi, the Congo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Reading is challenging for many of them--especially for those who've missed several years of school for economic or safety reasons prior to moving to the U.S. I have been growing my classroom library with books from rummage sales and used bookstores, but I would love to be able to offer my students more books with characters they can identify with. My students deserve to have access to a wide range of fiction and nonfiction texts that allow them to explore and validate their own identities as immigrants and young people of color. These 22 texts were carefully chosen, and many of them have won awards or are on Teaching For Change's recommended reading lists. I know my students will devour them as soon as we get them into the classroom, and that they will be well-loved for years to come.

Once the 'chest' is open, students are touched with the treasure of reading. Reading holds the key to students success! Most of my students come from homes that are underprivileged. They have limited access to books outside of school. Most of their engagement with texts happens in the classroom or the school library. Our school is home to a population of 93% children of poverty. Even though most of my students face hardship, they come to school excited about learning, especially reading. With the resources I've requested, my students will be interacting in reading literacy centers. I've requested grade level book sets to have my students engage in book groups. This opportunity would allow them to discuss books as a group and learn together. I've also requested some picture books to read aloud to my students. We will use these texts to show how authors use writing in powerful ways, practice reading comprehension skills, and use before, during, and after reading strategies. With these powerful tools, my students' reading comprehension and enjoyment will increase. I hope to see a positive boost in reading success levels with the use of these resources. This project is immensely crucial to impact student learning. I believe in exposing children to great literature and to use authors as supplemental teachers in my classroom.

Many of the headphones that are on our mobile lab are 5 years old and are broken. Many of my 3rd graders cannot hear the math problems or the stories on Successmaker, which is our individualized learning program. Our charter school has students from a broad economic background. Many families are Title One families. We have to rely on the support of grants or donations to get most of our technology. Unfortunately, when we have our mobile computer lab, many of the students are frustrated because we do not have enough headphones for the students to use. Many of the original headphones are now 5 years old and broken. There are no headphones to use. The students cannot hear the Successmaker program. All students benefit with reading and listening to the program. It helps with their fluency as well. Students who have a low reading level are at a particular disadvantage using our Successmaker program because they cannot read accurately and with fluency the problems on the computer screen without headphones. I believe all of my students need reliable headphones. If each child has their very own headphone to be responsible for, I believe that they will last several years. My Project: The most important computer program in our school for math and reading is our Successmaker computer program. Successmaker is unique in that it can find the student's ability level through questions and problems that the student answers. Then Successmaker individualizes the program to each student's abilities. With a headphone, each one of my students will be able to understand not only by sight, but by hearing the words and sounds all of the educational activities on Successmaker. This will definitely impact the ability of my students to learn their math and reading in 3rd grade. Each of my students will succeed and get confident in their understanding of important concepts of the Common Core. When each student has their own headphone, they will be responsible for a certain labeled headphone that will be placed in a storage bin. I have students of all levels of reading and math ability that need to understand through sight and sound the educational activities on Successmaker.

Each child had a copy of the book while I read aloud to them. Every single student was engaged! Day by day they anticipated what will happen next. Students also created a 'Sassy Journal' exploring point of view. My students are third graders with a real passion for hands-on learning through books. When reading aloud to them I see the sparkle in their eyes, but I also see them more engaged if they also have a copy of the book I am reading. It is often difficult to keep their attention for long periods of time. This, however, is NOT the case when it comes Sharon Draper's book 'Sassy-Little Sister is not my name!' This was one of the most rewarding times I spent with my students with a chapter book. There were chapter questions for each chapter where students had to revisit the chapter to answer. There were opportunities for creativity when students wrote in the character's point of view. After we finished book 1, the students said, 'This was the best book ever! Are we reading book 2-4?' Our school is comprised of all of the third and fourth graders in our district. We are located in a low-income area with a high rate of students receiving free or reduced lunch. My students will use the classroom sets of the chapter book series of 'Sassy,' by author Sharon M. Draper, during our reading block. During this time we sit in a 'U' shape with our desks and engage ourselves in book discussions for every chapter. We will answer questions created that are Common Core driven. Creativity will be involved, as they create their 'Sassy' journals, and students will be able to each have a copy where they will be able to work in literature circles with their peers. The book will also serve as a resource if students need to review the text for an activity or lesson involving the book. The students will be able to learn about writing point of view from a chapter book. The students will also be able to better understand a book through well thought out questions; based on the chapters and created by the Sharon Draper website.

I would love to have Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They would also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. Students could build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class will inspire teamwork, encourage perseverance, and promote a positive attitude towards solving math problems. Learning to persevere through problem situations is invaluable to my students. For most of them, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated.

We have been researching how one goes about writing, directing, and producing a newscast. Our first broadcast was very rudimentary and we want to greatly improve the quality of our videos. My students are part of an enrichment class in a rural school in Ohio. They are tremendously enthused with this project! They are learning that creating these broadcasts can be very difficult. With more sophisticated cameras, they hope to be able to make the news more polished. The students absolutely will use the tripod effectively. They have been balancing my phone on top of a table and the video jumps around a little too much. The GoPro camera would allow us to produce a higher quality video and give us room for experimentation with other ways of filming! I believe this project will change these students lives in many ways. They are experiencing how to work together effectively and make decisions. They are learning skills useful in a technological world. They are learning responsibility, respect and resourcefulness.

These students have dreams and goals, and I am trying to help them reach those goals. My school is a great place to learn, and stretches every dollar to the maximum for our students. Each student will use the new keyboards and mice to become computer literate. These students will not have to worry anymore about having keyboards that do not respond to touch. The mice that will be used will work without having to be maneuvered into the 'sweet spot'. It is extremely frustrating to try to learn to type on a keyboard that is not responsive, or that has certain keys that stick no matter what. The gift of new keyboards and mice would alleviate this problem. My students are trying to learn skills to help them be competitive in the workplace in the future. They want to become successful members of the community, and you could help them realize their potential by providing working keyboards and mice.

Math needs to be hands-on and active. Children need to work together to solve problems and persevere. Gifted math students need to be pushed and challenged. We are classified as a 'rural fringe' school. We serve about 950 students in our Elementary, grades pre K-6. 42% of our elementary students are low income and we are a Title one school. My students have been identified as gifted in Mathematics. They come to me every day for their math instruction. They are so much fun. They love to learn and still get excited about new activities. I also visit classrooms in grades 1-4 to share enrichment lessons with all students. I love having Legos available to my students so we can act out story problems and create problems for each other. They also help students develop their visual-spatial skills, which are slipping more and more with our reliance on technology. With the addition of the cubelets students will build machines to conduct experiments that lead to using math in real situations. For example: Students could build catapults, shoot objects across the room, measure, compare, graph, make adjustments to their machines and try again. These are valuable STEM activities that my young students can still do. Legos in math class inspires teamwork, encourages perseverance, and promotes a positive attitude towards solving math problems. For most of my students, things come easily and they come to believe that it should always be easy. When they hit a road block, they don't know what to do. It can be difficult to find things that will challenge them enough without making them too frustrated. I want them to experience the true self-esteem that comes from sticking with hard problems. These are lessons that will carry them well into college and life.

Since every child is different, I believe in having different choices and opportunities for them. They love having a voice and choice in their seating arrangement and activities during the day. My dream is to set up my classroom like a coffee shop. When you go into a coffee shop to do some work, you have choice. I don't have someone telling me my spot for the remainder of my time there. I have the choice to pick my seat. I also have the choice to change my mind and sit somewhere else during my time at the coffee shop. My students love the opportunity to have a voice in the classroom. Having different seating options will really help them in determining where they want to complete their work. Setting my classroom up as a coffee shop will really emphasize the type of learning environment my students want and need. I want to lower one desk and have the deluxe sit-upons as an option for students who want to work at a desk but in a different way. Wobble chairs around a table would be the perfect asset to my classroom for those students who like to move while they work. Other things I plan on doing is having one table with chairs and one table that will be raised up to be a stand and learn desk.
