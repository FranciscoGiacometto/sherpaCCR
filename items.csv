e5e95dd8da1f427ff94217582657f009,Whiteboards,"My students are very active and need to be engaged in their learning. Using whiteboards individually helps each student practice standards and skills to be successful in 1st grade. The whiteboards will help them quickly practice without wasting a lot of paper. The children in my district come from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. All the children have the desire to learn. Some, do not have the family support necessary to encourage success. My students want to be cared about and want positive reinforcement for their good deeds. Our school tries to provide the children with a 'family' style atmosphere, hoping that each child thrives in his/her life. My students need double-sided whiteboards to create an enriching classroom learning environment. The white boards we have currently are ones that I have made. They are white construction paper put into a see-through sleeve. These homemade whiteboards are very flimsy and do not last long. If our class has the hard-back whiteboards, they would last for a very long time and we would be able to practice standards and skills learned throughout the day. Students will use the lined side of the whiteboard to practice writing words or short responses. Students will use the blank side to brainstorm or complete mathematical equations. These whiteboards will ensure that all students are actively learning and participating in whole group lessons as well as practicing during their independent time. Please help us get our whiteboards! I can assure you that this would be an educational tool that would get its use in our classroom. My students this year and many years to come will utilize them daily.

That is how it was for my first graders when I introduced them to the Elephant and Piggie series by Mo Willems. They so love Piggie and her friend Gerald that the characters feel like two more kids in our classroom! I teach at a public alternative school. The literacy workshop curriculum keeps the students active and engaged. Like every primary teacher, my class includes kids who are already reading, as well as kids who are just dipping their feet in the water. It is for this latter group, in particular, that I am requesting a Donors Choose grant. I hope to buy a large set of these magical books that kids won't put down! I hope you'll come on board with me! Beginning readers confidently read what each character is saying because they have learned their personalities and ways of interacting. Pictures of them and their talking balloons have started surfacing in the students' drawings and I have even heard familiar exchanges during the kids' spontaneous drama. I knew we were on to something good, but unfortunately, there are not enough books in the classroom or library to satisfy this thirst. I want to use the Elephant and Piggie books in Readers Theater activities with students to help them build confidence and voice as readers. A larger collection of them can increase their use as take home, read-aloud-to-family books, because they are books these kids are dying to read aloud. When the occasional book is left at home, the other kids will not feel so disappointed. Elephant and Piggie will also contribute to my students' growth as writers, as the kids are already drawing these beloved characters and captioning their conversations with speech bubbles modeled after those in the texts. More copies spread out on the tables will invite them to add words they have memorized, or copy words that express what they want to say. Sight words will serve the greatest purpose (rather than flashcard practice), rounded out with best guess spelling that builds phonics knowledge and fluency with writing. In short, Elephant and Piggie (and the Pigeon) inspire, and inspired readers are fearless readers. Because my children believe in and love the voices of these characters and their friends (yes, there is a snake, a bat, a bird...), they are building their own voices as readers in order to spend time with these characters, and then extending that inspiration in writing. Please help build our collection of these go-to books--and contribute to building our skills as readers and writers!

The students, even though they have challenges at home, are happy to come to school and determined to participate in learning. In today's technology, fast paced, standards-based driven educational world, the demands on students as learners is higher than ever. However, in my particular classroom (and many other classrooms in my building), the students are knowledge hungry and not afraid to struggle to improve their learning. The students in my room need to read a variety of complex texts for multiple purposes. The students also need to find evidence to support their learning. Having the evidence kits will help my students read nonfiction and fiction text while being able to find key details, compare and contrast, summarize,discuss vocabulary and find the theme for multiple grade level texts. During the school day, we will use white boards for multiple reasons and in multiple subject areas. With the white boards the students can practice their work and show their thinking. Students also hold up white boards in whole group lessons so the teacher can get a snapshot of learning and understanding to provide more intense intervention/small group time when needed.

For many of our students, they are first or second generation Americans and are new to the English language. Many students receive free and reduced-price lunch and come from high poverty homes. Regardless of their backgrounds, we collaborate with the community, engage and empower every student engineer to reach their maximum potential. This project will enable our students to have charter bus transportation so they can to go to the Roanoke Island Festival Park. Here they will pump the bellows in the blacksmith shop or use a cross-cut saw to cut a log. They will become a tradesman, and explore all about 16th century life in the days of the Roanoke Voyages, including the Elizabeth II, a representative 16th-century sailing ship. Even though our students live less than 3 hours away from the Outer Banks, most have never visited the beach, must less toured a ship. Having this opportunity would culturally enrich our students. They will be able to discover Roanoke Island's place in history as the birthplace of English-speaking America. Help our young explorers set sail on an adventure of a lifetime. Donating to this project will help create an opportunity for our students that they may never get to otherwise. Every child should have wonderful opportunities to travel and explore new places.

My students need headphones so that they can hear the various sounds that accompany the educational websites that they visit to help support their reading, writing, and math skills. We also need a wireless keyboard and mouse so that I can easily facilitate students viewing educational videos, using PowerPoints, and playing educational review games from the front of the room.

It can be frustrating for kids who aren't yet reading higher-level texts, however, because they want to be able to read about their interests, too. Our classroom library just doesn't have enough books at the lower levels these kids need. The collection of books I am requesting includes informational books about topics of high interest to 2nd and 3rd graders. While high-interest, the books are at a lower reading level so they can be accessed by all students. My students will use these books during our daily Reading Workshop. The sets will be used for guided reading when the students will receive reading support in a small group from a teacher. The other books will be used during independent reading time so children can read about topics that interest them.

Our school culture of perseverance and hard work provides our large student body with the tools and resources to succeed on a daily basis. All of our students, including students with special needs and ESL, are provided with daily instruction using a variety of hands-on, experiential learning opportunities. In addition to classroom instruction, students are provided with a variety of specialties in physical education, visual arts, technology, and music. As the music teacher, I have witnessed a natural passion and enthusiasm, in all of our students, for creating music. They are always ready and eager to fully engage themselves in daily music education. With your help, we can enhance their music education to help them achieve their personal musical goals and dreams!It is well known that music is extremely beneficial to childhood development. Learning to play an instrument, such as the ukulele, provides students with many benefits, which are applied inside and outside of the music classroom. When students learn to play the ukulele, fine motor and coordination skills are developed as students learn strumming and chord patterns. Students develop and build their listening skills as they tune their own instruments and learn to play a variety of songs. When playing in an ensemble, students work collaboratively and collectively, improving their social and emotional skills on a daily basis. In the music classroom, students will compose their own songs, which provides students multiple opportunities for creativity and risk-taking. In my years teaching music, I have seen how music education, in which students sing and play instruments, provides an outlet for creativity and individuality. I have seen my students grow out of shyness and self-doubt, and have seen them blossom into strong, self-aware, performing artists.

However, many of these students have low self-esteem and don't have much confidence in themselves. Their lives are full of personal struggles and limited to almost no recognization or praise, so when these students come to school, I make it my number one priority to make them feel loved, appreciated, and special when they accomplish positive tasks or obligations. I am requesting small toys, treats, prizes, such as stress balls, writing pens and paper, stress-free coloring books, Yo-Yo, play dough, kids stampers, notebooks, activity books, and other items for my treasure box that will be available schoolwide to all students. I am requesting these items for my treasure box because I am the one person that provides prizes and rewards to the entire school for the students. I provide these prizes, treats, and rewards because many of these students do not get the chance or opportunity to celebrate the small but wonderful accomplishments that they make while in school. These small toys, treats, prizes will make a difference in these students lives by lifting their confidence, making them feel worthy, providing them with opportunities to be recognized for being an important part of their school.","My students need rewards, treats, and small toys to help lift their self-esteem and overall emotional well-being!",Special Needs,Grades 3-5,Educational Kits & Games,794.72,Fully Funded
